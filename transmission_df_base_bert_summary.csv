Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs 4 . However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species likely harbor the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries 5-7 . Here we conduct the most comprehensive analysis yet of mammalian hostvirus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species, and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy, and human population within a species range -which may reflect human-wildlife contact. We demonstrate for the first time that bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' and therefore of highest value for future surveillance. We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people. Viral zoonoses are a serious threat to public health and global security, and have caused the majority of recent pandemics in people 4 , yet our understanding of the factors driving viral diversity in mammals, viral host range, and cross-species transmission to humans remain nascent. Recent studies have described broad patterns of pathogen host range 1,3 and various host or microbial factors that facilitate cross-species transmission 5,7,8 , or have focused on Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use: http://www.nature.

Here we create then analyze a database of 2,805 mammal-virus associations, including 754 mammal species (14% of global mammal diversity) from 15 orders and 586 unique viral species (every recognized virus found in mammals 16 ) from 28 viral families (Methods). We use these data to test hypotheses on the determinants of viral richness and viral sharing with humans. We fit three inter-related models to elucidate specific components of the process of zoonotic spillover (Extended Data Fig. 1 ). First, we identify factors that influence total viral richness (i.e. 'baseline' number of unique viral species found in a given host, including those which may have the potential to infect humans). Second, we identify and rank the ecological, phylogenetic, and life-history traits that make some species more likely hosts of zoonoses than others. Third, recognizing that not all mammalian viruses will have the biological capacity to infect humans, we identify and rank viral traits that increase their likelihood of being zoonotic.
 In examining the raw data, we found that observed viral richness within mammals varies at a host order and viral family level, and is highest for Bunya-, Flavi-, and Arenaviruses in rodents; Flavi-, Bunya-, and Rhabdoviruses in bats; and Herpesviruses in non-human primates (Extended Data Fig. 2 ). Of 586 mammalian viruses in our dataset, 263 (44.8%) have been detected in humans, 75 of which are exclusively human and 188 (71.5% of human viruses) zoonotic -defined operationally here as viruses detected at least once in humans and at least once in another mammal species (Methods). The proportion of zoonotic viruses is higher for RNA (159/382, 41.6%) than DNA (29/205, 14 .1%) viruses. The observed number of viruses per wild host species was comparable when averaged across orders, but bats, primates, and rodents had a higher proportion of observed zoonotic viruses compared to other groups of mammals (Fig. 1) . Species in other orders (e.g. Cingulata, Pilosa, Didelphimorphia, Eulipotyphla) also shared a majority of their observed viruses with humans, but data were limited in these less diverse and poorly-studied orders. Several domestic ungulate species (orders Cetartiodactyla and Perissodactyla) are outliers for their number of observed viruses, but these species have a relatively low proportion of zoonotic viruses ( Fig. 1 ; Supplementary Discussion).
 Previous analyses show that zoonotic disease emergence events and human pathogen species richness are spatially correlated with mammal and bird diversity 2, 17 . However, these studies weight all species equally. In reality, the risk of zoonotic viral transmission, or spillover, likely varies among host species due to differences in underlying viral richness, opportunity for contact with humans, propensity to exhibit clinical signs that exacerbate viral shedding 18 , other ecological, behavioral and life-history differences 5, 12, 15 , and phylogenetic distance from humans 10 . We hypothesize that the number of viruses a given mammal species shares with humans decreases with phylogenetic distance from humans and increases with opportunity for human contact. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to identify and rank host-specific predictors (ecological, life history, taxonomic, and phylogenetic traits, and a control for research effort) of the number of total and zoonotic viruses in mammals (Methods; Supplementary Table 1 ).
 The best-fit model for total viral richness per wild mammal species explained 49.2% of the total deviance, and included per species measures of disease-related research effort, phylogenetically-corrected body mass, geographic range, mammal sympatry, and taxonomy (order) (Fig. 2a-e) . Not surprisingly, research effort had the strongest effect on the total number of viruses per host, explaining 31.9% of the total deviance for this model (Extended Data Table 1 ). The remaining 17.3% can be explained by biological factors, a value greater than or comparable to studies examining much narrower groups of mammal hosts 10, 12, 15 (Supplementary Discussion). Mammal sympatry was the second most important predictor of total viral richness (Fig. 2d) . Our model selection consistently identified mammal sympatry calculated at a ≥20% area overlap over other thresholds explored (Methods), providing insight into the minimum geographic overlap needed to facilitate viral sharing between hosts. Host geographic range was also significantly associated with increasing total viral richness, although the strength of this effect was low (Fig. 2c) . Several mammalian orders, Chiroptera (bats), Rodentia (rodents), Primates, Cetartiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), and Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates) listed here in order of relative deviance explained, had a significantly greater viral richness than predicted (Fig. 2e ). This finding highlights these taxa as important targets for global viral discovery in wildlife 4 , and suggests that traits not captured in our analysis (e.g. immunological function, social structure, and other life-history variables) may underlie their capacity to harbor a greater number of viral species. Our models to predict total viral richness were comparable when excluding virus-host associations detected by serology, i.e. using the 'stringent data', and were robust when validated with random cross-validation tests (Extended Data Table 1; Supplementary Table  2 ). However, we identified several regions that showed significant bias when cross validated by excluding mammals from zoogeographic areas, suggesting that there are location-specific factors that remain unexplained in our models (Methods; Supplementary Table 3 ).
 Our best model to predict the number of zoonotic viruses per wild mammal species explained 82% of the deviance, and included phylogenetic distance from humans, a ratio of urban to rural human population across a species range, host order, whether or not a species is hunted, research effort, and total viral richness (Extended Data Table 1) . A large fraction of the deviance explained is driven by the observed total viral richness per host -supporting the biological assumption that the number of viruses that infect humans scales positively with the size of the potential 'zoonotic pool' 19 in each reservoir host. Removing this contribution by including observed total viral richness per host as an offset, the model explains 33% of the total deviance in the proportion of viruses that are zoonotic (Methods), with 30% of total deviance explained by biological factors (Fig. 2f-i) . Several mammalian orders had both a significant positive (bats) and negative (two ungulate orders) effect on the proportion of zoonotic viruses (Fig. 2i) . A number of previous studies have proposed that bats are special among mammals in being reservoir hosts of a large number of recently emerging high profile zoonoses (e.g. SARS, Ebola virus, MERS) 12, 13, 20 . Our study, for the first time, tests this hypothesis in the context of all known mammalian viruses and hosts. While other mammalian orders have relatively high proportions of observed zoonoses and others have been poorly studied (Fig. 1a) , our model results show that bats are host to a significantly higher proportion of zoonoses than other mammalian orders after controlling for reporting effort and the other predictor variables.
 We found that the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species increases with host phylogenetic proximity to humans, and that this relationship is significant even when we removed 'reverse zoonoses' primarily associated with transmission from humans to primates (Methods). This is the first time this relationship has been demonstrated using data for all mammals and specifically as a determinant of zoonotic spillover, and is supported by previous taxon-specific studies that have examined host relatedness and parasite/pathogen sharing in primates 9,10 , bats 14 , and plants 21 . The proportion of zoonotic viruses shows some upward drift for mammals that are very phylogenetically distant from humans (Fig. 2g ) that may represent an artifact of preferentially screening marsupials for human viruses. While primate species largely drive the phylogenetic effect, our best-fit model excluded the effect of the order Primates as a discrete variable (Fig. 2i ) -suggesting that continuous variation in phylogenetic distance across primate species is more important, and is significant even when all mammals are included. This finding highlights the need to uncover the mechanism by which phylogeny affects spillover risk, e.g. evolutionarily related species sharing host cell receptors and viral binding affinities 22, 23 and specific viral mutations that may expand host range in related mammal species 24 .
 We tested several measures to estimate human-wildlife contact at a global scale for the 721 wild mammals in our dataset, but only the ratio of urban to rural human population (all data model), the change in human population density, and the change in urban to rural population ratio from 1970-2005 across a species range (stringent data model) were included (Extended Data Table 1 ). The response curve for urban to rural population suggests that increasing urbanization raises the risk of zoonotic spillover (Fig. 2h) , as does increasing human population density and the change in urban to rural population ratio over time. A single global metric of human-wildlife ecological contact did not emerge across models. However, the alternate inclusion of these related variables points to the importance of human-animal contact in defining per species spillover risk globally, and the need for controlled field experiments and human behavioral risk studies to uncover the mechanisms underlying this risk. Overall, the strength of the effect of phylogenetic distance was stronger than our proxies for animal-human contact in predicting proportion of zoonoses (30-44% stronger explanatory factor), but both remained significant after controlling for research effort (Extended Data Table 1 ).
 The predominance of zoonoses of wildlife origin in emerging diseases has led to a series of programs to sample wildlife, discover novel viruses, and assess their zoonotic potential 4, 23, [25] [26] [27] . To inform their scale and scope we calculate the expected number of asyet undiscovered viruses and zoonoses per host species using our best-fit GAMs and a scenario of increased research effort (Methods, Supplementary Table 4 ). We then project these 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' geographically ( Fig. 3 , Extended Data Figs. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] to identify regions of the world where targeted, future surveillance to find new viruses and zoonoses will be most effective. In the process of translating our non-spatial, specieslevel predictions to geographic space, we identified several regions where our model predictions of the number of total and zoonotic viruses were systematically biased (hatched regions - Fig. 3 and Extended Data Figs. 3-8; Methods). Local factors contributing to this bias may include geographic variation in the detection probability of human and/or wildlife viruses, indicating areas where additional research and capacity strengthening for viral detection are most needed. Our model predictions were not systematically biased or clustered across host phylogeny (Extended Data Fig. 9 ).
 Geographic hotspots of 'missing zoonoses' vary by host taxonomic order, with foci for carnivores and even-toed ungulates in Eastern and Southern Africa, bats in South and Central America and parts of Asia, primates in specific tropical regions in Central America, Africa, and Southeast Asia; and rodents in pockets of North and South America and Central Africa. Areas where 'missing zoonoses' predictions were systematically biased varied by taxonomic order, but included large parts of Africa for the all mammal dataset (Fig. 3a , Extended Data Figs. 3-8f). In contrast, the distribution of bias in predicting the 'missing viruses' for all mammals was limited to patches of northeastern Asia, Greenland, Peninsular Malaysia, and scattered grid cells in Western Asia and Patagonia (Extended Data Fig. 3c ). We also identify geographic regions with large numbers of mammal species currently lacking any information regarding their viral diversity (Extended Data Figs. 3i-8i). In combination, these maps can be used for cost effective allocation of future resources for viral discovery programs, such as the recently proposed ""Global Virome Project"" 27 .
 Finally, a significant challenge to preventing future disease emergence is estimating the zoonotic potential of a newly-discovered viral species or strain based on viral traits 4-6,28 . The best model for determining whether or not a known virus (n=586 mammalian viruses) has been observed as zoonotic explained 27.2% of total deviance and included maximum phylogenetic host breadth (PHB -a virus-specific trait that measures the phylogenetic range of known hosts, excluding humans), research effort, whether or not a virus replicates in the cytoplasm, is vector-borne, or is enveloped, and average genome length (Fig. 4 ). Using the 'stringent' dataset to define whether a virus is zoonotic resulted in a reduced model that excluded enveloped status and genome length (Extended Data Table 1 ). Our findings confirm a positive relationship between zoonotic potential and ability to replicate in the cytoplasm 7 , and that viruses with arthropod vectors may be able to infect a wider range of mammalian hosts 5 . Our phylogenetically-explicit measure of host breadth, PHB, can be used at various hierarchical taxonomic levels to quantify and rank viruses from specialist to generalist, and was the strongest predictor of zoonotic potential (12.4% of total deviance explained). This highlights the value of field programs to identify the natural host range of newly discovered pathogens in order to develop early proxies for their zoonotic potential 4 . Significant variation in PHB across viral families is suggestive of intrinsic differences in a virus' ability to infect diverse hosts, and this relates to the proportion of observed zoonoses in each family (Fig. 4a) .
 We acknowledge several important caveats. First, our estimates of 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' per species are based on the current maximum observed research effort from the literature, and these estimates should be viewed as relative, not absolute. The true size of the undiscovered mammalian virome will likely increase with new genetic tools for unbiased viral discovery and in depth studies that repeatedly sample wildlife populations over time 25 . Second, our ecological and biological predictor variables only explain a portion of the total variation in viral richness per host and zoonotic potential based on viral traits, although this is greater than that reported in comparable order-specific studies 10, 12 . Third, while we control for research effort we cannot account for viruses or host associations that have completely evaded human detection to date, nor those identified but not published. Additional resources to support better data-sharing and on-the-ground viral surveillance in the species and regions we identify would help validate predictive models to identify zoonotic viral hotspots, and streamline costly efforts to develop measures to prevent their future emergence.
 The analyses reported herein have broad potential to assist in expediting viral discovery programs for public health. Our host-specific analyses and estimates of 'missing zoonoses' allow us to identify which species and regions should be preferentially targeted to characterize the global mammalian virome. Our viral trait framework then allows prioritization of newly-discovered wildlife viruses for detailed characterization (e.g. by sequencing receptor binding domains, and conducting in vitro and in vivo infection experiments 23 ) to assess their potential to threaten human health.
 To construct the mammal-virus association database we initially extracted all viruses listed as occurring in any mammal from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses database (ICTVdb), and further individually went through each virus listed in the ICTV 8 th edition master list and searched the literature for mammalian hosts. All viral species names were synonymized to ICTV 8th edition, which was the global authority on viral taxonomy at the start of our data collection in 2010 16 . From 2010-15 the authors and a team of research assistants and interns at EcoHealth Alliance compiled mammal species associations for each of 586 unique viruses published in the literature between 1940-2015 initially by using the virus name and synonyms as the search keywords in the major online reference databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Google scholar) in addition to searching in books, reviews, and literature cited in sources we had already obtained. To narrow the search for hosts for well-researched viruses, we additionally included the terms ""host(s)"", ""reservoir"", ""wildlife"", ""animals"", ""surveillance"", and other relevant terms to find publications related to host range. Associations were cross-checked for completeness with the Global Mammal Parasite Database for primate, carnivore and ungulate viruses, version as of Nov 2006 (GMPD, www.mammalparasites.org) 30 and other published reviews specific to bats and rodents 12, 31, 32 . We excluded all records without species-level host information, and those where we could not track down the primary references. Records of mammal-virus associations from experimental infection studies, zoological parks or captive breeding facilities, or cell culture discoveries were excluded. Host species were defined as domestic vs. wild following the list of domestic animal species from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 33 , and we removed the black rat (Rattus rattus) and domestic mouse (Mus musculus) from the domesticated list as these two species make up their own ""peridomestic"" category. Host species were categorized as either occurring in human modified habitats or being hunted by humans -both estimates for human contact -according to the IUCN Red List species descriptions 34 .
 To control for the fact that some detection methods are more reliable than others in identifying the pathogen of interest, we recorded the detection method used for each host-virus association and scored these as 0, 1, or 2 according to the reliability of detection method used. Viral isolation and PCR detection with sequence confirmation were scored as a 2 (= stringent data); and serological methods were scored as a 0 or 1, with viral or serum neutralization tests (=1), and enzyme-linked immuno assays (ELISA), antigen detection assays, and other serological assays scored as (=0). 'Stringent data' were analyzed separately to remove potential uncertainty due to cross-reactivity with related viruses. We exhaustively searched the literature to identify a 'stringent' detection for each mammal-virus pair, and only included the serological finding for that pair if no molecular or viral isolation studies were available. We partitioned data and conducted separate analyses for the entire dataset (0 +1 + 2 detection quality) and the 'stringent' data (score of 2) to reduce the noise from potential serological cross-reactivity. Full list of host-virus associations, detection methods, and associated references are provided in our data and code repository at http:// doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.569079.
 Our operational definition of a zoonotic virus includes any virus that was detected in humans and at least one other mammalian host in at least one primary publication, and does not imply directionality. Our complete dataset of mammalian viral associations demonstrates evidence of past or current viral infection which we believe is a reasonable proxy for measuring spillover, and our 'stringent' dataset specifically is more robust to exclude species that may have been exposed to a given virus versus those that show some evidence for replication within the host species. Our bi-directional definition of spillover follows a proposal by the WHO that defines a zoonosis as ""any disease or infection that is naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans and vice-versa"" (http://www.who.int/ zoonoses/en/) and excludes any human pathogens that recently evolved from nonhuman pathogens (e.g. HIV in primates), as per Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005 1 .
 In order to address influence of transmission from humans to wildlife in our models, we also ran our GAM model fitting and selection procedure (see below) on a subset of data that excluded any probable 'reverse zoonotic' viruses. We first searched our entire dataset and removed any clear instances of transmission from humans to primates, e.g. including records from zoological parks and wildlife rehabilitation centers (as previously noted). We then additionally removed several human viruses most commonly transmitted from humans back to non-human primates to create a subset of data without the most common 'reverse zoonotic' viruses (Adeno-associated virus-2; Human adenovirus D; Human herpesvirus 4; Human metapneumovirus; Human respiratory syncytial virus; Measles virus; Mumps virus) 35, 36 . We present these additional analyses excluding 'reverse zoonoses' and associated code at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.569079.
 Total viral richness was calculated as the number of unique ICTV-recognized viruses found in a given host species, and zoonotic viral richness was defined as the number of unique ICTV-recognized viruses in a given host species that were also detected in humans in our database.
 To assess research bias for both host and virus, we searched ISI Web of Knowledge, including Web of Science and Zoological Record, and PubMed for the number of research publications for a given host or pathogen. We recorded two values for the number of research papers for a host. The first was a simple search by scientific binomial in Zoological Abstracts where we recorded the number of papers published between 1940-2013 for each host species. We also recorded the number of disease-related publications for each species using the scientific binomial AND topic keyword: disease* OR virus* OR pathogen* OR parasit*. The * operator was used in our search criteria to capture all words that begin with each term, e.g. ""parasit"" (= ""parasite"", ""parasites"", and ""parasitic""). These search criteria broadly included papers that examined disease or diseases, virus or viruses, pathogen or pathogens, parasite parasites, or parasitology, for each species. Only one measure of per host research effort was included at a time in model selection. As these metrics are highly correlated and the number of disease related citations per host outperformed the total number of publications per host in all but one model (all-data zoonoses), we decided to use disease-related publications as our per-species research effort measure for all models to improve interoperability. We also recorded the number of publications for each of 586 virus species using a keyword search by virus name in PubMed and Web of Science. Only one measure of per virus research effort was included at a time in model selection.
 We used a phylogenetically-corrected measure of body mass (see details below under 'Phylogenetic Signal') as our main life history predictor variable, because it was the only one for which a nearly complete data set existed for the species in our dataset. We used the body mass recorded in the PanTHERIA database 37 for 709 species. For 3 species, we used the second choice option, body mass recorded in the AnAge database 38 . For 11 species, we used the third choice option of the extrapolated body mass recorded in PanTHERIA, which is based on body length or forearm length, depending on species. For 36 species, we used the average body mass for members of the genus that had a recorded body mass. We explored other life-history variables related to longevity 39 , reproductive success, and basalmetabolic rate but these were ultimately excluded due to the high number of missing records.
 We address the issue of non-independence of host species traits due to shared ancestry 40 in our analyses by first quantifying the phylogenetic signal for each variable in our model using Blomberg's K 41 . Blomberg's K measures phylogenetic signal in a given trait by quantifying trait variance relative to an expectation under a Brownian motion null model of evolution using a phylogenetic tree with varying branch lengths. Blomberg's K-values are scaled from 0 to infinity, with a value of 0 equal to no phylogenetic signal and values greater than 1 equal to strong phylogenetic signal for closely related species that share more similar trait values. While there is no clearly defined K-value cut-off in which to apply phylogenetic comparative methods, non-significant value of <1, or more conservatively <0.5, are typical for traits that are phylogenetically independent. The only host variables we examined with significant K-values >0.5 were host body mass, and our direct measure of phylogenetic distance to humans. While there are several tools available to control for phylogeny in multivariate analyses, e.g. using phylogenetic generalized least square models (e.g. PGLS) 42 , there is currently no modeling approach to control for phylogeny using GAMs. More importantly, a wholesale effort to control for phylogeny across all variables in our analysis was not appropriate here, as we are explicitly testing the relative importance of phylogenetic distance to humans vs. other host traits including measures of human-wildlife contact to predict the proportion of zoonotic viruses for a given host species. This left body mass as the only variable in our models, excluding our direct measures of phylogenetic distance, with a significant Blomberg K value that was greater than one. We controlled for the significant effect of shared evolutionary history using a phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) 43,44 on body mass. The PVR approach allowed us to remove phylogenetic signal for any phylogenetically non-independent variables and then include the corrected values back in our GAMs, while retaining predictor variables like phylogenetic distance to humans as unmodified. We calculated PVR for body mass using the R package 'PVR' and our custom-build maximum likelihood host phylogeny using cytochrome B sequences constrained to the order-level topology of the mammalian supertree 29, 45 . Our new variable for body mass that controls for phylogenetic signal (PVRcytb_resid) removed most of the phylogenetic signal, with K= 3.5 unadjusted, and K<0.5 after PVR correction. Our new metric of body mass scales in the same way, with larger values equal to species with larger body mass. PVR body mass was included in our GAM model selection for the total viral richness and zoonotic virus models.
 We used two different mammal phylogenetic trees in our analyses and used a model selection framework to determine which best explained our observed association with zoonotic viral richness. First the mammal supertree was pruned in R (package ape, function 'drop.tips') to include only synonymous species for the 753 species in our database 29, 46 . We synonymized all host species names between the mammal supertree and the host associations in our database using the IUCN Red List 34 . If the species was listed as 'cattle' it was assumed to be Bos taurus, all other records were excluded if there was ambiguity as to the scientific name for the host species. Second, a maximum likelihood cytB tree was generated using the constraint of a multifurcating tree with taxa constrained to their respective orders and the order-level topology matching that of the mammal supertree 6 (CETARTIODACTYLA,PERISSODACTYLA) ,CARNIVORA),CHIROPTERA),EULIP OTYPHLA))))))). This generated a higher resolution species-level mammal tree using cytb data, with more reliable positioning of the higher-level taxonomic relationships than was obtained in exploratory phylogenetic analyses using cytb data alone. Genbank accession numbers and cytb sequence lengths for each species provided in in our data and code repository. Cytb gene fragments ranged from 143 to 1140bp, with >1000bp available for 558/665 (84%) of the taxa. Data derived from the cytochrome b tree constrained to the topology of the mammal supertree was selected as the best option in all best-fit GAMs.
 Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE with default setting in Geneious R6, and checked visually for errors 47 . The best maximum likelihood tree with and without the constraint tree were generated using RAxML-HPC2 on XSEDE via the CIPRES Science Gateway server v3.1 48 using a GTR model with parsimony seed, 1000 bootstrap replicates, and the following, specific parameters (raxmlHPC-HYBRID -s infile -n result -x 12345 -g constraint.tre -N 1000 -c 25 -p 12345 -f a -m GTRCAT).
 Matrices of pairwise patristic distances between all species, including Homo sapiens, were calculated from the two phylogenies using the 'cophenetic' function in the R package ape 46 .
 Phylogenetic trees (Newick format for pruned Supertree and cytb tree) and matrices of phylogenetic distance from humans are provided in the data and code repository.
 We calculated mean, median, max, min, IQR, and standard deviation (represented as generic function F in equation 1) of phylogenetic host breadth (PHB) from all known mammalian hosts for each virus using the pairwise patristic distances (d i,j ) for each mammal-mammal association for all hosts of a given virus excluding humans, where i indexes each mammal in the database, as does j, and J represents the total mammals in the database. We aggregated these PHB values using mean, median, or maximum values at a viral species, genus and viral family level to generate higher-level taxonomic variables of host breadth per viral group. Our measure is similar to those developed by previous studies to understand parasite host specificity [49] [50] [51] , but here we create a generalizable variable to measure viral host breadth that can be aggregated at different viral taxonomic levels.

 To make Extended Data Figure 9 , taxon names and terminal branches of cytb tree constrained to supertree were color-coded using residual from the best-fit zoonotic virus GAM (predicted-observed zoonotic viral richness) for wildlife species, and plotted using the plot.phylo function in the R package ape 46 . Symbols (circles) at terminal taxa additionally added to better visualize residual value colors were added using willeerd.nodelabels function (dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10855). All marine mammals, domestic animals, and other taxa with missing data were coded as grey for missing data. Viral richness heatmap (Extended Data Figure 2 ) was generated using the R package pheatmap, and the 'complete' hierarchical clustering algorithm to sort cells across rows and columns by similar values of viral richness. All boxplots, histograms and all other figures generated in R v.3.3.0 52 . R code for primary figure generation is provided in the code repository.
 We fit a set of generalized additive models (GAMs) that included all of our selected potential variables explaining the number of total viruses or number of zoonoses in hosts, as well as whether viruses were zoonotic (for conceptual framework and summary of each GAM see Extended Data Figure 1 ; for full variable list and data sources see Supplementary  Table 1 ). Our use of GAMs, an incorporation of smooth spline predictor functions into the generalized linear model (GLM) framework, allowed us to examine the functional form of our predictor variables (e.g. Fig 2 and 4) . Categorical and binary variables (e.g. host order, IUCN status of hunted or not, and certain viral traits) were fit as random effects of each variable level. We used automated term selection by double penalty smoothing 53 to eliminate variables from the models. This method removes variables with little to no predictive power and has been shown to be comparable or superior to comparing alternate models with and without variables. We did use the model comparison method in for the case of domestic animals, where the sample size was not sufficient for fitting all variables. In this case dropping variables by double penalty smoothing still allowed pruning the model list to eliminate redundant models. Where there were competing variables measuring the same mechanistic effect, we fit alternate GAMs using only one of each of these variables (as specified in below and in the Extended Data Figure 1 ). These included phylogenetic variables, citation counts from alternate databases, and different measures of human population/host overlap. For example, to capture host phylogeny we used phylogenetic distance based on either the mammal supertree 20 or a purpose-built CytB constrained by the topology of the mammal supertree, but never both in the same model. For human population variables, we looked at either variables measuring overlap of species range with humanoccupied areas, or human population in those areas, as area-and population-based measures were highly co-linear. For citation variables, we looked at either all citations or the number of disease-related citations for each host species, not both, and similarly citations in either PubMed or Web of Knowledge. We used a binomial GAM to analyze the 586 mammalian viruses in our database and identify viral traits that may serve as predictors of zoonotic potential. Collinearity was not a major issue among variables included in the same model.
 We inspected models within 2 AIC units of the model with the lowest AIC, and present the outputs of the best-fit and all other top models (<2 ΔAIC) in our data and code repository. In general, variable effects retained the same functional form and effect size across models within 2 ΔAIC -differences were limited to the adding or dropping of very weak, insignificant effects, or switching between highly correlated competing variables such as citation counts from different databases.
 For our model of number of zoonoses per host, we used the total number of observed viruses per host as an offset, effectively fitting a model of expected number of zoonoses per host virus. We found this variable had a coefficient near to one when it was used as a linear predictor, indicating its appropriateness as an offset. We repeated the model selection process for all models using the more 'stringent' set of data that used only virus identified in mammal hosts using viral isolation, PCR, or other methods of nucleic acid sequence confirmation, i.e. that excluded all associations detected via serology.
 All models were fit using the MGCV package for R (version 1. 8-12.) . We used the model with the lowest AIC to predict the number of expected zoonotic viruses for each host species, using all the data from our database that had complete observations for the best model. Our top models consistently outperform the alternatives by wide margins, as measured by AIC. We used standard methods in the R package MGCV to calculate deviance explained, which is defined as (D_null -D_model)/D_null. In this formula, D_null is the deviance (−2*likelihood) of an intercept-only, (or, in the case of the zoonoses model, offsetonly), model, while D_model is the deviance of our best-fit model.
 Analyses were limited to terrestrial mammal species as defined by the IUCN Red List (marine mammals were excluded) and we ran separate analyses for wild and domestic animals. As domestic animals made up a much smaller data set (n=32 species) with a unique set of explanatory variables that differed from the wild species analyses, these models were fit separately. Domestic species results are also discussed separately (see Supplementary Discussion) as they are tangential to the primary findings.
 We used k-fold cross-validation to evaluate goodness of fit for all models. The data was divided into 10 folds, selected randomly. For each fold, the model was re-fit based on the other 9 folds, and goodness of fit was assessed by conducting a nonparametric permutation test of comparing the predicted values vs. the real values for the k th fold, where a nonsignificant result indicates that predictions are unbiased. Poisson models goodness-of-fit may be compared via a parametric Chi-squared permutation test on deviance values, but this test is inappropriate in the case of models with low mean values, as is our case for some of our GAMs 54 . The k-fold cross-validation confirmed the robustness of our model predictions for wild mammals, code and outputs from these tests for each best-fit GAM are provided in Supplementary Table 2.
 In addition to randomly-selected k-fold cross-validation, we evaluated the robustness of our models via a non-random geographic cross-validation, code and summary document provided in our code and data repository. In order to meaningfully organize species in our dataset by geographic areas, we used the 34 zoogeographic regions for terrestrial mammals recently redefined by Holt et al. 55 . Using QGIS 56 , a mammal-specific zoogeographical shapefile provided by Holt's group at the University of Copenhagen (http:// macroecology.ku.dk/resources/wallace) was intersected (using QGIS Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Intersect) with a shapefile of IUCN's host ranges for all mammals in our database. Areas of these intersections were then calculated using an equal-area projection (Mollweide), and each host was assigned to only the region that contained the greatest proportion of its range. We systematically removed all observations (species) from each given zoogeographical region, re-fit the model using all observations from outside the region, then performed a non-parametric permutation test comparing the predicted values to the observed values for that region. Non-significant results indicate that model predictions are unbiased. Significant results for a given zoogeographic region suggest that there are location-specific biases that remain unexplained. This systematic zoogeographic crossvalidation supported the overall robustness of our model predictions for several models, i.e. all-data zoonoses, all-data total viral richness, and stringent-data total viral richness models. For these models, even though a majority of zoogeographic regions were unbiased, we still identified several zoogeographic regions that showed significant bias. Our zoogeographic cross-validation was equivocal for the stringent-data zoonoses model, with 8 regions that showed evidence of bias and 7 regions which showed no evidence of bias (Supplementary Table 3 ).
 The presence of biased regions in our zoogeographic cross-validation suggested the possibility that there is a systematic bias associated with geography not captured by the Olival predictor variables in our models. To further investigate this, we added zoogeographical region as a categorical random effect to each of our best-fit models. For three of our best-fit GAMs (all-data total viruses, stringent-data total viruses, and stringent-data zoonoses) the addition of zoogeographical region as a categorical random effect decreased the model AIC and increased the total deviance explained by 3-5%. The all-data zoonoses model, which was used to create the series of maps in the main manuscript, does not improve with the inclusion of zoogeographical region. However, the improved predictive power of models using region-specific terms is offset by the increase in degrees of freedom (i.e. if we included 31 zoogeographic regions as separate terms) and, more importantly, a decreased interpretability of our models -especially when compared to the geographical variables we used, such as host area or species range overlap with human modified habitat. We opted not to include these random effects in our final GAMs in favor of keeping only variables interpretable in the context of our host trait-specific framework. Instead, we indicate areas of geographic bias directly on our spatially mapped outputs. (See ""Calculating and visualizing 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses'"", below.) Summaries of these models, along with changes in relative deviance explained for the other explanatory variables when zoogeographic region is added as a random effect, are provided in our code and data repository.
 For all the wildlife hosts we used the geographic range information obtained from the IUCN spatial database version 2015.2. Wildlife host species shapefiles needed to replicate analysis are now hosted on our Amazon S3 storage (https://s3.amazonaws.com/hp3-shapefiles/ Mammals_Terrestrial.zip) 34 . IUCN depict species' range distributions as polygons based on the extent of occurrence (EOO), which is defined as the area contained within a minimum convex hull around species' observations or records. This convex hull or polygon is further improved by including areas known to be suitable or by removing unsuitable or unoccupied areas based on expert knowledge. To accurately calculate the area in km 2 of each host species we projected the polygons to an equal area projection (Mollweide).
 We calculated various thresholds of mammal sympatry based on percentage of range overlap for each wild species in our database using IUCN shape files for all mammals globally. We define mammal sympatry as the number of mammalian species that overlap with the target species' geographic range. We calculated mammal sympatry for each wild species in our database at six different thresholds based on the percentage area overlap with the target species geographic range, i.e. the number of other wild mammal species with any (>0%), ≥20%, ≥40%, ≥50%, ≥80%, or 100% range overlap. The six different thresholds for mammal sympatry were included as competing terms in our model selection for the total viral richness models.
 We derived and tested several global measures to estimate the level of human contact with each wild species in our database. To estimate the area of host geographic range covered by crops, pastures, rural and urban areas -as measures of global human contact with a given wildlife species -each species polygon was intersected (overlapped) with spatial data representing those land cover types. Additionally, we calculated the total number of people within each host geographic range using data from HYDE database 57 , and also separately totaled the number of people in rural and urban populations. We obtained data on the distribution of cropland, pastures, rural and urban areas (i.e., grazing land) also from the HYDE database 57 for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2005 with a spatial resolution of 5' × 5', equivalent to 10km 2 by 10km 2 . These datasets were created by combining information from satellite imagery and sub-national crop and pasture statistics 57 . In our GAMs, we used several transformations of these variables as competing proxies for humanwildlife contact: the log-transformed area of host range that overlapped each type of humanmodified land cover, log-transformed human population in the host range, log-transformed human population density in the host range, and the log-ratio of urban and rural human populations in the host range. For each of these, we also included as a variable the change in value from 1970 to 2005. Human-wildlife contact variables that significantly covaried were excluded (set as competing terms) during the model selection process. The ratio of urban to rural human population was used to disentangle variables of human-wildlife contact that significantly covaried. For example, the total area of a species range that overlapped with urban and rural areas was highly correlated with the total geographic area variables we examined (e.g. total area, and area in crop, pasture, rural, and urban). The ratio of urban to rural population allowed us to separate these signals and best represent this proxy of per species human-wildlife contact. All spatial analyses were performed in R (3.3.2) 52 , using the following R libraries: raster 58 , rgdal 59 , and sp 59 .
 We used each respective best-fit, all data GAM from the total viral richness and proportion zoonoses models to calculate the estimated number of viruses that would be observed if the research effort variable for each species was equal to that of the most-studied wild species in our database (Vulpes vulpes with 4,433 total publications and 1,477 disease-related publications). We used the prediction of the total virus richness GAM as the offset for the zoonoses GAM. We then calculated the 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' by subtracting the observed number of viruses and zoonoses from the predictions based on maximum research for each wild mammalian species.
 We used geographic range maps from the IUCN spatial database (2015.2) to visualize the spatial distribution of observed host-virus associations, observed host-zoonoses association, these associations as predicted under maximum research, and the maximum predictedobserved viruses, or the 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' (e.g. Table 4 ). We also generated maps comparing species richness of all species in the IUCN database against those with viral associations in our database. For each species, the distribution range was converted to a grid system with cells 1/6 of a geographic degree (approximately 18 km × 18 km at the Equator line). Each grid cell was assigned a value of one to indicate presence. We repeated this process and assigned the observed and predicted-under-max-effort number of zoonotic viruses to their correspondent grid cells. Viral and host species richness maps, and both the 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' maps were calculated by overlying individual grids. Each richness map represents the sum of all values for a given grid cell. We repeated the process for all the host species in our database and created viral and species richness maps for the following orders: Carnivora, Cetartiodactyla, Chiroptera, Primates and Rodentia. These taxa were selected because they represent 681/736 (92.5%) of wild mammal species in our database.
 In the process of translating our non-spatial, species-level predictions to geographic space (i.e. layered raster maps), we identified several geographic areas where our model predictions of the number of total and zoonotic viruses were systematically biased, i.e. pvalue <0.05 (Supplementary Table 3 ). In order to visualize the geographic biases of our nonspatial model predictions in our maps (see above regarding zoogeographic cross-validation), we demarcate regions with significant bias with hatching. Hatched regions represent areas where model predictions of total or zoonotic viral richness deviate systematically for the collection of species in that grid cell. For each grid cell we calculated whether the bias exceeded that expected from a random sampling of hosts. This was accomplished by summing the residuals from 100,000 random draws of species in our dataset that was equal to the number of species present in that grid cell, then identifying grid cells where the observed bias was outside the middle 95% of the randomly drawn distribution. We calculated this for all mammals, and separately for each order across all grid cells. Areas with observed bias (outside of 95% of the randomly drawn distribution) are shown with hatched regions on each 'missing virus' and 'missing zoonoses' map.
 Animal silhouettes added to associations. Significant variables from each best-fit GAM are noted with an *. Zoonotic viral spillover firstly depends on the underlying total viral richness in mammal populations and the ecological, taxonomic, and life-history traits that govern this diversity (GAM 1). Secondly, host and virus specific factors may facilitate viral spillover. We examine the relative importance of host phylogenetic distance to humans, ecological opportunity for contact, or other species-specific life-history and taxonomic traits (GAM 2), and identify viral traits associated with a higher likelihood of an observed virus being zoonotic (GAM 3). We estimate the total and zoonotic viral richness per host species using GAMs 1 and 2, and calculate the 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' under a scenario of increased research effort (b, Methods). Due to imperfect surveillance in both humans and wildlife and biases in viral detection, there may be uncertainty in the exact proportion of viruses that are zoonotic (b, light grey), and also between the actual, or true, viral richness (dotted lines) and the predicted maximum viral richness per host (dashed line). a, Observed total viral richness (for n = 178 host spp.); b, predicted total viral richness given maximum research effort; c, 'missing viruses' or predicted -observed total viral richness; d, observed zoonotic viral richness (n=183); e, predicted zoonotic viral richness given maximum research effort; f, 'missing zoonoses' or predicted -observed zoonotic viral richness (same as included in Fig 3f) Extended Data Table 1 Summary of best-fit generalized additive models (GAMs) for total and zoonotic viral richness per wild mammal species, and probability of a virus being zoonotic Models were selected separately using the entire dataset and a 'stringent' dataset that excluded host-virus associations detected by serology.

Here we create then analyze a database of 2,805 mammal-virus associations, including 754 mammal species (14% of global mammal diversity) from 15 orders and 586 unique viral species (every recognized virus found in mammals 16 ) from 28 viral families (Methods). We use these data to test hypotheses on the determinants of viral richness and viral sharing with humans. Second, we identify and rank the ecological, phylogenetic, and life-history traits that make some species more likely hosts of zoonoses than others. Several domestic ungulate species (orders Cetartiodactyla and Perissodactyla) are outliers for their number of observed viruses, but these species have a relatively low proportion of zoonotic viruses ( Fig. However, these studies weight all species equally. We hypothesize that the number of viruses a given mammal species shares with humans decreases with phylogenetic distance from humans and increases with opportunity for human contact. Host geographic range was also significantly associated with increasing total viral richness, although the strength of this effect was low (Fig. Our best model to predict the number of zoonotic viruses per wild mammal species explained 82% of the deviance, and included phylogenetic distance from humans, a ratio of urban to rural human population across a species range, host order, whether or not a species is hunted, research effort, and total viral richness (Extended Data Table 1) . 2g ) that may represent an artifact of preferentially screening marsupials for human viruses. 2i ) -suggesting that continuous variation in phylogenetic distance across primate species is more important, and is significant even when all mammals are included. A single global metric of human-wildlife ecological contact did not emerge across models. Overall, the strength of the effect of phylogenetic distance was stronger than our proxies for animal-human contact in predicting proportion of zoonoses (30-44% stronger explanatory factor), but both remained significant after controlling for research effort (Extended Data Table 1 ). We then project these 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' geographically ( Fig. Geographic hotspots of 'missing zoonoses' vary by host taxonomic order, with foci for carnivores and even-toed ungulates in Eastern and Southern Africa, bats in South and Central America and parts of Asia, primates in specific tropical regions in Central America, Africa, and Southeast Asia; and rodents in pockets of North and South America and Central Africa. Areas where 'missing zoonoses' predictions were systematically biased varied by taxonomic order, but included large parts of Africa for the all mammal dataset (Fig. We acknowledge several important caveats. Third, while we control for research effort we cannot account for viruses or host associations that have completely evaded human detection to date, nor those identified but not published. The analyses reported herein have broad potential to assist in expediting viral discovery programs for public health. To narrow the search for hosts for well-researched viruses, we additionally included the terms ""host(s)"", ""reservoir"", ""wildlife"", ""animals"", ""surveillance"", and other relevant terms to find publications related to host range. Stringent data' were analyzed separately to remove potential uncertainty due to cross-reactivity with related viruses. In order to address influence of transmission from humans to wildlife in our models, we also ran our GAM model fitting and selection procedure (see below) on a subset of data that excluded any probable 'reverse zoonotic' viruses. We present these additional analyses excluding 'reverse zoonoses' and associated code at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.569079. We recorded two values for the number of research papers for a host. Only one measure of per host research effort was included at a time in model selection. We used the body mass recorded in the PanTHERIA database 37 for 709 species. For 3 species, we used the second choice option, body mass recorded in the AnAge database 38 . More importantly, a wholesale effort to control for phylogeny across all variables in our analysis was not appropriate here, as we are explicitly testing the relative importance of phylogenetic distance to humans vs. other host traits including measures of human-wildlife contact to predict the proportion of zoonotic viruses for a given host species. This left body mass as the only variable in our models, excluding our direct measures of phylogenetic distance, with a significant Blomberg K value that was greater than one. PVR body mass was included in our GAM model selection for the total viral richness and zoonotic virus models. Cytb gene fragments ranged from 143 to 1140bp, with >1000bp available for 558/665 (84%) of the taxa. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE with default setting in Geneious R6, and checked visually for errors 47 . Matrices of pairwise patristic distances between all species, including Homo sapiens, were calculated from the two phylogenies using the 'cophenetic' function in the R package ape 46 . We aggregated these PHB values using mean, median, or maximum values at a viral species, genus and viral family level to generate higher-level taxonomic variables of host breadth per viral group. Symbols (circles) at terminal taxa additionally added to better visualize residual value colors were added using willeerd.nodelabels function (dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10855). All marine mammals, domestic animals, and other taxa with missing data were coded as grey for missing data. R code for primary figure generation is provided in the code repository. We used automated term selection by double penalty smoothing 53 to eliminate variables from the models. In this case dropping variables by double penalty smoothing still allowed pruning the model list to eliminate redundant models. For human population variables, we looked at either variables measuring overlap of species range with humanoccupied areas, or human population in those areas, as area-and population-based measures were highly co-linear. We used a binomial GAM to analyze the 586 mammalian viruses in our database and identify viral traits that may serve as predictors of zoonotic potential. We inspected models within 2 AIC units of the model with the lowest AIC, and present the outputs of the best-fit and all other top models (<2 ΔAIC) in our data and code repository. We found this variable had a coefficient near to one when it was used as a linear predictor, indicating its appropriateness as an offset. Our top models consistently outperform the alternatives by wide margins, as measured by AIC. We used k-fold cross-validation to evaluate goodness of fit for all models. The data was divided into 10 folds, selected randomly. Using QGIS 56 , a mammal-specific zoogeographical shapefile provided by Holt's group at the University of Copenhagen (http:// macroecology.ku.dk/resources/wallace) was intersected (using QGIS Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Intersect) with a shapefile of IUCN's host ranges for all mammals in our database. Non-significant results indicate that model predictions are unbiased. The presence of biased regions in our zoogeographic cross-validation suggested the possibility that there is a systematic bias associated with geography not captured by the Olival predictor variables in our models. The all-data zoonoses model, which was used to create the series of maps in the main manuscript, does not improve with the inclusion of zoogeographical region. However, the improved predictive power of models using region-specific terms is offset by the increase in degrees of freedom (i.e. if we included 31 zoogeographic regions as separate terms) and, more importantly, a decreased interpretability of our models -especially when compared to the geographical variables we used, such as host area or species range overlap with human modified habitat. Instead, we indicate areas of geographic bias directly on our spatially mapped outputs. ( See ""Calculating and visualizing 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses'"", below.) The ratio of urban to rural population allowed us to separate these signals and best represent this proxy of per species human-wildlife contact. We used geographic range maps from the IUCN spatial database (2015.2) to visualize the spatial distribution of observed host-virus associations, observed host-zoonoses association, these associations as predicted under maximum research, and the maximum predictedobserved viruses, or the 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' (e.g. Table 4 ).

1,1,2c98d60bdb03ef4b0cc7c08bddb0e6947ab7cac9,,Engineering H5N1 avian influenza viruses to study human adaptation,"Two studies of H5N1 avian influenza viruses that had been genetically engineered to render them transmissible between ferrets have proved highly controversial. Divergent opinions exist about the importance of these studies of influenza transmission and about potential 'dual use' research implications. No consensus has developed yet about how to balance these concerns. After not recommending immediate full publication of earlier, less complete versions of the studies, the United States National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity subsequently recommended full publication of more complete manuscripts; however, controversy about this and similar research remains.","Knowledgeable observers operating within a legitimate framework for the public good have expressed divergent opinions about the importance and public safety implications of two papers, one recently published 1 and one soon-to-be published 2 , describing the production of ferret-transmissible H5N1 influenza viruses, and about related influenza transmission and pathogenesis research [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Some have emphasized that understanding the underlying principles of influenza virus host adaptation and transmission can lead to better prevention and control of viruses that arise naturally, whereas others have drawn attention to 'dual use' implications-that is, bioterrorism-or to accidental release of potentially deadly viruses. The most commonly mentioned public safety concerns relate to three assumptions: (1) H5N1 viruses are currently highly lethal to humans but are poorly transmissible; (2) genetic manipulation of H5N1 viruses to increase transmissibility in mammals such as ferrets will create variant viruses that remain highly pathogenic and that become transmissible in humans; and (3) if accidentally or intentionally released, such a virus could precipitate a historically severe influenza pandemic. How do these assumptions hold up against scientific data? In this perspective, we address research evidence related to the epidemic/pandemic potential of genetically engineered H5N1 viruses, and discuss limitations in understanding how influenza viruses become pathogenic, transmissible and potentially pandemic in humans.
 Influenza is among the leading global infectious causes of death, periodically causing pandemics that can kill millions of people. Countless influenza A viruses circulate globally in a reservoir that consists of hundreds of avian species. Rarely, one of these viruses undergoes changes that enable it to switch hosts to infect mammals, including humans, although it is not clear whether human transmission can result directly from adaptation of an avian influenza virus (this has not been documented to occur), or only indirectly via further adaptation of pre-existing human or mammalian-adapted viruses, the mechanism that has been associated with all known pandemic and seasonal viruses after 1918. The factors underlying all such emergences are poorly understood 8 . In the past 80 years of influenza virology, three pandemics have resulted from reassortments of pre-existing human-adapted or mammalian-adapted viruses with one or more avian-influenza-derived genes, but no purely avian influenza virus has emerged to cause a pandemic or human outbreak, or has even become stably adapted to humans. However, because avian influenza viruses have adapted to other mammals, it is considered plausible that such an emergence could occur in humans.
 Among many other important research areas related to influenza, it is therefore critical to study the mechanisms by which influenza viruses emerge from birds to become adapted to mammals and ultimately humans, and to learn how the phenotypic properties of such evolving viruses may be associated with human transmission and disease. Among the many subtypes and strains of avian influenza A viruses that exist in nature, those that have at least occasionally infected mammals (for example, H5N1, H7N7 and H9N2) are of interest because they might theoretically be more likely than other influenza A viruses to adapt directly or indirectly to humans. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have been of particular interest with respect to theoretical pandemic potential because they have been unusually pathogenic in domestic poultry and have infected and killed several hundred people over a 15-year period.
 In seeking to understand such influenza viruses, a research approach used widely in virology is to engineer specific genetic mutations into naturally occurring viruses, and then study the resulting viral phenotypic properties in animals, including infectivity, cell tropism, viral replication, pathogenicity and transmissibility. These types of experiments can potentially provide clues about whether and how a virus might adapt to humans, and what prevention and control options might be useful if that virus did emerge. Much H5N1 research of this type has already been published, including viral genetic engineering to evaluate properties such as pathogenicity and transmissibility in ferrets and other animal models. In the context of this published research literature, we comment on questions relevant to the two papers under discussion 1,2 .
 The ongoing HPAI H5N1 enzootic continues to cause 'spill-over' human infections. World Health Organization (WHO) data indicate that since 2003, HPAI H5N1 viruses have infected 603 people and killed 356 (ref. 9). Technically, the term 'highly pathogenic' refers only to the effects of certain H5 and H7 influenza viruses in poultry, not in humans or other mammals; most such viruses either cannot infect, or are relatively harmless in, humans. HPAI H5 and H7 phenotypes are both associated with mutations in the haemagglutinin (HA) gene that usually result from insertion of a sequence of codons encoding multiple basic amino acids at the location where the two linked protein domains comprising the mature HA are cleaved during infection 10 . This cleavage site change leads to disseminated viral replication in multiple organs of avian species, resulting in high mortality. However, in humans, who cannot be easily infected with most low pathogenicity or HPAI viruses, if they can be infected at all, efficient replication outside the respiratory tract generally does not occur. Therefore, despite the current unusual situation with H5N1 viruses in humans since 2003 (see below), neither H5N1 nor other HPAI viruses would necessarily replicate systemically or cause extreme pathogenicity should human adaptation occur. Although the basis of HPAI H5N1 viral pathogenicity in severe and fatal human cases remains unknown, there is no evidence suggesting that it results from changes known to be associated with viral adaptation to gallinaceous poultry; in fact, no human-adapted or pandemic influenza virus contains genetic changes indicative of prior poultry adaptation.
 Solely on the basis of publicly available information about pathogenicity of intranasally inoculated H5N1 virus (the model for natural human and animal infection), the laboratoryderived H5N1 viruses produced in the two papers under discussion 1,11-15 do not have enhanced pathogenicity in ferrets compared to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, which is considered to be mildly pathogenic for humans 14, 15 . An apparent misconception has nevertheless arisen in recent public discussions of these studies, namely that the engineered, ferret-transmissible H5N1 viruses were extremely pathogenic in ferrets after intranasal inoculation or aerosol transmission. This notion seems to have resulted in part from misunderstandings about a technique-intratracheal inoculation-used in a separate substudy reported in the manuscript by the Fouchier group 14,15 , a method that is not directly relevant to viral transmissibility or natural pathogenesis. As documented since the 1940s 16 , intratracheal inoculation of influenza viruses is not a 'model' for natural viral pathogenicity; influenza viruses that are otherwise considered to be of low pathogenicity often induce severe and even fatal disease in animals when administered by this route, including the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus 15 . The presentation of transmissibility studies alongside high-dose intratracheal inoculation pathogenesis studies in the Fouchier manuscript seems to have suggested (incorrectly) to some that the engineered transmissible H5N1 virus is deadly after intranasal inoculation or aerosol transmission between ferrets and, by extension, might be both transmissible and deadly for humans, that is, a virus of deadly pandemic potential. No evidence has yet been presented to support this, although the possibility that additional unspecified genetic changes might do so cannot be excluded.
 It is questionable to what extent HPAI H5N1 is adapted to, or capable of adapting to, humans. It is not clear why one evolving lineage of avian HPAI H5N1 viruses, out of a large and genetically divergent pool of H5 and other avian influenza viruses that rarely infect humans (much less cause severe human disease), has recently infected hundreds or perhaps thousands of people. It may be that the human cases are a result of unusual high-dose exposures or rare individual genetic susceptibilities. Alternatively, H5N1 viruses may be beginning to do something no other HPAI virus has ever been documented to do-adapt directly to humans. And if H5N1 did adapt, could it cause a pandemic?
 No HPAI virus in the historic record has ever been efficiently transmitted between humans, let alone caused a pandemic. Even when avian influenza virus genes have been imported by reassortment into existing human influenza viruses, as happened for example in 1957 with H2N2 influenza and in 1968 with H3N2 influenza, the sources seem to have been circulating low-pathogenicity avian viruses, not poultry-adapted viruses such as HPAI viruses 10 . Conceivably, the considerable host-switching mutations associated with adaptation of wild bird viruses to gallinaceous poultry, or at least of wild viruses to HPAI poultry viruses, represent an evolutionary pathway divergent from those pathways associated with mammalian adaptation, seemingly presenting an additional challenge for poultry-adapted influenza viruses to achieve efficient mammalian adaptation 17 . After 15 years of highdensity enzootic circulation in domestic poultry around the world, no human-adapted H5N1 virus has emerged from a natural reservoir, suggesting the existence of unknown biological barriers.
 Despite circulation of influenza A viruses of 16 HA subtypes in billions of birds over a very long time span, the four pandemics in the last century have been restricted to influenza viruses bearing HA subtypes H1, H2 or H3. Decades ago, many experts predicted that influenza pandemics could be explained by 'recycling' of a small number of HAs in new human generations; more recently, this belief has been expanded to posit that the other HA subtypes (including H5) are fundamentally incapable of adapting to humans, being selected against by biological constraints or unappreciated selection pressures [18] [19] [20] . Despite widespread influenza virus circulation and dynamic evolution at the human-animal interface, with many billions of quasispecies, mutations and gene constellations circulating, only four influenza pandemics have occurred in the last century, and in the three of those with a known viral origin the viruses resulted from reassortment of pre-existing human or swine viruses 21 , not by mutation or adaptation of existing avian viruses. This suggests that de novo emergence of a human pandemic influenza virus is an extremely rare event that is not easily achieved in nature 10 , and presumably would not be easily achieved by engineering a small number of laboratory mutations. As some of the key engineered H5N1 mutations in the two studies occur spontaneously during normal laboratory passage 22 , or have been found singly or in combination in natural H5N1 and in other influenza viruses [23] [24] [25] [26] , including strains from wild birds, it remains unclear whether or how the engineered viruses in question create or increase the risk of a pandemic.
 Serial passage of a virus in intact animals or in tissues derived from a particular species often results in enhanced species-specific virulence, which can be applied to establish an animal model with measurable morbidity and/or mortality outcomes useful for evaluating antiviral therapeutics, passive immunization and vaccines. Influenza viruses, SARS coronavirus and Ebola virus have all been passaged in mice to enhance virulence; the resulting host-adapted viruses have been studied biologically and used to evaluate strategies for control and prevention. However, adaptational mutations resulting from serial passage tend to be host-specific and may not produce the same outcomes in other species. For example, the classical swine influenza virus, A/swine/Iowa/1930 (H1N1), is very pathogenic in ferrets and mice but poses no threat to humans 27 . Another example is mouse-adapted Ebola virus, which is lethal for mice and guinea pigs but attenuated for nonhuman primates 28, 29 . Ferrets are susceptible to a wide range of viruses including influenza viruses, SARS coronavirus, canine distemper virus and some parvoviruses, many of which do not infect humans or other mammals. A number of influenza viruses that replicate efficiently in ferrets 30-33 seem poorly able, or unable, to infect humans, even after experimental challenge 34 . Thus, pathogenicity and transmissibility of any influenza virus in ferrets cannot be used directly to predict what type and severity of disease the same virus might produce in humans and human populations.
 It is unclear whether genetic manipulation of an H5N1 virus to achieve transmissibility in a particular mammal such as a ferret can predict human transmissibility. Because natural history and viral challenge studies cannot always be performed in humans, they have been conducted in experimental animals including mice, guinea pigs, ferrets, non-human primates and various other mammals. Unfortunately, there is no perfect animal model capable of reproducing all of the important variables involved in human influenza infection, although each animal model may be useful in understanding some aspect of influenza biology. Unlike most other mammals, ferrets generally can be infected with many or most avian, mammalian and human influenza viruses without prior viral adaptation, and often transmit efficiently between them 35 , providing useful general information about the viral genetic basis of phenotypic properties such as infectivity, pathogenicity, transmissibility and immune responses 35 , even though the findings cannot necessarily be directly applied to human infections [36] [37] [38] . Furthermore, in decades of research, using a large number of different avian and mammalian influenza viruses, severe or fatal disease has not often been observed in ferrets following intranasal inoculation or aerosol exposure.
 These useful traits of easy infectability and mildly symptomatic infection have rendered the ferret a 'permissive' influenza model. Specifically, many naturally occurring influenza viruses that infect, and often transmit between, ferrets are not known to infect people or cause human disease 27, [30] [31] [32] [33] 39, 40 . Ferrets are thus an imperfect model for predicting human infectivity or transmissibility, let alone the high level of transmissibility characteristic of pandemic spread. On the basis of public presentations by the senior authors of the two studies in question, neither of the engineered H5N1 viruses was as efficiently transmissible in ferrets as the human-adapted 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus 14, 15 . Phenotypic properties such as replication, pathogenicity and transmissibility are likely to be polygenic traits driven by mutations that are independent and possibly competing 10, 41 . Transmissibility is a complex phenotype that probably requires cooperative changes in more than one gene segment, and these may differ greatly between different viruses that become transmissible. Mutations that confer transmissibility in a ferret may be species-specific and irrelevant to other hosts 42 . There are probably multiple unique virus-specific pathways to transmissibility for particular viruses infecting particular hosts 43 . For example, transmissibility of the 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus has been linked to changes in the genes encoding HA and PB2 proteins 36, 37 , whereas transmissibility of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, which has a closely related HA, has been linked to gene segments encoding the neuraminidase and matrix proteins 44 .
 Moreover, because determinants of viral pathogenicity may be lost upon adaptation to a new host, H5N1 viruses, whether or not transmissible, do not always cause severe disease in ferrets or non-human primates [45] [46] [47] . For these reasons viral phenotypes observed in animal models like the ferret may not predict what would happen in humans. Indeed, given that many influenza viruses that are non-pathogenic for humans easily transmit and may cause illness in ferrets, the 'ferret model' does not reliably predict human transmissibility or pathogenicity, although the model remains valuable for understanding the principles and dynamics of infection.
 In addition to data from experiments in mammals, it is noteworthy that of the many mammalian-adapted influenza viruses that infect and transmit explosively among pigs, among horses and among dogs, few infect humans and none are transmitted between them 48 . Although swine influenza viruses caused sporadic human infections before 2009 49, 50 , and caused the 2009 H1N1 pandemic 21 , outbreaks associated with human influenza viruses are rare in pigs. It is even conceivable that H5N1 viruses have already become adapted to mammals without causing severe disease or onward transmission to humans. Evidence from China's Qinghai Lake, for example, shows 13.4% H5N1 seropositivity and 3.4% active infection in apparently healthy, live-caught rodents called pikas 51 . Clearly, adaptation of an influenza virus to a specific mammalian host does not necessarily predict its infectiousness, pathogenicity or transmissibility in other mammals, even though valuable insights into mechanisms of disease, host responses, and prevention and treatment may be obtained by studying these particular animals. Such insights can provide valuable clues in designing countermeasures against deadly epidemics and pandemics.
 Belief that an H5N1 virus could produce a 59% pandemic case-fatality rate is the most frightening aspect of the current controversy surrounding aerosol transmission of H5N1 virus in ferrets. In 500 years of observation, no influenza pandemic is believed to have caused a case-fatality rate over about 2% (ref. 52); pandemic and seasonal circulation of H1, H2 and H3 influenza viruses over the past century have all produced lower overall mortality rates 53 . The widely cited 59% figure is not a mortality rate but a case-fatality rate computed from cumulative cases reported to WHO since 2003 9 . (Case fatality refers to fatal cases divided by all fatal plus non-fatal cases combined.) By general consensus, the WHO figure probably overestimates actual mortality. Among other concerns common to epidemiological data, the WHO case definition 54 features diagnostic severity criteria (evidence of an acute pneumonia on chest radiograph plus evidence of respiratory failure) that constitute a selffulfilling prophecy for fatality; as with many illnesses studied epidemiologically, severe diseases are more likely to receive optimal diagnostic work-up ('detection bias'); and most H5N1 cases have been reported from countries with limited resources for identifying milder cases, if they occurred. These factors together could combine to erroneously inflate casefatality calculations by over-counting severe cases and under-counting mild cases 55 .
 However, potentially more important clues to actual H5N1 pathogenicity and human casefatality rates come from epidemiological studies, which taken together suggest to us that H5N1 may not be highly lethal except in people with rare susceptibilities. Forty-six published H5N1 seroprevalence studies of various exposure categories (household contacts, healthcare workers, poultry workers, and so on) show generally low H5N1 seroprevalence (mean, 1.7% of 21,435 persons examined in all 46 studies combined (a bibliography of these studies is available from the authors on request)). Given intense poultry and other exposures in many study areas, these low rates at first seem perplexing, especially when compared to the much higher seroprevalence rates in humans for other avian influenza viruses such as H9N2 (ref. 56) . When such information is considered in light of statistically significant clustering of non-human-transmitted (that is, presumably avian-acquired) household cases in genetically related versus unrelated persons 57,58 , a reasonable explanation seems to us to be that H5N1 is so poorly adapted to humans that exposure does not normally lead to infection or even the development of a detectable immune response 57, 59 , except in persons with specific but undefined genetic susceptibilities, many of whom become cases [60] [61] [62] . There are few data on what the basis of such genetic susceptibilities may be, although recent evidence has linked severe human influenza to a minor IFITM3 allele 63 , supporting the suspicion that genetic determinants of influenza infection and replication in humans do exist.
 A published meta-analysis of selected seroprevalence studies implies that the actual H5N1 case-fatality rate may be far below 1% (ref. 56) , and thus probably far below the casefatality rates for seasonal influenza. This has been disputed because it has been difficult to find mild cases, and because of the possibility that some low-level antibody titres (<1:80) might be false positives 5 . On the other hand, rapid disappearance of human H5N1 vaccineinduced antibody 64 suggests that the opposite problem of false negatives could be occurring and, if so, might be especially problematic in cross-sectional studies in which the time since infection is not known, and which could in some cases be long enough for antibody titres to wane to sub-threshold or undetectable levels.
 Given such confusing information, there has been little agreement so far on the important question of asymptomatic and undetected H5N1 infections. But whatever the case, unless healthy seropositive people detected in seroprevalence studies temporally and geographically associated with H5N1 cases are all falsely seropositive, their addition to exposure denominators greatly decreases case-fatality determinations. For example, the 1997 Hong Kong H5N1 outbreak case-fatality rate of 33.3% (ref. 65) drops to around 3% with the addition of exposed seropositive persons detected in the related seroprevalence studies. Similar recalculations of other data would yield far lower rates, and wider seroprevalence studies would undoubtedly lower case-fatality rates even further.
 Thus, an explanation for the apparent case-fatality rate/seroprevalence paradox may not be purely one of missing cases. Like other poorly adapted viruses that rarely infect humans 34 , the H5N1 virus may simply be productively infecting too few of the people exposed to it, even in situations of widespread human contact, leaving minimal immunological evidence of exposure at the population level, while at the same time 'finding' and infecting those occasional persons with unusual susceptibilities to it; that is, cases 59 . Even so, it should be remembered that limited spread of a deadly H5N1 virus, or pandemic H5N1 spread associated with a far lower case-fatality rate, would still be of public health concern.
 Owing to global concern over a possible H5N1 influenza pandemic, the pathogenicity, immunogenicity and transmissibility of naturally occurring and laboratory-derived H5N1 viruses have been examined extensively and safely using high-containment facilities and appropriate regulatory and safety oversight (see later). The two H5N1 studies under discussion 1,2 build upon and are the logical extensions of dozens of similar published studies performed in the wake of the 1997 Hong Kong H5N1 outbreak. This research includes another published study in which genetic engineering of the H5N1 virus was able to newly create transmissibility in ferrets 66 , a similar study in which increased ferret transmissibility was not documented 67 , and a study in which transmissibility was restored and arguably increased in guinea pigs 68 . None of these publications, including the prior publication of engineered H5N1 transmissibility in ferrets, led to concern among scientists, federal agencies or the public.
 Such studies feature numerous pathogenicity-associated, and sometimes transmissibilityassociated, mutations affecting the HA-receptor-binding site, including changes that enhance receptor affinity for α2-6-linked sialic acid receptors, thought to be important for human adaptation 25, [69] [70] [71] . Other studies have examined mutations associated with changing antigenicity 72, 73 , changes associated with fusion 25, 74 , changes associated with the polybasic HA cleavage site [75] [76] [77] , and virulence factors in the polymerase proteins, crucial for viral replication 24, 68 , and in the non-structural protein (NS1), involved in antagonizing host type I interferon responses [78] [79] [80] . This widely available body of published research complicates determination of what to do with these two and with similar research manuscripts that seem likely to continue to appear. Withholding or redacting them does not prevent anyone from piecing together the basic information that they contain. Most of this information is generally known and relatively obvious, has already been published, and is now being widely publicized and discussed as a result of increased attention 11, 13, 14, 81, 82 .
 Some would argue that even this background research should not have been done, or should henceforth be classified and made available only to 'approved' scientists who would be vetted by yet-to-be-determined mechanisms 83, 84 . But had these former studies not been made available in the open literature, the field of influenza research would have been considerably impeded and our current state of knowledge and readiness for responding to future outbreaks and/or pandemics would be lessened. Some proposed that 'censoring' this information actually increases the risk of bioterrorism 85 . The two studies under discussion 1,2 can help augment surveillance to detect naturally emerging viruses with pandemic potential and expand our knowledge of the principles underlying host adaptation. Although the dangers of 'information release' in the case of these two studies is probably small or nil-because all or most of the critical information is widely available anyway-it nevertheless remains important to rethink larger questions about balancing safety (accidental or deliberate release of an influenza virus or any dangerous pathogen) with the need to study such viruses to learn enough of their biology to prevent and control them. These are important issues that should be discussed broadly among scientists, policy makers and the public.
 As novel pathogens emerge, scientists must be able to continue to work with them safely and appropriately in teams using the talents of many highly trained researchers. Numerous layers of robust biosafety and bio-security protection and oversight are in place to safeguard the scientists and the public alike, including rigorous safety training, biocontainment practices, regulations and oversight, select agent rules, background investigations and biosurety oversight 86 . The H5N1 studies under discussion 1,2 were both performed in high containment laboratories with rigorous and appropriate oversight and biosecurity measures 15 , as is the case for all such research in the US.
 Few disagree that it is crucial to continue research with H5N1 and other emerging infections, including investigation of how emerging pathogens adapt to new hosts and cause disease. However, it is important to ask whether some types of infectious diseases research should not be done, or not published openly. If so, we need criteria to identify such research in advance, and processes to balance the importance of the research knowledge with the importance of preventing adverse consequences of the research 87 . Even with the eventual publication of the two H5N1 studies, questions about how such research should be approved, evaluated and made public remain unanswered 83, 84 . The biomedical field is built on more than a century of openness and full publication/broad discussion of all findings; it is unclear how redacted publications of future scientific data can be accomplished, and what effect such a system would have on science and scientific progress.
 These complex questions have been asked and answered in the past 87 , and are being asked again in the context of these two papers. Continued discussion and decisions about how to deal with this research will be of importance to scientific progress and public health. We believe that it is important to consider the broader context of research aimed at understanding how influenza viruses adapt to humans. H5N1 is only one of many avian influenza viruses. If, as we believe existing data suggest, pathways to human adaptation are many, virus-specific, and with few common denominators, it will be important to study not just H5N1 but a wide range of avian and mammalian-and human-adapted viruses, including studies that feature backward genetic engineering to remove phenotypic determinants of adaptation, studies in nonhuman primates and, when safe and appropriate to do so, in human challenge studies 88 .
 The H5N1 controversy underscores how little is known about determinants of human influenza pathogenicity and transmissibility, which are among the most fundamentally important questions in infectious disease research because of the huge burden of influenza.
 In the past two decades the question of pursuing and publishing potential 'dual use' infectious disease research has always been decided in favour of conducting and publishing the research; for example, delineating the genomes of smallpox 89 and SARS viruses 90 , defining the pathogenicity of neuraminidase-inhibitor-resistant influenza viruses 91,92 , genetically altering and making ferret transmissible both a more pathogenic pandemic H2N2 influenza virus 93 and an H9N2 avian influenza virus 40 , and resurrecting from RNA fragments, recreating and studying in vivo the 1918 pandemic influenza virus [94] [95] [96] . In the latter case, important findings already have markedly enhanced our understanding of the emergence, transmissibility and pathogenicity of that important virus, helping us to prepare for and respond to the emergence of other influenza viruses. Examples include using the 1918 HA crystal structure in vaccine design 97 , investigating the role of the host immune response in disease 98, 99 , identification of mutations associated with pathogenicity and host adaptation 36, 100, 101 , understanding influenza evolution 21 , and helping guide and target the response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic 53, 102 . All of this work has been done safely with appropriate oversight, and without negative consequences.
 In considering the threat of bioterrorism or accidental release of genetically engineered viruses, it is worth remembering that nature is the ultimate bioterrorist. Indeed, H5N1 mutations, including some of those made in the two studies under discussion 1,2 , occur spontaneously in nature, probably at a high rate, although they have not yet led to a pandemic. Given the relative rarity of pandemics caused by newly emerging influenza viruses, their explosive transmissibility may result from unique and virus-specific mutational changes that arise at very low frequency. For past pandemics, we have had limited ability to detect such changes by surveillance or by animal model experimentation. Thus, our best hope in preventing and controlling the microbial agents that continually challenge us is to increase fundamental knowledge about the mechanisms by which they emerge, spread and cause disease, so that we can develop countermeasures such as enhanced surveillance, better diagnostics, vaccines and drug therapies. In moving forward we need to be safety conscious and to have consensus safety measures and policies in place, while at the same time using all available tools to seek broad understanding about the complex relationships between viruses and hosts. It is only this knowledge that stands between us and the devastation of future influenza pandemics. In reconsidering the proper balance between progress and safety, the critical importance of advancing scientific knowledge needs to be kept front and centre.",2c98d60bdb03ef4b0cc7c08bddb0e6947ab7cac9,2012-06-01,"Morens, David M.; Subbarao, Kanta; Taubenberger, Jeffery K.",Nature,10.1038/nature11170,Nature,1096.0,True,"Knowledgeable observers operating within a legitimate framework for the public good have expressed divergent opinions about the importance and public safety implications of two papers, one recently published 1 and one soon-to-be published 2 , describing the production of ferret-transmissible H5N1 influenza viruses, and about related influenza transmission and pathogenesis research [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . How do these assumptions hold up against scientific data? Countless influenza A viruses circulate globally in a reservoir that consists of hundreds of avian species. Rarely, one of these viruses undergoes changes that enable it to switch hosts to infect mammals, including humans, although it is not clear whether human transmission can result directly from adaptation of an avian influenza virus (this has not been documented to occur), or only indirectly via further adaptation of pre-existing human or mammalian-adapted viruses, the mechanism that has been associated with all known pandemic and seasonal viruses after 1918. However, because avian influenza viruses have adapted to other mammals, it is considered plausible that such an emergence could occur in humans. Much H5N1 research of this type has already been published, including viral genetic engineering to evaluate properties such as pathogenicity and transmissibility in ferrets and other animal models. In the context of this published research literature, we comment on questions relevant to the two papers under discussion 1,2 . Solely on the basis of publicly available information about pathogenicity of intranasally inoculated H5N1 virus (the model for natural human and animal infection), the laboratoryderived H5N1 viruses produced in the two papers under discussion 1,11-15 do not have enhanced pathogenicity in ferrets compared to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, which is considered to be mildly pathogenic for humans 14, 15 . As documented since the 1940s 16 , intratracheal inoculation of influenza viruses is not a 'model' for natural viral pathogenicity; influenza viruses that are otherwise considered to be of low pathogenicity often induce severe and even fatal disease in animals when administered by this route, including the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus 15 . No evidence has yet been presented to support this, although the possibility that additional unspecified genetic changes might do so cannot be excluded. It is questionable to what extent HPAI H5N1 is adapted to, or capable of adapting to, humans. It may be that the human cases are a result of unusual high-dose exposures or rare individual genetic susceptibilities. Ferrets are thus an imperfect model for predicting human infectivity or transmissibility, let alone the high level of transmissibility characteristic of pandemic spread. Moreover, because determinants of viral pathogenicity may be lost upon adaptation to a new host, H5N1 viruses, whether or not transmissible, do not always cause severe disease in ferrets or non-human primates [45] [46] [47] . For these reasons viral phenotypes observed in animal models like the ferret may not predict what would happen in humans. Such insights can provide valuable clues in designing countermeasures against deadly epidemics and pandemics. Case fatality refers to fatal cases divided by all fatal plus non-fatal cases combined.) Given intense poultry and other exposures in many study areas, these low rates at first seem perplexing, especially when compared to the much higher seroprevalence rates in humans for other avian influenza viruses such as H9N2 (ref.

2,2,3135e20ef016fa4b3690d585ccd2057ee8c15879,,Global trends in emerging infectious diseases HHS Public Access,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a significant burden on global economies and public health 1-3 . Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors 1-9 , but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID 'events' (origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (60.3% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drugresistant microbes in our database. Our results confirm that EID origins are significantly correlated with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease 'hotspots'). They also reveal a substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs originating at lower latitudes where reporting effort is low. We conclude that global resources to counter disease emergence are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate.","In the global human population, we report the emergence of 335 infectious diseases between 1940 and 2004. Here we define the first temporal origination of an EID (that is, the original case or cluster of cases representing an infectious disease emerging in human populations for the first time-see Methods and Supplementary Table 1 ) as an EID 'event'. Our database includes EID events caused by newly evolved strains of pathogens (for example, multi-drugresistant tuberculosis and chloroquine-resistant malaria), pathogens that have recently entered human populations for the first time (for example, HIV-1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus), and pathogens that have probably been present in humans historically, but which have recently increased in incidence (for example, Lyme disease). The emergence of these pathogens and their subsequent spread have caused an extremely significant impact on global health and economies [1] [2] [3] . Previous efforts to understand patterns of EID emergence have highlighted viral pathogens (especially RNA viruses) as a major threat, owing to their often high rates of nucleotide substitution, poor mutation errorcorrection ability and therefore higher capacity to adapt to new hosts, including humans 5, 8, 10, 11 . However, we find that the majority of pathogens involved in EID events are bacterial or rickettsial (54.3%). This group is typically represented by the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial strains (for example, vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Viral or prion pathogens constitute only 25.4% of EID events, in contrast to previous analyses which suggest that 37-44% of emerging pathogens are viruses or prions and 10-30% bacteria or rickettsia 5, 8, 11 . This follows our classification of each individual drugresistant microbial strain as a separate pathogen in our database, and reflects more accurately the true significance of antimicrobial drug resistance for global health, in which different pathogen strains can cause separate significant outbreaks 12 . In broad concurrence with previous studies on the characteristics of emerging human pathogens 5, 8, 11 , we find the percentages of EID events caused by other pathogen types to be 10.7% for protozoa, 6.3% for fungi and 3.3% for helminths (see Supplementary Data and Supplementary Table 2 for a detailed comparison to previous studies).
 The incidence of EID events has increased since 1940, reaching a maximum in the 1980s (Fig. 1) . We tested whether the increase through time was largely attributable to increasing infectious disease reporting effort (that is, through more efficient diagnostic methods and more thorough surveillance 2,3,13 ) by calculating the annual number of articles published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases (JID) since 1945 (see Methods). Controlling for reporting effort, the number of EID events still shows a highly significant relationship with time (generalized linear model with Poisson errors, offset by log(JID articles) (GLM P,JID ), F = 96.4, P < 0.001, d.f. = 57). This provides the first analytical support for previous suggestions that the threat of EIDs to global health is increasing 1,2,14 . To further investigate the peak in EID events in the 1980s, we examined the most frequently cited driver of EID emergence during this period (see Supplementary Table 1) . Increased susceptibility to infection caused the highest proportion of events during 1980-90 (25.5%), and we therefore suggest that the spike in EID events in the 1980s is due largely to the emergence of new diseases associated with the HIV/AIDS pandemic 2,13 .
 The majority (60.3%) of EID events are caused by zoonotic pathogens (defined here as those which have a non-human animal source), which is consistent with previous analyses of human EIDs 5, 8 . Furthermore, 71.8% of these zoonotic EID events were caused by pathogens with a wildlife origin-for example, the emergence of Nipah virus in Perak, Malaysia and SARS in Guangdong Province, China. The number of EID events caused by pathogens originating in wildlife has increased significantly with time, controlling for reporting effort (GLM P,JID F = 60.7, P < 0.001, d.f. = 57), and they constituted 52.0% of EID events in the most recent decade (1990-2000) (Fig. 1) . This supports the suggestion that zoonotic EIDs represent an increasing and very significant threat to global health 1, 2, 7, 13, 14 . It also highlights the importance of understanding the factors that increase contact between wildlife and humans in developing predictive approaches to disease emergence 4, 6, 9, 15 .
 Vector-borne diseases are responsible for 22.8% of EID events in our database, and 28.8% in the last decade (Fig. 1) . Our analysis reveals a significant rise in the number of EID events they have caused over time, controlling for reporting effort (GLM P,JID F = 49.8, P < 0.001, d.f. = 57). This rise corresponds to climate anomalies occurring during the 1990s 16 , adding support to hypotheses that climate change may drive the emergence of diseases that have vectors sensitive to changes in environmental conditions such as rainfall, temperature and severe weather events 17 . However, this controversial issue requires further analyses to test causal relationships between EID events and climate change 18 . We also report that EID events caused by drug-resistant microbes (which represent 20.9% of the EID events in our database) have significantly increased with time, controlling for reporting effort (GLM P,JID F = 5.19, P< 0.05, d.f. = 57). This is probably related to a corresponding rise in antimicrobial drug use, particularly in high-latitude developed countries 2,7,12 .
 A recent analysis showed a latitudinal spatial gradient in human pathogen species richness increasing towards the Equator 19 , in common with the distributional pattern of species richness found in many other taxonomic groups 20 . Environmental parameters that promote pathogen transmission at lower latitudes (for example, higher temperatures and precipitation) are hypothesized to drive this pattern 19 . Our analyses suggest that there is no such pattern in EID events, which are concentrated in higher latitudes ( Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The highest concentration of EID events per million square kilometres of land was found between 30 and 60 degrees north and between 30 and 40 degrees south, with the main hotspots in the northeastern United States, western Europe, Japan and southeastern Australia (Fig. 2 ). We hypothesize that (1) socioeconomic drivers (such as human population density, antibiotic drug use and agricultural practices) are major determinants of the spatial distribution of EID events, in addition to the ecological or environmental conditions that may affect overall (emerging and non-emerging) human pathogen distribution 19 , and (2) that the importance of these drivers depends on the category of EID event. In particular, we hypothesize that EID events caused by zoonotic pathogens from wildlife are significantly correlated with wildlife biodiversity, and those caused by drug-resistant pathogens are more correlated with socio-economic conditions than those caused by zoonotic pathogens.
 We tested these hypotheses by examining the relationship between the spatial pattern of the different categories of EID events (zoonotic pathogens originating in wildlife and nonwildlife, drug-resistant and vector-borne pathogens, Supplementary Fig. 2 ), and socioeconomic variables (human population density and human population growth), environmental variables (latitude, rainfall) and an ecological variable (wildlife host species richness) (see Methods). We found that human population density was a common significant independent predictor of EID events in all categories, controlling for spatial reporting bias by country (see Methods, Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3 ). This supports previous hypotheses that disease emergence is largely a product of anthropogenic and demographic changes, and is a hidden 'cost' of human economic development 2, 4, 7, 9, 13 . Wildlife host species richness is a significant predictor for the emergence of zoonotic EIDs with a wildlife origin, with no role for human population growth, latitude or rainfall ( Table 1 ). The emergence of zoonotic EIDs from non-wildlife hosts is predicted by human population density, human population growth, and latitude, and not by wildlife host species richness. EID events caused by drug-resistant microbes are affected by human population density and growth, latitude and rainfall. The pattern of EID events caused by vector-borne diseases was not correlated with any of the environmental or ecological variables we examined, although we note that the climate variable used in this analysis (rainfall) does not represent climate change phenomena.
 Our study examines the role of only a few drivers to understand disease emergence, whereas many other factors (for example, land use change, agriculture) have been causally linked to EIDs 6,21 . However, until more rigorous global data sets of these drivers become available, data on human population density and growth act as reasonable proxies for such anthropogenic changes. Other likely future improvements to the model would include a more accurate accounting for temporal and spatial ascertainment biases-for example, the development of global spatial data sets of the amount of funding per capita for infectious disease surveillance.
 Our analyses provide a basis for developing a predictive model for the regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease 'hotspots'). A visualization of the regression results from Table 1 for EID events from each category (Fig. 3) identifies these regions globally. This approach may be valuable for deciding where to allocate global resources to pre-empt, or combat, the first stages of disease emergence 10, 14, 18, 22 . Our analysis shows that there is a high spatial reporting bias for EID events (see Methods, Supplementary Fig. 3) , reflecting greater surveillance and infectious disease research effort in richer, developed countries of Europe, North America, Australia and some parts of Asia, than in developing regions. This contrasts with our risk maps (Fig. 3) , which suggest that predicted emerging disease hotspots due to zoonotic pathogens from wildlife and vectorborne pathogens are more concentrated in lower-latitude developing countries. We conclude that the global effort for EID surveillance and investigation is poorly allocated, with the majority of our scientific resources focused on places from where the next important emerging pathogen is least likely to originate. We advocate re-allocation of resources for 'smart surveillance' of emerging disease hotspots in lower latitudes, such as tropical Africa, Latin America and Asia, including targeted surveillance of at-risk people to identify early case clusters of potentially new EIDs before their large-scale emergence. Zoonoses from wildlife represent the most significant, growing threat to global health of all EIDs (see our data in Fig. 1 , and recent reviews 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14 ) . Our findings highlight the critical need for health monitoring 4,14,23 and identification of new, potentially zoonotic pathogens in wildlife populations, as a forecast measure for EIDs. Finally, our analysis suggests that efforts to conserve areas rich in wildlife diversity by reducing anthropogenic activity may have added value in reducing the likelihood of future zoonotic disease emergence.
 Biological, temporal and spatial data on human EID 'events' were collected from the literature from 1940 (yellow fever virus, Nuba Mountains, Sudan) until 2004 (poliovirus type 2 in Uttar Pradesh, India) (n = 335, see Supplementary Data for data and sources). Global allocation of scientific resources for disease surveillance has been focused on rich, developed countries ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . It is thus likely that EID discovery is biased both temporally (by increasing research effort into human pathogens over the period of the database) and spatially (by the uneven levels of surveillance across countries). We account for these biases by quantifying reporting effort in JID and including it in our temporal and spatial analyses. JID is the premier international journal (highest ISI impact factor 2006: http://portal.isiknowledge.com/) of human infectious disease research that publishes papers on both emerging and non-emerging infectious diseases without a specific geographical bias. To investigate the drivers of the spatial pattern of EID events, we compared the location of EID events to five socio-economic, environmental and ecological variables matched onto a terrestrial one degree grid of the globe. We carried out the spatial analyses using a multivariable logistic regression to control for co-variability between drivers, with the presence/absence of EID events as the dependent variable and all drivers plus our measure of spatial reporting bias by country as independent variables (n = 18,307 terrestrial grid cells). Analyses were conducted on subsets of the EID events-those caused by zoonotic pathogens (defined in our analyses as pathogens that originated in non-human animals) originating in wildlife and non-wildlife species, and those caused by drug-resistant and vector-borne pathogens.
 In this paper, we are analysing the process of disease emergence, not just the pathogens that cause them. Therefore, we focus on EID 'events', which we define as the first temporal emergence of a pathogen in a human population which was related to the increase in distribution, increase in incidence or increase in virulence or other factor which led to that pathogen being classed as an emerging disease 2, 4, 5, 8, 13, 15 . We chose the 1940 cut-offbased on the Institute of Medicine's 2 examples of a currently or very recently emerging disease, all of which had their likely temporal origins within this time period. Single case reports of a new pathogen were not considered to represent the emergence of a disease, and emergence was normally represented by reports, in more than one peer-reviewed paper, of a cluster of cases that were identified in humans for the first time, or (for previously known diseases) considered significantly above background. Only events that had sufficient corroborating evidence for their geographic and temporal origin were included in our analysis. We based our data collection on the list of EIDs in ref. 5 updated to 2004 . Unlike this previous study 5 , we treated different drug-resistant strains of the same microbial species as separate pathogens and the cause of separate EID events (for example, the emergence of the chloroquine-resistant strain of the malaria pathogen (Plasmodium falciparum) in Trujillo, Venezuela in 1957 and the sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine-resistant strain in Sa Kaeo, Thailand in 1981).
 The biological, temporal and spatial variable definitions of an EID event used are as follows: italic font indicates classes of the variables. (1) 'Pathogen', name of pathogen associated with the EID event. (2) 'Year' (the earliest year in which the first cluster of cases representing each EID event was reported to have occurred was taken where a range of years was given). For these descriptions, accurate spatial coordinates (point location data) were found for 51.8% of EID events (n = 220) using Global Gazetteer v.2.1 (http://www.fallingrain.com/ world/) and these were assigned to corresponding one degree terrestrial spatial grids. Some EID event locations were lesser known and only described sub-regionally or regionally (for example, SARS in ""Guangdong Province, China"" or enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli in ""Peru""). These locations were assigned corresponding boundaries from ESRI sub-regional or regional data 24 and we randomly selected only one grid cell from the possible grid cells to represent each particular event. This treated these lesser known events equivalently to those that were assigned a specific point location.
 Definitions of the spatial drivers used are as follows: (1) 'Human population density' for 2000 25 (persons per km 2 ); (2) 'Human population growth', calculated between 1990 and 2000 25 .We used a dummy variable to indicate grid cells that experienced rapid growth in human population. This variable was set to 1 for grid cells where the 1990-2000 human population growth exceeded 25% over the decade, and was set to 0 elsewhere; (3) 'Latitude' (absolute latitude of the central point of each grid cell, decimal degrees); (4) 'Rainfall' 26 (average rainfall per year, mm); (5) 'Wildlife host species richness'. We calculated mammalian species richness as a proxy for wildlife host species richness. Richness grids were generated from geographic distribution maps for 4,219 terrestrial mammalian species 27 .
 For our temporal analysis, we included the number of JID articles per year since 1945 (n TOTAL = 17,979 articles) as an offset in our generalized linear model using a Poisson error structure. To control for bias in our spatial analysis, we calculated the frequency of the country listed as the address for every author (lead author and coauthors) in each JID article since 1973. This generated a measure of reporting effort for each country which was matched to the one degree spatial grid for analysis and was included in the multiple logistic regression models.
 Each logistic regression was repeated ten times using a separate random draw of the EID event grids for those events where the region reported covered more than one grid cell. The analyses are summarized in Table 1 , and given in full in Supplementary Table 3 . Different random draws can produce a different number of grid cells with events, even though the number of events does not change. For graphical purposes (that is, in Figs 2 and 3, and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2) , we display the first random draw of the EID event grids. Human population density and number of JID articles were log-transformed before analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS (v. 12.0) 28 and R (v. 2.2.1) 29 . As the spatial autocorrelation (measured using Moran's I) in the EID event occurrence spatial grids was low (0.1), the data were assumed to represent independent points in these analyses.

Here we create then analyze a database of 2,805 mammal-virus associations, including 754 mammal species (14% of global mammal diversity) from 15 orders and 586 unique viral species (every recognized virus found in mammals 16 ) from 28 viral families (Methods). We use these data to test hypotheses on the determinants of viral richness and viral sharing with humans. Second, we identify and rank the ecological, phylogenetic, and life-history traits that make some species more likely hosts of zoonoses than others. Several domestic ungulate species (orders Cetartiodactyla and Perissodactyla) are outliers for their number of observed viruses, but these species have a relatively low proportion of zoonotic viruses ( Fig. However, these studies weight all species equally. We hypothesize that the number of viruses a given mammal species shares with humans decreases with phylogenetic distance from humans and increases with opportunity for human contact. Host geographic range was also significantly associated with increasing total viral richness, although the strength of this effect was low (Fig. Our best model to predict the number of zoonotic viruses per wild mammal species explained 82% of the deviance, and included phylogenetic distance from humans, a ratio of urban to rural human population across a species range, host order, whether or not a species is hunted, research effort, and total viral richness (Extended Data Table 1) . 2g ) that may represent an artifact of preferentially screening marsupials for human viruses. 2i ) -suggesting that continuous variation in phylogenetic distance across primate species is more important, and is significant even when all mammals are included. A single global metric of human-wildlife ecological contact did not emerge across models. Overall, the strength of the effect of phylogenetic distance was stronger than our proxies for animal-human contact in predicting proportion of zoonoses (30-44% stronger explanatory factor), but both remained significant after controlling for research effort (Extended Data Table 1 ). We then project these 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' geographically ( Fig. Geographic hotspots of 'missing zoonoses' vary by host taxonomic order, with foci for carnivores and even-toed ungulates in Eastern and Southern Africa, bats in South and Central America and parts of Asia, primates in specific tropical regions in Central America, Africa, and Southeast Asia; and rodents in pockets of North and South America and Central Africa. Areas where 'missing zoonoses' predictions were systematically biased varied by taxonomic order, but included large parts of Africa for the all mammal dataset (Fig. We acknowledge several important caveats. Third, while we control for research effort we cannot account for viruses or host associations that have completely evaded human detection to date, nor those identified but not published. The analyses reported herein have broad potential to assist in expediting viral discovery programs for public health. To narrow the search for hosts for well-researched viruses, we additionally included the terms ""host(s)"", ""reservoir"", ""wildlife"", ""animals"", ""surveillance"", and other relevant terms to find publications related to host range. Stringent data' were analyzed separately to remove potential uncertainty due to cross-reactivity with related viruses. In order to address influence of transmission from humans to wildlife in our models, we also ran our GAM model fitting and selection procedure (see below) on a subset of data that excluded any probable 'reverse zoonotic' viruses. We present these additional analyses excluding 'reverse zoonoses' and associated code at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.569079. We recorded two values for the number of research papers for a host. Only one measure of per host research effort was included at a time in model selection. We used the body mass recorded in the PanTHERIA database 37 for 709 species. For 3 species, we used the second choice option, body mass recorded in the AnAge database 38 . More importantly, a wholesale effort to control for phylogeny across all variables in our analysis was not appropriate here, as we are explicitly testing the relative importance of phylogenetic distance to humans vs. other host traits including measures of human-wildlife contact to predict the proportion of zoonotic viruses for a given host species. This left body mass as the only variable in our models, excluding our direct measures of phylogenetic distance, with a significant Blomberg K value that was greater than one. PVR body mass was included in our GAM model selection for the total viral richness and zoonotic virus models. Cytb gene fragments ranged from 143 to 1140bp, with >1000bp available for 558/665 (84%) of the taxa. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE with default setting in Geneious R6, and checked visually for errors 47 . Matrices of pairwise patristic distances between all species, including Homo sapiens, were calculated from the two phylogenies using the 'cophenetic' function in the R package ape 46 . We aggregated these PHB values using mean, median, or maximum values at a viral species, genus and viral family level to generate higher-level taxonomic variables of host breadth per viral group. Symbols (circles) at terminal taxa additionally added to better visualize residual value colors were added using willeerd.nodelabels function (dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10855). All marine mammals, domestic animals, and other taxa with missing data were coded as grey for missing data. R code for primary figure generation is provided in the code repository. We used automated term selection by double penalty smoothing 53 to eliminate variables from the models. In this case dropping variables by double penalty smoothing still allowed pruning the model list to eliminate redundant models. For human population variables, we looked at either variables measuring overlap of species range with humanoccupied areas, or human population in those areas, as area-and population-based measures were highly co-linear. We used a binomial GAM to analyze the 586 mammalian viruses in our database and identify viral traits that may serve as predictors of zoonotic potential. We inspected models within 2 AIC units of the model with the lowest AIC, and present the outputs of the best-fit and all other top models (<2 ΔAIC) in our data and code repository. We found this variable had a coefficient near to one when it was used as a linear predictor, indicating its appropriateness as an offset. Our top models consistently outperform the alternatives by wide margins, as measured by AIC. We used k-fold cross-validation to evaluate goodness of fit for all models. The data was divided into 10 folds, selected randomly. Using QGIS 56 , a mammal-specific zoogeographical shapefile provided by Holt's group at the University of Copenhagen (http:// macroecology.ku.dk/resources/wallace) was intersected (using QGIS Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Intersect) with a shapefile of IUCN's host ranges for all mammals in our database. Non-significant results indicate that model predictions are unbiased. The presence of biased regions in our zoogeographic cross-validation suggested the possibility that there is a systematic bias associated with geography not captured by the Olival predictor variables in our models. The all-data zoonoses model, which was used to create the series of maps in the main manuscript, does not improve with the inclusion of zoogeographical region. However, the improved predictive power of models using region-specific terms is offset by the increase in degrees of freedom (i.e. if we included 31 zoogeographic regions as separate terms) and, more importantly, a decreased interpretability of our models -especially when compared to the geographical variables we used, such as host area or species range overlap with human modified habitat. Instead, we indicate areas of geographic bias directly on our spatially mapped outputs. ( See ""Calculating and visualizing 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses'"", below.) The ratio of urban to rural population allowed us to separate these signals and best represent this proxy of per species human-wildlife contact. We used geographic range maps from the IUCN spatial database (2015.2) to visualize the spatial distribution of observed host-virus associations, observed host-zoonoses association, these associations as predicted under maximum research, and the maximum predictedobserved viruses, or the 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' (e.g. Table 4 ). Each grid cell was assigned a value of one to indicate presence. In the process of translating our non-spatial, species-level predictions to geographic space (i.e. layered raster maps), we identified several geographic areas where our model predictions of the number of total and zoonotic viruses were systematically biased, i.e. pvalue <0.05 (Supplementary Table 3 ). For each grid cell we calculated whether the bias exceeded that expected from a random sampling of hosts. We calculated this for all mammals, and separately for each order across all grid cells. Animal silhouettes added to associations. Significant variables from each best-fit GAM are noted with an *. Secondly, host and virus specific factors may facilitate viral spillover.

3,3,91f501efec7d447450dfe8d9d78d9b576155befa,,Epidemic dynamics at the human-animal interface NIH Public Access A Taxonomy for Zoonotic Dynamics Dynamical Models for Zoonoses,"Few infectious diseases are entirely human-specific: most human pathogens also circulate in animals, or else originated in non-human hosts. Influenza, plague, and trypanosomiasis are classic examples of zoonoses, or infections that transmit from animals to humans. The multi-host ecology of zoonoses leads to complex dynamics, and analytical tools such as mathematical modeling are vital to the development of effective control policies and research agendas. Much attention has focused on modeling pathogens with simpler life cycles and immediate global urgency, such as influenza and SARS, but vector-transmitted, chronic, and protozoan infections have been neglected, as have crucial processes such as cross-species transmission. Progress in understanding and combating zoonoses requires a new generation of models that addresses a broader set of pathogen life histories and integrates across host species and scientific disciplines.
 A recent survey of all recognized human pathogens revealed that over half are zoonotic (1, 2), and nearly all of the most important human pathogens are either zoonotic or originated as zoonoses before adapting to humans (3). The three most devastating pandemics in human history, the Black Death, Spanish influenza, and HIV/AIDS, were caused by zoonoses (4), as were 60-76% of recent emerging infectious disease events (2, 5). Underlying these patterns are specific public health challenges arising from the complex multi-host ecology of zoonotic infections (6, 7), and accelerating environmental and anthropogenic changes that are altering the rates and nature of contact between human and animal populations (8-10). Following a series of recent outbreaks (e.g., avian and swine influenza, West Nile virus and SARS), a rising sense of urgency has stimulated a broad increase in research on zoonoses, ranging from dissection of the molecular determinants of host specificity (11) to viral prospecting in African rain forests (12). Such endeavors have produced important insights into underlying patterns and basic mechanisms of disease, but integrating this new knowledge across scales and applying the results to public health policy are difficult given the non-linear and cross-species interactions inherent to zoonotic infections (13). These complexities can be addressed by harnessing the integrative power and mechanistic insights attainable from analysis of population dynamic models of zoonotic transmission. Here, we review the role of dynamical modeling in the study of zoonoses through an analysis of the current status of the field. Our specific goal is to detect gaps in present knowledge and †","identify the priorities for future research that will unify, focus, and propel the interdisciplinary push to combat zoonoses. Wolfe et al. (3) proposed a useful classification scheme for pathogens, delineating five stages spanning the range from those exclusively infecting animals (stage I) to those exclusively infecting humans (stage V). The zoonotic component of this scheme (stages II-IV) can be divided into the constituent phases of transmission and associated epidemiological mechanisms (Fig. 1A) . Stage II pathogens are those, like West Nile virus or Brucella abortus, that can transmit from animals to humans to cause 'primary' infections but do not exhibit human-to-human ('secondary') transmission. Stage III pathogens, such as monkeypox virus and Leishmania infantum, spill over into human populations from animal reservoirs and can cause limited cycles of human-to-human transmission that stutter to extinction. Stage IV pathogens persist in animal reservoirs but can cause self-sustaining chains of transmission in human populations; examples include Yersinia pestis (plague) and pandemic influenza. Our approach diverges from Wolfe et al. by basing the distinction among stages II-IV on the basic reproductive number, R 0 , from the perspective of the human 'spillover' hosts. This quantity, defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infectious individual in a wholly susceptible population, is a central concept in epidemiological theory (14, 15) . R 0 enables us to distinguish stages II-IV on dynamical grounds since it quantitatively demarcates pathogens capable of sustained transmission among humans (those with R 0 >1) from those doomed to stutter to local extinction (R 0 <1) or those with no onward transmission (R 0 =0). The dynamics of all zoonoses involve multiple phases, including transmission in the animal reservoir, spillover transmission into humans, and possibly stuttering or sustained transmission among humans. Cross-species spillover transmission is the defining characteristic of a zoonosis, and examination of the factors influencing the force of infection from animals to humans (Fig.  1B ) reveals three distinct components: the prevalence of infection in the animal reservoir, the rate at which humans come into contact with these animals, and the probability that humans become infected when contact occurs. These components are each influenced by diverse properties of natural, agricultural and human systems, with important differences driven by the pathogen's mode of transmission. Significant quantitative or qualitative differences may also arise between zoonoses that use wildlife rather than domesticated animals as reservoirs, owing to differences in frequency, duration and nature of crossspecies contacts and in opportunities for human intervention (Fig. 1 ).
 Mathematical models of the population dynamics of infectious diseases (14, 15 ) use a wellestablished (and ever-growing) body of theory to construct simplified representations of epidemiological systems. Crucially, dynamical models explicitly represent the key population groups and central processes of epidemic spread. Infectious diseases differ from chronic conditions such as cancer or heart disease, because the risk of infection depends not only on personal risk factors but also upon the state of other individuals in the population. This leads to non-linear interactions among sub-groups in a population that can result in complex and sometimes counter-intuitive epidemic behavior. In the fundamental susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, groups of individuals within the host population are classified as 'susceptible' to infection, 'infected' and able to transmit the pathogen, or 'recovered' and immune to re-infection ( Fig. 2A) . Transmission of infection to new cases is driven by contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals. Though crude, this model reproduces the classical epidemic curve (Fig. 2B) , and has been remarkably successful in elucidating fundamental principles, including the 'tipping point' threshold for epidemics to take off if the basic reproduction number, or R 0 , is greater than 1, and the potential to achieve 'herd immunity' through vaccination programs.
 Because of the emphasis on mechanism, dynamical models can address questions outside the scope of statistical and geospatial analyses (Fig. 2C ). By adjusting parameter values or reformulating mechanisms, modelers can perform 'what if' experiments to study problems that are ethically or logistically unfeasible to study in the real world; for example, the efficacy of different control measures or the population-level consequences of clinical or laboratory findings can be explored. Such cross-scale synthesis also enables researchers to extract key characteristics of epidemics, such as changes in the value of the 'effective' reproductive number (R e ) as control measures are imposed or the supply of susceptible hosts is depleted. Models can also evaluate the potential influence of unknown information, helping to set priorities for data collection and define the uncertainty associated with model outcomes. Finally, dynamical models can be used to predict future trends of disease spread, although such projections must be accompanied by a comprehensive uncertainty analysis.
 Population dynamic modeling has made major contributions to our understanding of zoonotic infections. During the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic in Britain, models were used to extract and synthesize basic knowledge from clinical and epidemiological data, while also extrapolating trends from unfolding evidence about the mysterious pathogen (16, 17) . Models of rabies transmission have provided biological insight, guided vaccination policy and predicted spatial spread (18) (19) (20) . Following the emergence of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), models were applied to measure the virus's transmissibility and refine plans for epidemic containment via infection control and case isolation (21, 22) . Modeling studies predicted that quarantine would be a relatively inefficient means of controlling SARS (23, 24) , and this was confirmed in later analyses of outbreak data (25) .
 Comparative analyses have characterized epidemiological phenomena, such as host heterogeneity, across suites of zoonotic pathogens, and have coupled the findings to models to study dynamical consequences (26, 27) . For instance, analysis of detailed outbreak data shows that highly infectious 'superspreaders' exist for all pathogens (though to varying degrees), and modeling shows that their existence makes outbreaks rarer but more explosive (26) . Theoretical studies have illuminated central mechanisms relevant to zoonotic dynamics: analysis of the population dynamics of multi-host pathogens revealed the influence of host species diversity on reservoir dynamics and spillover risk (28) , while a hybrid transmission/evolution model showed the potential for stage III zoonoses to adapt to humans before their stuttering chains of transmission die out (29) . Zoonotic dynamics have clear parallels with invasion biology (as spillover, stuttering chains and outbreaks correspond roughly to the invasion phases of introduction, establishment, and population expansion) raising the possibility of fruitful cross-fertilization between theoretical frameworks for these fields (30) .
 In contrast to the complete lack of application of models during the last influenza pandemic in 1968, dynamical models now play a key role in preparing for pandemic influenza strains (e.g., 31). For example, school closure has been identified as an important control measure during the early phase of pandemic spread (32) , and was implemented in cities across the USA that were affected by H1N1 influenza (""swine flu"") in spring 2009. Models of both influenza and SARS have exposed the futility of imposing travel restrictions once a pathogen is already spreading within a region (e.g. 24, 33) , and such restrictions have been largely avoided following the recognition that the 2009 H1N1 influenza strain was already widespread when it was discovered. Meanwhile, established methods for the estimation of R 0 have helped to speed determination of this crucial parameter for the pandemic strain (34) .
 Where has modeling research concentrated across the gamut of zoonotic pathogens and epidemiological challenges? Where are the major gaps in our knowledge, and how can dynamical models be used to integrate empirical findings, guide health policy, and drive innovative research?
 We systematically surveyed 442 modeling studies addressing 85 species of zoonotic pathogens, and found surprising gaps and tremendous skews in coverage (for details see Supplementary Online Material). Viral diseases have dominated zoonotic modeling, led by pandemic influenza, SARS and rabies which together account for almost half of all zoonotic models (Table 1 ; Fig. S1 ). Bacterial and especially protozoan pathogens have received much less attention relative to their importance. Vector-borne and food-borne zoonoses have been neglected by dynamical modelers compared with infections transmitted by direct contact. Consequently, many zoonotic diseases of great public health concern, such as leptospirosis and yellow fever, have rarely been modeled (Table 1) , and so we lack a formal framework to understand the transmission dynamics of these diseases or to respond to sudden changes in their epidemiology. The current literature often fails to account for the multi-host ecology of zoonotic pathogens. The great majority of modeling studies consider just a single phase of the zoonotic process, typically focusing on dynamics in the reservoir or outbreaks in the human population (Fig. S2 ). Models incorporating spillover transmission-the defining process of zoonotic dynamics-are dismayingly rare. For directly-transmitted zoonoses, we found only six dynamical studies that include a mechanistic model of animal-to-human spillover. For vector-borne and food-borne infections, this number is higher but still a clear minority. Rather than integrating across host species and dynamical phases to address questions aimed at the zoonotic nature of these pathogens, too often we find zoonoses being treated 'piece-wise' as a concatenation of single-host processes (or worse, some phases are ignored completely).
 A similar gap is evident in the modeling of stuttering chains of transmission (Fig. S2) , wherein zoonotic pathogens transmit inefficiently among humans so any minor outbreaks triggered by spillover events inevitably die out. Despite their limited epidemic potential, such pathogens present epidemiologists with significant challenges that are often best addressed using mathematical models. For instance, monkeypox virus has long been known to spread inefficiently among humans, but its transmissibility appears to be rising as population immunity drops because fewer people have been vaccinated against smallpox (35, 36) . Surveillance data for stage III zoonoses, such as monkeypox, Nipah virus or H5N1 avian influenza, can be analyzed to estimate human-to-human transmissibility and to define signatures of possible viral adaptation to humans (37) . Given that pathogens in this class are the best-identified threats for future pandemics in the human population, study of their dynamics should be prioritized for attention.
 Several patterns stand out among the existing models (Fig. S3) . They have been primarily applied to studying the efficacy of control measures, with the secondary aims of estimating epidemiological parameters of interest and explaining observed patterns in field data. Prediction of future trends is a major focus for models of pandemic influenza and BSE, but this aim is rarely applied to other pathogens. Equally notable are the questions missing from these studies. The dynamics of pathogen populations within individual hosts individuals have rarely been included in models of zoonotic transmission dynamics, with the notable exception of food-borne pathogens where the association between pathogen titers in livestock (before and during processing into meat) and infection risk to humans has been studied. Evolutionary issues are similarly neglected, despite the pressing concerns surrounding adaptation to humans and pandemic emergence for several pathogens. It is particularly striking that of the 62 models of SARS dynamics we found, none deals with pathogen evolution, despite the accumulating evidence that the virus was adapting rapidly as it circulated among humans (38) . This gap remains because of the paucity of data linking pathogen genotypes to phenotypes at the population scale (in particular transmissibility). This is an important and tractable topic for empirical and theoretical research, especially given the increasing availability of genetic sequence data (39) . Interactions among pathogen species have also been largely neglected, even though empirical data show that co-infections are relatively common and that different pathogens can facilitate or hamper each other's spread through direct or immune-mediated interactions (40) . Finally, there has been little research that integrates transmission dynamics of zoonoses with economic considerations, despite the clear relevance of this synthesis to control policy (e.g. 32).
 A crucial component of a robust and applicable science of zoonotic dynamics is the use of data to estimate parameters and validate model output, and the thoughtful treatment of datalimited situations based on rigorous sensitivity analysis. While most studies use some data to parameterize or validate models (Fig. S3B) , their use is highly variable. At the simplest, many authors borrow data-derived parameter values from earlier studies, or fit model projections to epidemic curves. More advanced studies use dynamical reasoning to arrive at new methods of gleaning insights from available data (e.g., 41) . For studies aimed at projecting epidemic trends, the gold standard is to validate model output by comparing it with independently gathered data that has not been used for the construction of the model. Notable examples include the 'post-diction' of global spread of the 1968 influenza pandemic based on air traffic data (42) and the validation of BSE models developed for England using independent data from Northern Ireland (43) . Models can also interact powerfully with population-level experiments to confirm mechanisms underlying observed patterns (44) . Broad patterns of data usage are of course determined by the availability of relevant data sets. The free availability of epidemic curves led to two-thirds of SARS modeling studies incorporating population-level data, and early analyses of SARS disease progression enabled widespread use of data-driven parameters (45) . For influenza, the well-known clinical course of infection has enabled widespread use of data in parameterizing models, but modelfitting to epidemic curves has been less common. Studies focusing on zoonoses in their animal reservoirs (e.g. rabies and bovine tuberculosis) have relied largely on individual-level parameters, owing to the relative rarity of collated population data for animal diseases. In contrast, however, all the BSE models were fit to population data, reflecting the intensive and cumulative study of the British epidemic and later application of these methods to BSE data from other countries.
 Data-free modeling tends to be more common for pathogens that have fewer models overall; this likely reflects either the complete unavailability of data or the lack of opportunity to borrow data-informed parameter values from other studies. However, a broad and vibrant literature has applied statistical methods to analyze the epidemiological and spatial patterns of zoonotic infections (e.g., 46, 47) , and opportunities to link these findings with dynamical models too often go unrealized.
 Looking beyond the use of data, the best modeling studies are those that engage substantively, and realistically, with current thinking in biology or public health. However, detail and model complexity are not equivalent to realism, and a simple model can yield more insight than a massive simulation that is not fully understood. Detailed simulation models are necessary to address some important questions, but model complexity should be increased cautiously and with an awareness of the associated costs of reduced transparency, a multiplicity of often unknown parameters, and the resulting need for intensive investigation of how model assumptions may influence conclusions (e.g., 31). A hierarchical approach, comparing the behavior of models with different degrees of detail, can aid the design and interpretation of complex models.
 Given the prevailing focus of zoonotic models on designing and assessing control measures, and the unique potential of models to estimate important characteristics of epidemics, it is instructive to consider the timeliness with which modelers respond to emerging threats. For zoonotic pathogens that either were newly discovered or have made significant range shifts in recent decades, we constructed temporal profiles of the scientific literature to characterize the dynamics of the modeling community's response (Figs. 4 and S4) . The poster child for rapid response is SARS, for which several modeling analyses were completed within months of the pathogen's and epidemic's discovery and were influential in designing outbreak control measures. For Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, a 10-year delay from discovery to the first model has been followed by intermittent modeling efforts, perhaps reflecting the difficulty of constructing mechanistic models for a vector-borne pathogen with a multi-host sylvatic cycle that is still being characterized, coupled with a vector having a complex life-history incorporating multi-year time delays. West Nile virus exemplifies a different pattern, in which low-level scientific interest suddenly surges following incursions into new geographic territory (wealthy nations in particular), and sporadic modeling efforts follow a few years later.
 A sense of urgency and global risk motivates the community to produce and publish dynamical models quickly. Regrettably, for those zoonoses largely restricted to developing countries, such as trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), leishmaniasis, and leptospirosis, neglect still applies (Figs. 3B and Table S1) despite their substantial public health impacts. A further, essential factor is the existence of good clinical and epidemiological data to construct and validate models. Here we stress that data must be made publicly available, preferably in real time as occurred for SARS, to maximize both the research opportunity and the resulting public good of scientifically-derived policy. The early availability of genetic sequence data for the current H1N1 influenza pandemic has been exemplary in this regard, but unfortunately the corresponding epidemiological data have been less systematically accessible.
 Finally, a key determinant of modeling effort is pathogen life history-in particular the extent to which a pathogen matches the assumptions of the basic SIR family of epidemic models. For infections that are acute, symptomatic and directly-transmitted, models can be constructed (and often parameterized) using 'off-the-shelf' techniques, greatly speeding the analysis of newly identified disease threats and enabling extension of the models to address more sophisticated questions. Hence, an important priority for on-going research is to expand the class of pathogens for which there are readily available modeling templates, and worked examples of their connection to datasets, beyond those that conform easily to the standard SIR model.
 Significant shortfalls in dynamical studies of particular diseases, as well as entire classes of zoonotic pathogens (notably protozoan and vector-borne infections), can be clearly discerned in the literature (Fig. 3) . In contrast, some zoonoses, such as influenza, SARS and BSE, have acted as crucibles for development of new methods for understanding epidemiological complexities, particularly where well-resolved data are available. Unfortunately, even these models have been restricted in scope and there is a need for new models that integrate across phases of zoonotic dynamics and incorporate evolutionary, economic and within-host considerations.
 An especially worrying gap is modeling of spillover transmission from animals to humans. The force of infection across species boundaries can be broken into its constituent factors (Fig. 1B) , including universal components such as the role of human susceptibility, risk behaviors, and infection prevalence in the reservoir, as well as particular details related to transmission routes and pathogen-specific biology. Spillover risk also can be influenced by dynamical phenomena: one innovative study posits that epizootic peaks of hantavirus in rodent reservoirs, with accompanying spikes in numbers of newly-infected rodents excreting large quantities of virus, lead to high concentrations of virus in the environment and hence an increased risk of human infection (48) . Further research will reveal whether such hypotheses may hold true generally across zoonotic systems.
 Surprisingly, most of the best models of spillover have been developed for the more complex vector-borne and food-borne zoonoses; this arises because the process of transmission can often be observed directly in such systems. Studies of vector-borne infections have used quantitative frameworks to integrate data on host competency, vector feeding preferences, and environmental conditions to be able to estimate spillover risk from different ecological pathways, though without explicitly incorporating dynamics (49) . The food safety literature has treated the risk of pathogens crossing from animal hosts to human exposures in vivid mechanistic detail (50) , setting a high standard to be matched by disease ecologists. For directly-transmitted zoonoses, it is straightforward to construct a basic model with cross-species transmission (20) , but it is very challenging to delve into underlying mechanisms and estimate key parameters, particularly the cross-species contact rate and the resulting probability of infection, which typically arise from multiple and largely unobserved ecological, behavioral and physiological factors. Nevertheless, the plummeting cost of genetic sequencing brings exciting opportunities for mapping cross-species transmission (51).
 A second major gap lies in analysis of stuttering chains of inefficient human-to-human transmission following spillover. Data from these settings are dominated by stochastic effects and heterogeneities among hosts and environments, and analysis is complicated by the fundamental problem of distinguishing between primary and secondary cases. The central challenges in the study of stage III zoonoses include quantifying the rate of humanto-human transmission against a background of spillover, and monitoring for changes in pathogen transmissibility that may represent steps toward emergence of new stage IV pathogens (29) .
 The study of zoonotic dynamics offers a unique window into fundamental questions of pathogen ecology and evolution, and provides vital insights into public health issues. We need models to reveal the points of vulnerability where intervention against zoonoses will be most effective, and to highlight the gaps in data collection. We need to know when particular zoonotic phases, i.e., reservoir transmission, spillover from animals to humans, stuttering transmission or incipient outbreaks among humans, can be targeted to optimize epidemiological outcomes while reducing cost. How should health policy be adapted to account for environmental change or regional differences in ecology and sociology? How might zoonotic pathogens evolve in response to anthropogenic forces or control strategies? Dynamical models, rooted in data, provide an essential framework for addressing these critical questions. (A) Schematic diagram of zoonotic transmission dynamics. Zoonoses can involve as many as four dynamical phases, including enzootic or epizootic circulation in the animal reservoir, spillover transmission from animals to humans, and sometimes self-limiting stuttering chains of human-to-human transmission or sustained transmission leading to outbreaks. Adapting Wolfe et al. (6) , we classify zoonotic pathogens into three stages (II, III, and IV) according to their transmissibility among humans. (B) The spillover force of infection is determined by the product of three major components. The force of infection is defined as the per capita rate of infection of susceptible humans. Beneath each major component is a list of contributing factors drawn from many disciplines; these factors may pertain to all zoonoses or to particular transmission modes, as indicated. Dynamical models for epidemics. (A) Schematic diagram of the basic SIR model, showing progression of hosts from susceptible to infected to recovered states. The dotted arrows represent transmission of infection to new cases resulting from contacts between susceptible and infected individuals. (B) The simple epidemic curve (red) predicted by the SIR model for a closed population (i.e., without renewal by immigration or birth of new hosts) and R 0 > 1. The curves for the declining proportion of hosts that are susceptible to infection is black and for the rising proportion that are recovered and immune is blue. (C) Dynamical models provide unique insights and allow researchers to ask questions that cannot be addressed by other methods. For example, these models enable estimation of epidemiological parameters linked to key mechanisms, integration of data spanning multiple spatial scales, comparison of alternative control strategies, prediction of future trends, and explanation of observed patterns based on mechanistic hypotheses.

C.; Dobson, Andrew P.; Hudson, Peter J.; Grenfell, Bryan T.",Science,10.1126/science.1177345,Science,1058.0,True,"Knowledgeable observers operating within a legitimate framework for the public good have expressed divergent opinions about the importance and public safety implications of two papers, one recently published 1 and one soon-to-be published 2 , describing the production of ferret-transmissible H5N1 influenza viruses, and about related influenza transmission and pathogenesis research [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . How do these assumptions hold up against scientific data? Countless influenza A viruses circulate globally in a reservoir that consists of hundreds of avian species. Rarely, one of these viruses undergoes changes that enable it to switch hosts to infect mammals, including humans, although it is not clear whether human transmission can result directly from adaptation of an avian influenza virus (this has not been documented to occur), or only indirectly via further adaptation of pre-existing human or mammalian-adapted viruses, the mechanism that has been associated with all known pandemic and seasonal viruses after 1918. However, because avian influenza viruses have adapted to other mammals, it is considered plausible that such an emergence could occur in humans. Much H5N1 research of this type has already been published, including viral genetic engineering to evaluate properties such as pathogenicity and transmissibility in ferrets and other animal models. In the context of this published research literature, we comment on questions relevant to the two papers under discussion 1,2 . Solely on the basis of publicly available information about pathogenicity of intranasally inoculated H5N1 virus (the model for natural human and animal infection), the laboratoryderived H5N1 viruses produced in the two papers under discussion 1,11-15 do not have enhanced pathogenicity in ferrets compared to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, which is considered to be mildly pathogenic for humans 14, 15 . As documented since the 1940s 16 , intratracheal inoculation of influenza viruses is not a 'model' for natural viral pathogenicity; influenza viruses that are otherwise considered to be of low pathogenicity often induce severe and even fatal disease in animals when administered by this route, including the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus 15 . No evidence has yet been presented to support this, although the possibility that additional unspecified genetic changes might do so cannot be excluded. It is questionable to what extent HPAI H5N1 is adapted to, or capable of adapting to, humans. It may be that the human cases are a result of unusual high-dose exposures or rare individual genetic susceptibilities. Ferrets are thus an imperfect model for predicting human infectivity or transmissibility, let alone the high level of transmissibility characteristic of pandemic spread. Moreover, because determinants of viral pathogenicity may be lost upon adaptation to a new host, H5N1 viruses, whether or not transmissible, do not always cause severe disease in ferrets or non-human primates [45] [46] [47] . For these reasons viral phenotypes observed in animal models like the ferret may not predict what would happen in humans. Such insights can provide valuable clues in designing countermeasures against deadly epidemics and pandemics. Case fatality refers to fatal cases divided by all fatal plus non-fatal cases combined.) Given intense poultry and other exposures in many study areas, these low rates at first seem perplexing, especially when compared to the much higher seroprevalence rates in humans for other avian influenza viruses such as H9N2 (ref. On the other hand, rapid disappearance of human H5N1 vaccineinduced antibody 64 suggests that the opposite problem of false negatives could be occurring and, if so, might be especially problematic in cross-sectional studies in which the time since infection is not known, and which could in some cases be long enough for antibody titres to wane to sub-threshold or undetectable levels. Given such confusing information, there has been little agreement so far on the important question of asymptomatic and undetected H5N1 infections. Similar recalculations of other data would yield far lower rates, and wider seroprevalence studies would undoubtedly lower case-fatality rates even further. Even so, it should be remembered that limited spread of a deadly H5N1 virus, or pandemic H5N1 spread associated with a far lower case-fatality rate, would still be of public health concern. This widely available body of published research complicates determination of what to do with these two and with similar research manuscripts that seem likely to continue to appear. Withholding or redacting them does not prevent anyone from piecing together the basic information that they contain. As novel pathogens emerge, scientists must be able to continue to work with them safely and appropriately in teams using the talents of many highly trained researchers. Few disagree that it is crucial to continue research with H5N1 and other emerging infections, including investigation of how emerging pathogens adapt to new hosts and cause disease. However, it is important to ask whether some types of infectious diseases research should not be done, or not published openly. Even with the eventual publication of the two H5N1 studies, questions about how such research should be approved, evaluated and made public remain unanswered 83, 84 . Continued discussion and decisions about how to deal with this research will be of importance to scientific progress and public health. H5N1 is only one of many avian influenza viruses. If, as we believe existing data suggest, pathways to human adaptation are many, virus-specific, and with few common denominators, it will be important to study not just H5N1 but a wide range of avian and mammalian-and human-adapted viruses, including studies that feature backward genetic engineering to remove phenotypic determinants of adaptation, studies in nonhuman primates and, when safe and appropriate to do so, in human challenge studies 88 . In the latter case, important findings already have markedly enhanced our understanding of the emergence, transmissibility and pathogenicity of that important virus, helping us to prepare for and respond to the emergence of other influenza viruses. All of this work has been done safely with appropriate oversight, and without negative consequences. In moving forward we need to be safety conscious and to have consensus safety measures and policies in place, while at the same time using all available tools to seek broad understanding about the complex relationships between viruses and hosts. In reconsidering the proper balance between progress and safety, the critical importance of advancing scientific knowledge needs to be kept front and centre."

The ecological and evolutionary dynamics of pathogens play out on a wide range of interconnected temporal, organizational, and spatial scales that span hours to months, cells to ecosystems, and local to global spread. Some pathogens are directly transmitted between individuals of a single species, whereas others circulate among multiple hosts, need arthropod vectors, or persist in environmental reservoirs. Many factors, including increasing antimicrobial resistance, human connectivity, population growth, urbanization, environmental and land-use change, as well as changing human behavior, present global chal-lenges for prevention and control. Faced with this complexity, mathematical models offer valuable tools for understanding epidemiological patterns and for developing and evaluating evidence for decision-making in global health.
 ADVANCES: During the past 50 years, the study of infectious disease dynamics has matured into a rich interdisciplinary field at the intersection of mathematics, epidemiology, ecology, evolutionary biology, immunology, sociology, and public health. The practical challenges range from establishing appropriate data collection to managing increasingly large volumes of information. The theoretical challenges require fundamental study of many-layered, non-linear systems in which infections evolve and spread and where key events can be governed by unpredictable pathogen biology or human behavior. In this Review, we start with an examination of real-time outbreak response using the West African Ebola epidemic as an example. Here, the challenges range from underreporting of cases and deaths, and missing information on the impact of control measures to understanding human responses. The possibility of future zoonoses tests our ability to detect anomalous outbreaks and to estimate human-to-human transmissibility against a backdrop of ongoing zoonotic spillover while also assessing the risk of more dangerous strains evolving. Increased understanding of the dynamics of infections in food webs and ecosystems where host and nonhost species interact is key. Simultaneous multispecies infections are increasingly recognized as a notable public health burden, yet our understanding of how different species of pathogens interact within hosts is rudimentary. Pathogen genomics has become an essential tool for drawing inferences about evolution and transmission and, here but also in general, heterogeneity is the major challenge. Methods that depart from simplistic assumptions about random mixing are yielding new insights into the dynamics of transmission and control. There is rapid growth in estimation of model parameters from mismatched or incomplete data, and in contrasting model output with realworld observations. New data streams on social connectivity and behavior are being used, and combining data collected from very different sources and scales presents important challenges.
 All these mathematical endeavors have the potential to feed into public health policy and, indeed, an increasingly wide range of models is being used to support infectious disease control, elimination, and eradication efforts.
 OUTLOOK: Mathematical modeling has the potential to probe the apparently intractable complexity of infectious disease dynamics. Coupled to continuous dialogue between decisionmakers and the multidisciplinary infectious disease community, and by drawing on new data streams, mathematical models can lay bare mechanisms of transmission and indicate new approaches to prevention and control that help to shape national and international pub- T hirty-five years ago, it was believed that the health burden of infectious diseases was close to becoming insignificant as hygiene, improved nutrition, drugs, and vaccines brought about a steady decline in overall mortality (1). In recent decades, however, it has become clear that the threat from serious infectious diseases will persist, and human mortality attributed to infection is projected to remain at current levels of 13 to 15 million deaths annually until at least 2030 (2) . Successes in eradicating smallpox and rinderpest have been isolated events in a landscape of endemic and epidemic infections (3) . Newly emerging infectious agents represent a continuing challenge-for example, HIV in the 20th century; more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses; West Nile Virus; Nipah virus; drugresistant pathogens; novel influenza A strains; and a major Ebola virus outbreak in 2014-2015.
 Most new infections enter the human population from wildlife or livestock, and the possibilities for emergence and spread in the coming decades are likely to increase as a result of population growth, increased urbanization and land changes, greater travel, and increased livestock production to meet demands from the world's expanding population (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . In our modern world of instant communication, the changing behavior of individuals in response to publicity about epidemics can have profound effects on the course of an outbreak (9, 10) . Phylogenetic data shed light on an additional layer of complexity (11), as will increased understanding of the human genome in relation to susceptibility, infectiousness, and its duration. At the same time, the development of effective new vaccines remains a difficult challenge, especially for antigenically very variable pathogens (e.g., HIV or falciparum malaria) and for pathogens that stimulate immunity that is only partly protective (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or temporary (e.g., Vibrio cholerae).
 In the face of this complexity, computational tools (Box 1) are essential for synthesizing information to understand epidemiological patterns and for developing and weighing the evidence base for decision-making. Here, we review the contribution of these tools to our understanding of infectious disease dynamics for public health by using representative examples and by ranging into current developments. We argue that to improve decision-making for human health and for sustaining the health of our food systems, experts on infectious disease dynamics and experts on prevention and control need to collaborate on a global scale. To succeed, quantitative analysis needs to lie at the heart of public health policy formulation.
 The value of mathematical models to investigate public health policy questions was recog-nized at least 250 years ago when, in 1766, Daniel Bernoulli published a mathematical analysis of the benefits of smallpox inoculation (then called variolation) (12) . In the past 50 years, the study of infectious disease dynamics has grown into a rich interdisciplinary field. For example, decisionmaking for vaccination strategies increasingly depends on model analyses in which infection dynamics are combined with cost data (Box 2, Influenza: prevention and control). In recent decades, responses to major infectious disease outbreaks, including HIV, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), SARS, and pandemic and avian influenza, have shown both the need for and capabilities of models (Box 3, HIV: Test and treat strategy). Model-based analysis of such outbreaks also continually brings improvements in methodology and data, emerging from the comparison of model prediction with observed patterns.
 For infectious agents important to public health, a series of principles has emerged for modeling infection dynamics (Table 1 and Box 4). The basic reproduction number R 0 , for example, is a central concept characterizing the average number of secondary cases generated by one primary case in a susceptible population. This concept highlights what must be measured to interpret observed disease patterns and to quantify the impact of selected control strategies (Fig. 1) .
 Two fundamental properties of the world that shape infectious disease dynamics make computational tools key for understanding reality. The world is essentially a stochastic and highly RESEARCH SCIENCE sciencemag.org 13 nonlinear system. The nonlinearity derives not only from the complex interaction between factors involved in transmission, but also from the influence that the infection process has on the distribution of important characteristics at various temporal and spatial scales. This effect is seen in the age-related nature of infection and mortality in HIV changing the age distribution of the population, and in previous exposure to strains of influenza altering the distribution of influenza susceptibility. Such feedback mechanisms contribute to the nonlinearity of infection processes. Nonlinearity also leads to counterintuitive phenomena (Fig. 2) and prevents simple extrapolation of experience from one situation to another, such as when deciding whether to implement a vaccination policy in different countries (Fig. 1) . Mathematical tools, relating to data and processes on a large range of interacting scales, have become essential to explore, anticipate, understand, and predict the effects of feedbacks within such complex systems, including changes caused by intervention.
 Over the past decade, key public health questions, ranging from emergence to elimination, have posed a range of challenges for modeling infectious disease dynamics, many of which rely on leveraging disparate data sources and integrating data from a range of scales from genomics to global circulation. Given commonalities in processes across pathogens, progress made in one area can lead to advances in another. Progress in the areas described above all build on and inform each other, making this a dynamic time for research in the discipline (13) . A few themes are chosen to illustrate current trends in model development and public health application.
 The 2014-2015 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa serves to highlight both opportunities and challenges in modeling for public health. In the initial phase of this outbreak, real-time estimates of the reproduction number or simple exponential extrapolation (14) allowed short-term predictions of epidemic growth that were used, for example, to plan for necessary bed capacity. Quantitative phylogenetic tools applied to samples from initial victims provided important estimates of the origin of the outbreak (15) . Early mechanistic models that explicitly took into account the roles played by different transmission routes or settings were informed by analysis of earlier outbreaks (16, 17) . When the failure to contain the epidemic with methods successful in previous outbreaks led to a scale-up of capacity driven by international aid, such models were used to assess the impact of, for example, reducing transmission at funerals (17) and whether the construction of novel types of treatment centers could end up doing more harm than good. Ensuring that the most effective combinations of interventions were implemented required close and fast interaction between modelers and policymakers (18) . Looking forward, models are now used to help clinical trial design and inform a debate on the optimal deployment of initially scarce Ebola vaccines, once such vaccines become available.
 With the opportunities of real-time modeling for public health come specific challenges. The imperative to produce reliable and meaningful analysis for those treating infected people has to be balanced against the pressures and delays of scientific publication. In an ongoing outbreak, data can be patchy and reporting delayed, and different data sources are not always synthesized. When the Ebola outbreak expanded explosively in the summer of 2014, data were often lacking on the effect on transmission dynamics of the various control measures that operated simultaneously in the hectic circumstances of the most severely hit areas. In any emerging epidemic, underreporting is a critical challenge for ongoing assessment of this epidemic and has had enormous impact on predictions of outbreak size, but also of outbreak impact-for example, in terms of the case-fatality ratio (the proportion of cases that lead to death). Early in any outbreak, this estimate of severity can suffer from imprecise information on both the numerator (if not all deaths due to the infection are identified as such; for example, because health services are overwhelmed caring for the sick) and the denominator (if cases are not reported or, conversely, noncases get reported as cases if they are not laboratory-confirmed). This caused problems early in the H1N1 influenza outbreak first reported in in Mexico in 2009, as well as in the current Ebola outbreak. Although level of underreporting can be estimated from retrospective serological studies, it is usually not identifiable in real-time data.
 These limitations make it almost impossible to make reliable long-term predictions. Thus, modeling results are often based on scenarios in which a pathogen spreads unaltered by behavioral changes or the public health response. This rarely reflects reality, especially in such a devastating outbreak as Ebola, where the situation constantly changes owing to growing awareness in the community, as well as national and international intervention. Careful communication of findings is key, and data and methods of analysis (including code) must be made freely available to the wider research community. Only in this way can reproducibility of analyses and an open exchange of methods and results be ensured for maximal transparency and benefit to public health.
 There is an ever-present hazard that novel human pathogens emerge from livestock and wild aaa4339-2 13 Here, we use the words ""computational tools"" loosely. In infectious disease dynamics, there is a broad range of relevant quantitative tools, and we refer to the entire collection. It comprises statistical methods for inference directly from data, including methods to analyze sequencing and other genetic data. This leads to estimates of important epidemiological information such as length of latency, incubation and infectious periods and their statistical distributions, inferred transmission chains and trees early in outbreaks, the risks related to various transmission routes, or estimates of rates of evolution. Mathematical models in the strict sense refer to mathematical descriptions of processes thought to be associated with the dynamics of infection-for example, in a population or within an individual. Such models take many forms, depending on the level of biological knowledge of processes involved and data available, and depending on the purpose. Several classes of model are used, spanning the spectrum of information available. At one end of the range are detailed individual-based simulation models, where large numbers of distinct individual entities (with their own characteristic traits such as age, spatial location, sex, immune status, risk profile, or behavior pattern) are described in interaction with each other, possibly in a contact network, and with the infectious agent. At the other end are compartmental models where no individuals are recognized, but only states for individuals (for example: susceptible, infectious, immune) aggregated into compartments where everyone has the same average characteristics and where interaction is typically uniform (everybody interacts with everybody else). Such models do not describe the disease history of single individuals, but rather the time evolution of aggregated variables, such as the number of individuals that are currently susceptible.
 Mathematical models can have both mechanistic parts in their description, based on assumptions about biological mechanisms involved, and more phenomenological parts, where there is a statistical or presumed relation between variables, without clear assumptions from which this relation can be derived. An example of the former is the assumption of mass action to describe interaction between individual hosts; an example of the latter is an empirical relation between the length of an infectious period in a mosquito and environmental temperature.
 For infectious disease dynamics, our world is clearly stochastic, in that chance events play a role in many of the processes involved. Certainly at lower levels of biological aggregation, chance dominatesfor example, in infection of individual cells or in contacts individual hosts make. At higher aggregation levels, many cells or individuals interact, and chance effects may average out to allow deterministic descriptions. There are purely stochastic models, purely deterministic models, and models that are mixed. It is important to point out that, even though the world is stochastic, stochastic descriptions are not by definition better than deterministic descriptions. Both are still models of reality, and the fact that chance plays a role may have a far less significant influence on model outcome and prediction than choices made in the relations between ingredients and variables.
 Areas of rapid growth are statistical and numerical methods and tools to estimate model parameters from, often scarce, mismatched or incomplete data, and to contrast model output with real-world observations. mammal and bird reservoirs. Research on potential emerging zoonoses draws on concepts from across the spectrum of infectious disease dynamics, disease ecology, microbiology, and phylogenetic analysis. Particular challenges include estimating human-to-human transmissibility against a backdrop of ongoing zoonotic spillover, detecting anomalous outbreaks, and assessing the risk that more dangerous strains may arise through pathogen evolution.
 The recently identified gap in methodology for zoonoses with weak human-to-human transmission (6) is being filled with new approaches for estimating R 0 and other transmission-related quantities from subcritical outbreak data (19) (20) (21) . These studies address key public health concerns, but rely on strong assumptions regarding the quality and completeness of case observations. Better information on surveillance program efficacy could be gained through serological surveys (where blood and saliva samples reveal evidence of past and present infections) or sociological study, and modeling studies can help to design and characterize efficient surveillance programs (22) . Given the predominance of zoonotic pathogens among emerging infections, models for transmission dynamics and evolution in multispecies ecosystems and food webs (consisting of host species and nonhost species interacting ecologically and epidemiologically) are a crucial area for future development (6, 23) . The greatest challenge-and the greatest prize-in modeling emerging zoonoses is to assess which diseases pose the most risk to humans and how these might change over time and in different localities (24) . Such tasks, which will join molecular studies to experimental infections to epidemiological and ecological surveys, will drive empirical and theoretical efforts for decades to come.
 The rising availability of pathogen genome sequence data, coupled with new computational methods, presents opportunities to identify with precision ""who infects whom"" and the networks of infection between humans and reservoirs (25) . Full realization of this potential, though, will require denser and more systematic whole-genome sampling of pathogens coupled with associated epidemiological data, as well as baseline information on genetic diversity and evolutionary rates, especially in animal hosts (26).
 As pathogen genetic data become increasingly available, modelers are finding ways to synthesize these new data streams with more traditional epidemiological information in phylodynamic tools (27, 28) . However, current frameworks employ compartmental epidemiological models, which do not make efficient use of individuallevel epidemiological data. Although sampling theory is well developed for standard surveillance data, the relationship between a set of pathogen sequences and the phylogeny inferred from a population sample is more complex (11) . Many-to-one mapping possibilities between, on the one hand, combinations of epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes shaping sequences and, on the other hand, the inferred phylogeny, demand the integration of diverse data sources and an increased focus on systematic sampling.
 Phylodynamic studies to date have largely focused on fast-evolving RNA viruses, driven by the large amount of data generated for clinical [e.g., hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HIV)] or surveillance (e.g., influenza) purposes (11) . Replicating these efforts on an expanded array of pathogens, including DNA viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa (e.g., malaria), and helminths, is a promising avenue for future research (29) . It is of particular importance in the context of the evolution and spread of drug-resistant variants and vaccine escape mutants. However, genomewide pathogen data also present challenges, in particular in relation to accommodating recombination, reassortment, and mobile genetic elements. Analysis of bacterial genomes usually considers only those genes that are shared across taxa, but there are good reasons to believe that noncore (127) . Application of a nonlinear age-structured SIR model (see Box 4) to these circumstances led to the collection of key missing data. In the bottom right-hand plot, each square depicts a combination of birth rate and infant vaccine coverage reflecting different countries (e.g., Somalia depicted by a diamond and Nepal by a circle), colored by expected effect on congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in newborns, related to local R 0 (128). This translates into confidence that routine vaccination is likely to reduce the public health burden caused by CRS in Nepal (green), but not in Somalia (red).

 Although sequence data are extremely valuable, to link these data fully to disease dynamics, it will be important to determine how sequence changes affect functions related to pathogen fitness, such as replication rate, transmissibility, and immune recognition. Molecular epidemiological studies often treat pathogen genetic variation as simply reflecting the underlying transmission process, whereas in reality such variation may play an important role in determining transmission dynamics, as exemplified by escape from herd immunity by influenza A virus (31) .
 ""Deep"" sequencing of pathogens within individual hosts generates information on withinhost diversity, resulting from evolution within the host (often in response to drug treatment), or multiple infections. To tackle within-host diversity, models that embed pathogen evolution within a transmission tree are needed. Such models, which cross the within-and between-host scales, are only just becoming analytically and computationally feasible despite being proposed several years ago (32) . Similarly, although progress has been made in scaling inference from genes to genomes (33) , scaling inference to large numbers of sequences is lagging far behind. (132) ]. In the presence of resistance, focusing treatment on the high-risk core group leads to an increase in prevalence approaching that of untreated baseline prevalence, after an initially strong decline for more than a decade.

 Infectious disease epidemiology evolved by focusing on interactions between a single host species and a single infectious agent. It is becoming increasingly clear that multiple agents simultaneously infecting the same host populations and individuals appreciably add to the public health burden and complicate prevention and control. Coinfections in relation to HIV-for example, tuberculosis and HCV-or coinfection of different strains of influenza A virus raise important public health and evolutionary issues. Multiple agents infecting the same host individual have been shown to influence each other by increasing or decreasing susceptibility and/or infectivity of that individual, thereby influencing the population dynamics of these agents in ways that we have yet to explore and understand (34, 35) .
 Multiple infections of the same individual with closely related pathogens occur when infection elicits no immunity, or only a partial immune response. Macroparasites, including many of the important human helminth infections, are good examples of pathogens that evade human immune responses and cause repeated infection of the same host (36) . Biological mechanisms giving rise to such multiple infections include sequential reinfections caused by antigenic drift in influenza, antigenic variation in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and waning (slow loss of) immunity in pertussis, while lack of cross-protection in many colonizing microparasites-for example, pneumococcus and human papilloma virus (HPV)-allows for multiple concurrent infections. Although the existence of reinfections is a clinical fact, population-level data are scarce as reinfections are often subclinical and individualbased longitudinal infection histories are often only anecdotal. Results from new analytical approaches relating to deep sequencing and neutralization tests covering multiple antigens are being utilized (37) .
 The immunodynamics of influenza have clear policy implications for the identification of highrisk groups in connection with pandemic planning (38) , while the dynamics of waning immunity are key to the current concerns about immunization level for pertussis (39) . Multivalent vaccines covering only a targeted subset from the circulating strains of pneumococcus and HPV pose important new applied problems (40) . The spread of recombinant viruses implies the existence of multiple infections. One example is the Sydney 2012 strain of norovirus, but how this can occur in such an acute infection remains to be understood, as the time window for multiple exposures is limited, unless subclinical or environmental reservoirs of infection are important. Mathematical models could help to explore how, for example, such subpopulations may contribute to the dynamics of multiple infections.
 Human behavior is a fundamental determinant of infectious disease dynamics, whether by affecting how people come in contact with each other, vaccination coverage, reporting biases, or adherence to treatment. Traditional epidemic models have tended to ignore heterogeneity in contact behavior [although early HIV models addressed heterogeneity in sexual behavior by necessity (41) ]. Increasing sophistication of contact network models (42) , together with data on epidemiological contacts, creates opportunities for understanding and controlling transmission at a fundamental level (43) and opens up the possibility of independent study of relevant social factors (10) . Recent years have seen exciting developments in the measurement of contact patterns and ""who might infect whom"" through advances in individual electronic identification technology. This is a promising avenue for linking pathogen genetic data and human behavior.
 Contact patterns are not static and can shift during outbreaks as individuals change their be-havior in response to perceived risk and public health interventions (44) . Modeling has illuminated this process-for example, by the incorporation of peer influence on vaccination behavior into models of infectious disease dynamics (45, 46) . Analysis of data from online social networks has also created promising opportunities to validate such approaches with empirical observations (47, 48) .
 Movement and travel are tightly linked to the spread of infection and have been explored through models to highlight commuting and agricultural migration driving local disease transmission (49) and global disease patterns through air travel (50) . These processes are now being investigated to gain insights into the more complex case of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue, where both host and vector movement SCIENCE sciencemag.org 13 Human influenza-pandemic and seasonal-remains a major issue in public health owing to the continued emergence of novel genetic strains, and one where models have successfully addressed questions from basic biology to epidemiology and health policy. In recent years, modeling and other quantitative analysis has been used to study at least three major issues: pandemic preparedness and mitigation strategies (84) (85) (86) (87) (88) (89) , rethinking vaccination strategies for seasonal influenza (70) , and improved methods in phylodynamics and influenza strain evolution (11) . Recent models of influenza fitness have also been developed to predict viral evolution from one year to the next, providing a principled and more precise method for the vaccine selection required every year (90) .
 For seasonal influenza, models have played a key role in providing the scientific evidence base for vaccination policy, making use of the information in multiple, often unavoidably biased, data sources such as syndromic time series, vaccine coverage and efficacy, economic costs, and contact patterns in the population. For example, a combined epidemic and economic model was fitted to fine-grained data from many sources to describe the dynamics of influenza in the United Kingdom, and the influence of previous vaccination programs (70) . With confidence in the model's predictions based on its ability to capture past patterns, it was used to look at alternative vaccination strategies and led to a new national policy to vaccinate school-age children (91) . Targeting those individuals most likely to spread the virus, rather than only those most likely to suffer the largest morbidity, is a marked departure from established practice in the UK and is currently under consideration elsewhere (92) .
 Mathematical modeling has played a central role in our understanding of the HIV epidemic, and in informing policy from the outset of our recognition of the pandemic (93) . Some of the many insights include a model-based analysis of viral load data from inhibition experiments, which revealed the rapid and ongoing turnover of the within-host viral population (94) , and the use of phylogenetic models to show that the HIV pandemic did not emerge in the 1980s, but had its roots in the early 20th century (95) .
 A key contribution of mathematical modeling has been to identify when viral transmission occurs over the course of infection, which determines the potential to halt spread by various measures. Models have shown that transmission of HIV depends on the epidemic phase and the sexual behavior of the population, and a large proportion of transmissions may occur late in infection (96) . Model-based inference in the Netherlands also suggested that the effective reproduction number (Box 4) had fallen below 1 due to a combination of low-risk behavior and a very effective diagnosis and treatment program (97) . The debate was transformed in the mid-2000s, when eradication of HIV through a ""test and treat"" strategy was hypothesized (98, 99) . Subsequent trial results showing that antiretroviral treatment (ART) of HIV-positive individuals could practically eliminate transmission within sexual partnerships when the index case is treated (100) have further supported the role of treatment as prevention. Although these findings have not dispelled concerns about transmission early in infection (93) , or about extra-couple transmission (101) , it is suggested that high population coverage of ART may have reduced the incidence of HIV infection in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (102) .
 These findings, combined with the prospect of cheaper, more effective drugs and delivery structures, underpin UNAIDS' goal of ""zero new infections"" for HIV and the initiation of a multimillion dollar cluster-randomized trial (103) , which will have its outcome assessed against model predictions. In the meantime, the scientific discussion of the effectiveness of ART in preventing transmission continues, sparked by studies that fail to show a decline in incidence after increased treatment (104) . Such debates are essential to elucidate areas for improvement of the models used and data needs for such improvement, and to highlight methodological limitations (105) .
 on April 21, 2016 http://science.sciencemag.org/ can interact to drive local (51) and large-scale dynamics (52) .
 Modeling has long provided support for elimination efforts: Vector control (53), critical community size (54), herd immunity, and critical vaccination threshold (55, 56) were all powerful insights from models framed in relatively simple and homogeneous terms. Subtleties and complexities in many current eradication programs, as well as the availability of novel data sources, have called for a range of extensions in the theory. As we approach elimination targets, disease dynamics have changed in ways that were largely predicted by models, but also in unanticipated ways as a result of ignorance about key epidemiological processes (3).
 Incentives for control efforts also change, both at the individual level [passive or active refusal to participate can develop (57) ] and at the country level (58) . This reinforces the call for development of models of human behavior and its interaction with infectious disease dynamics (9) aaa4339-6 13 MARCH 2015 • VOL 347 ISSUE 6227 sciencemag.org SCIENCE Table 1 .

 potentially drawing on new data sources from social media (59, 60) , as well as for models that can capture national and nongovernmental motivations, interactions, and competition, economical or otherwise. Long-term control puts pathogens under strong selection for resistance, calling for evolution-proof control methods (61) and novel vaccine technologies and their optimized delivery (62) . Finally, since the era of smallpox eradication, patterns of global disease circulation have changed radically. Human mobility and migration are increasing global connectivity, strengthening the need for cooperation and international synchronization of efforts (as illustrated by polio). Techniques for analysis of novel data sources are again key here; e.g., mobile phone records provide unique opportunities to understand disease source-sink dynamics (52) .
 By definition and design, models are not reality. The properties of stochasticity and nonlinearity strongly influence the accuracy of absolute predictions over long time horizons. Even if the mechanisms involved are broadly understood and relevant data are available, predicting the exact future course of an outbreak is impossible owing to changes in conditions in response to the outbreak itself, and because of the many chance effects in play. These stochastic effects dominate developments in situations with relatively few infected individuals that occur at emergence, approaching the threshold for sustained hosthost spread, or approaching elimination and eradication. This makes it virtually impossible to predict which infectious disease agent is going to emerge and evolve next and where, or to predict when and where the next or last case in an outbreak will occur. There is, typically in complex systems, a fundamental horizon beyond which accurate prediction is impossible. The field has yet to explore where that horizon is and whether computational tools and additional data (and if so which data) can stretch predictions to this limit. In contrast, ""what-if"" scenarios for public health intervention can provide qualitative (and increasingly semiquantitative) insight into their population consequences.
 With growing applications in public health, there is an increasing demand to validate models by making model predictions consistent with observed data. The development of ever-morepowerful computers is accompanied by new techniques utilizing this power, notably for statistically rigorous parameter estimation and model comparison. Techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) have become firmly established tools for parameter estimation from data in infectious disease models [e.g., (63) ], and Monte Carlo based methods will play a pivotal role in addressing the challenges that lie in reconciling predictions and observations (64, 65) . Other techniques, such as so-called particle filters, approximate Bayesian computation, emulation, and their combinations with MCMC [e.g., (66) ], are rapidly developing and allow stochastic models that explicitly account for incomplete observations to be matched to time series of cases, giving insights into scenarios as diverse as cholera in Bangladesh (67) and influenza (68, 69) . The need to integrate multiple data sources (70, 71) , as well as to include uncertainty in model parameters and/ or structure, has driven the use of Bayesian approaches.
 Although the rapid expansion of infectious disease models and their application over the past decade has coincided with an increase in open access data sets available from a variety of sources, progress in data capture needs to be accelerated. Although some of these technologically advanced data streams have been incorporated into models-for example, to track the incidence of influenza in the United States (72), to elucidate the spatial dynamics of measles and malaria in Africa (53, 73) , and to chart the spread of dengue globally (74)-much more remains to be done to leverage data collected from different sources (e.g., demographic, genetic, epidemiological, treatment, and travel patterns) and at different temporal and spatial scales.
 Infectious diseases are an important frontier in public health, and their prevention and control call for global, rather than national or regional, coordinated efforts (75) (76) (77) (78) . The success of smallpox and rinderpest eradication campaigns shows the possibilities; the global spread of newly emerged pathogens (recently avian influenza strains and MERS coronavirus), the difficulties in curbing the spread of antibiotic resistance, the upsurge of polio toward the ""end-phase"" of its eradication, and the recent unprecedented spread of Ebola virus, are examples that show the need for international coordination and collaboration. Nonlinearity in infectious disease dynamics and global connectivity cause suboptimal national decisions on control and prevention to have regional and even global repercussions.
 Given the mismatch with regions where most expertise on infectious disease dynamics is concentrated, it is important to empower local scientists and policy-makers, in regions where the burden of disease is heaviest, about the problems facing their own countries and the consequences of local actions. It is essential to make expertise, data, models, statistical methods, and software widely available by open access. There are several initiatives (e.g., Thiswormyworld.org, Garkiproject.nd.edu, EDENextdata.com, the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), and the Malaria Atlas Project), but more needs to be done. Modeling tools and software for data analysis are beginning to become open source, such that findings can be replicated, additional scenarios can be evaluated, and others can incorporate methods for data analysis or simulation. Ultimately, sharing models guarantees more SCIENCE sciencemag.org 13 • susceptible: individual who is at risk of becoming infected if exposed to an infectious agent.
 • basic reproduction number, R 0 : average number of infections caused by a typical infected individual in a population consisting only of susceptibles; if R 0 > 1, the infectious agent can start to spread.
 • effective reproduction number, R e : average number of infections caused by a typical infected individual when only part of the population is susceptible; as long as R e > 1, the agent can continue to spread.
 • herd immunity: state of the population where the fraction protected is just sufficient to prevent outbreaks (R e < 1).
 • critical elimination threshold, p c : proportion of the susceptible population that needs to be successfully protected-for example, by vaccination-to achieve herd immunity; p c = 1: 1/R 0 is a rule of thumb from models when hosts are assumed to mix randomly.
 • force of infection: per capita rate at which susceptible individuals acquire infection.
 • final size: fraction of the initial susceptible population that eventually becomes infected during an outbreak.
 • prevalence: proportion of the population with infection or disease at a given time point.
 • superspreader/supershedder: infected individual that produces substantially more new cases than the average because of greater infectiousness, longer duration of infectiousness, many more transmission opportunities and contacts, or combinations of these. Even when the average R 0 is relatively small, these individuals have large effects on outbreaks.
 • metapopulation: collection of populations, separated in space, but connected through movement of individuals.
 • critical community size: minimum number of individuals in a population that allow an infectious agent to persist without importation of cases.
 • case fatality ratio: proportion of symptomatic infections that result in death.
 • SIR model: most basic model metaphor for immunizing infections where each living individual is assumed to be in one of three epidemiological states at any given time: susceptible, infected and infectious, and recovered and immune. The model specifies the rates at which individuals change their state. Individuals progress from S to I when infected, then from I to R upon recovery. Many variants exist-for example, recognizing different classes of S, I, and R individuals, depending on individual traits such as age.

 Making data sets widely available is also crucial, for example, to support replication of findings and broader comparative analyses (79) . As models become open access, so should much of the data collected by governments, international agencies, and epidemiology research groups. Two outbreaks never occur in exactly matching circumstances, even for the same infectious agent, so there is potential to study many outbreaks in parallel to gain insight into the determinants of outbreak pattern and severity. Looking forward, there is a major opportunity to design experiments, clinical trials [for example for vaccines (80) ], and surveillance protocols to test model predictions or assumptions, and to help reduce or better target the enormous costs involved. By integrating modeling approaches throughout the full life cycle of infectious disease policies, including economic considerations (58, 70, 81) , health outcomes can be improved and scientific understanding can be advanced.
 At present, the evidence provided by infectious disease models is not considered by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group (www. gradeworkinggroup.org) alongside that of conventional studies such as clinical trials. Regardless, models are essential when diverse sources of data (including GRADE-scale evidence) need to be combined and weighed to assess quality of evidence and recommendations made in health care scenarios. In many cases, the definitive trial cannot be performed, and in such circumstances models can offer insight and extract maximum value from data that are available. In recent years, uniformity of practice and quality control for models has received more attention, resulting in initial attempts to characterize good modeling practice for infectious diseases (82, 83) .
 The optimal use of models to inform policy decisions requires a continuous dialogue between the multidisciplinary infectious disease dynamics community and decision-makers. This is increasingly understood by governments in developed countries, in nongovernmental agencies and by large funding bodies. This dialogue will help to reduce the burden from infectious diseases by providing better-informed control strategies. Mathematical models will allow us to capitalize on new data streams and lead to an ever-greater ability to generate robust insight and collectively shape successful local and global public health policy.",e50f2aaaba8e77d2db138774cbbd8ee3739d3317,2015-03-12,"Heesterbeek, Hans; Anderson, Roy; Andreasen, Viggo; Bansal, Shweta; De Angelis, Daniela; Dye, Chris; Eames, Ken; Edmunds, John; Frost, Simon; Funk, Sebastian; Hollingsworth, Deirdre; House, Thomas; Isham, Valerie; Klepac, Petra; Lessler, Justin; Lloyd-Smith, James; Metcalf, Jessica; Mollison, Denis; Pellis, Lorenzo; Pulliam, Juliet; Roberts, Mick; Viboud, Cecile",Science,10.1126/science.aaa4339,Science,1058.0,True,"In the global human population, we report the emergence of 335 infectious diseases between 1940 and 2004. However, we find that the majority of pathogens involved in EID events are bacterial or rickettsial (54.3%). Viral or prion pathogens constitute only 25.4% of EID events, in contrast to previous analyses which suggest that 37-44% of emerging pathogens are viruses or prions and 10-30% bacteria or rickettsia 5, 8, 11 . This provides the first analytical support for previous suggestions that the threat of EIDs to global health is increasing 1,2,14 . To further investigate the peak in EID events in the 1980s, we examined the most frequently cited driver of EID emergence during this period (see Supplementary Table 1) . The majority (60.3%) of EID events are caused by zoonotic pathogens (defined here as those which have a non-human animal source), which is consistent with previous analyses of human EIDs 5, 8 . Our analysis reveals a significant rise in the number of EID events they have caused over time, controlling for reporting effort (GLM P,JID F = 49.8, P < 0.001, d.f. However, this controversial issue requires further analyses to test causal relationships between EID events and climate change 18 . We hypothesize that (1) socioeconomic drivers (such as human population density, antibiotic drug use and agricultural practices) are major determinants of the spatial distribution of EID events, in addition to the ecological or environmental conditions that may affect overall (emerging and non-emerging) human pathogen distribution 19 , and (2) that the importance of these drivers depends on the category of EID event. 2 ), and socioeconomic variables (human population density and human population growth), environmental variables (latitude, rainfall) and an ecological variable (wildlife host species richness) (see Methods). EID events caused by drug-resistant microbes are affected by human population density and growth, latitude and rainfall. However, until more rigorous global data sets of these drivers become available, data on human population density and growth act as reasonable proxies for such anthropogenic changes. A visualization of the regression results from Table 1 for EID events from each category (Fig. 3) , reflecting greater surveillance and infectious disease research effort in richer, developed countries of Europe, North America, Australia and some parts of Asia, than in developing regions. 1 , and recent reviews 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14 ) . Finally, our analysis suggests that efforts to conserve areas rich in wildlife diversity by reducing anthropogenic activity may have added value in reducing the likelihood of future zoonotic disease emergence. We account for these biases by quantifying reporting effort in JID and including it in our temporal and spatial analyses. JID is the premier international journal (highest ISI impact factor 2006: http://portal.isiknowledge.com/) of human infectious disease research that publishes papers on both emerging and non-emerging infectious diseases without a specific geographical bias. We carried out the spatial analyses using a multivariable logistic regression to control for co-variability between drivers, with the presence/absence of EID events as the dependent variable and all drivers plus our measure of spatial reporting bias by country as independent variables (n = 18,307 terrestrial grid cells). 2) 'Year' (the earliest year in which the first cluster of cases representing each EID event was reported to have occurred was taken where a range of years was given).

5,5,cb9c068090dd2df30473089f86c3e5aceb8e797d,,Social and biological contagions,"The coupling of social and biological contagion in human populations can have positive or negative outcomes.
 Despite the invention of control measures like vaccines, infectious diseases remain part of human existence. Ideas, sentiments or information can also be contagious (1,2). Such social contagion is akin to biological contagion-both spread through a replication process that is blind to the consequences for the individual, and if each person transmits to more than one person, the explosive power of exponential growth creates an epidemic. Social contagions may cause irrational ""fever"". Isaac Newton, having lost £20,000 in the speculative South Sea Bubble, commented that he could ""calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men"" (3). Systems where both types of contagion are coupled to one anotheran infectious disease spreading by biological contagion and a social contagion concerning the disease-offer unique scientific challenges and are increasingly important for public health (4-15).","Social contagions can exhibit complex dynamics, such as the tipping points and cascading instabilities observed in financial collapse (2) . Social contagion can be conceptualized as a network, where each node is a person, and the network links are social contacts through which the contagion can spread (see the figure, panel A). Infectious diseases can also exhibit complex dynamics and be conceptualized as a network through which the biological contagion spreads (see the figure, panel B).
 When a social contagion is coupled to a biological contagion, the resulting disease-behavior system can exhibit dynamics that do not occur when the two subsystems are uncoupled and in isolation from one another. This illustrates the lesson of complexity science that the whole is more than the sum of the parts (see the figure, panel C).
 For example, high levels of pediatric vaccine coverage can decrease disease incidence to very low levels, reducing the perceived danger of infection and hence the urgency to get vaccinated. Subsequently, if a highly connected node in the social contact network (such as celebrities or public health authorities) suggests the vaccine carries risks, the resulting perception of vaccine risks can propagate quickly through the social network, fueling a vaccine scare and a drop in vaccine coverage (biological contagion influences social contagion, see the figure, panel C).
 In turn, the drop in vaccine coverage allows the number of individuals who are susceptible to infection to accumulate. When the percentage of susceptible individuals exceeds a tipping point, an outbreak of infectious disease occurs, which may motivate individuals to once again seek vaccination (social contagion influences biological contagion, see the figure, panel C). This dynamic may have occurred during whole cell pertussis vaccine scare in the United Kingdom during the 1970s and the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine autism scare more recently (4) . Similarly, in some populations the advent of antiviral HIV drugs led to a rise in risky sexual behavior, and consequently a rise in sexually transmitted infections (5).
 However, social contagions can also produce positive consequences in disease-behavior systems. Social norms dictate that individuals should cover their mouth when sneezing. Parents often vaccinate their children because other parents around them do so. Altruism can also be an important motivator (6) . The Israeli Ministry of Health recently called for an additional dose of oral polio vaccine in children who were already vaccinated (and thus presumably protected), primarily to prevent infection in those who cannot get vaccinated due to weakened immune systems. Polio vaccine uptake soon exceeded the targets (7).
 Epidemic trajectories and the uptake of control measures can vary widely between populations. SARS-CoV caused large epidemics in some populations but almost no transmission in others (8) . Social differences between populations may be one reason for this. Control of SARS-CoV depended partly on population acceptance of quarantine and isolation, which is often determined by social norms. The role of disease-behavior interactions in outbreak heterogeneity has received little attention because of the difficulty of quantifying social feedbacks, but exploiting new sources of data such as online social media may help to address this (9) .
 The challenges of studying disease-behavior systems are generating interesting science. Mathematical modelers are exploring disease-behavior interactions not only in the context of vaccines but also for the emergence of antibiotic resistance and antiviral influenza drug resistance, as well as for social distancing, where people avoid contact with infected individuals (10) . Interest in behavior-disease interactions in the context of HIV vaccines and antiviral drugs is also returning after a spike of interest in the 1990s. Modelers are exploring how disease-behavior dynamics, such as population susceptibility to vaccine risk, vary with socioeconomic factors (11) .
 Mathematical modelers are constructing realistic models tailored to specific systems and public health research questions, and testing the empirical validity of those models (4, 6, 12). As part of this trend, increasing amounts of data on social contact networks are being collected in order to help formulate and test network-based disease-behavior models (9, 13) . Moreover, modelers are incorporating the insights of economists, sociologists and psychologists into disease-behavior models (4, 6, 10-13).
 Empirically validated disease-behavior models could be used, for example, as predictive tools to explore optimal strategies for public health intervention in response to a vaccine scare. Predicting ""the madness of men"" in disease-behavior systems may appear daunting. However, if social contagions have clear similarities to well-understood biological contagions that can be captured in models, and if the focus is on predicting aggregate population behavior rather than individual actions, predictive models may be feasible. Even an approximate ability to anticipate how populations will respond to new disease control measures could be helpful.
 Predictability in such systems appears to be possible. For example, some models predicted that cervical cancer vaccine uptake would be below recommended levels in the United States, which is what ended up occurring (12, 15) . Other models have retrospectively predicted vaccine coverage and endemic disease dynamics for historical pediatric vaccine scares (4) . Empirical validation of models could be facilitated by more long-term data on the determinants of control measure uptake in the specific context of disease-behavior systems. Also, the field must develop a common lexicon. For example, social contagion is often referred to differently even when the underlying mathematical formulation is identical. This can create confusion. We have much to learn from those who ""calculate the movement of stars""-astronomers routinely agree to standardize their nomenclature through committees.
 Vaccines and drugs for many long-established infectious diseases are becoming more widely available. Thus, population behavior may replace accessibility as the most challenging barrier to higher uptake of control measures. On the other hand, for many novel zoonoses like SARS-CoV, there are initially no pharmaceutical interventions. Hence, public health must rely on quarantine, movement restrictions, and other measures that require cooperative behavior. Also, where there is lack of epidemiological knowledge in the early stages of a new zoonosis, fear and supposition can easily rush in to fill the void. In all cases, an improved understanding of the interplay between social contagions and biological contagions will help to improve disease control efforts. When a social contagion on a social network (A) and a biological contagion on an infection contact network (B) are coupled to one another (C), the resulting interplay can create complex dynamics that are not present in either network layer in isolation, such as the fall and rise of vaccine coverage during a vaccine scare (4) . Each person 1, 2, 3, 4… is a node in both the social contagion network and the biological contagion network.",cb9c068090dd2df30473089f86c3e5aceb8e797d,2013-10-03,"Bauch, Chris T.; Galvani, Alison P.",Science,10.1126/science.1244492,Science,1058.0,True,"identify the priorities for future research that will unify, focus, and propel the interdisciplinary push to combat zoonoses. This quantity, defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infectious individual in a wholly susceptible population, is a central concept in epidemiological theory (14, 15) . R 0 enables us to distinguish stages II-IV on dynamical grounds since it quantitatively demarcates pathogens capable of sustained transmission among humans (those with R 0 >1) from those doomed to stutter to local extinction (R 0 <1) or those with no onward transmission (R 0 =0). The dynamics of all zoonoses involve multiple phases, including transmission in the animal reservoir, spillover transmission into humans, and possibly stuttering or sustained transmission among humans. Crucially, dynamical models explicitly represent the key population groups and central processes of epidemic spread. Transmission of infection to new cases is driven by contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals. Because of the emphasis on mechanism, dynamical models can address questions outside the scope of statistical and geospatial analyses (Fig. Models can also evaluate the potential influence of unknown information, helping to set priorities for data collection and define the uncertainty associated with model outcomes. Finally, dynamical models can be used to predict future trends of disease spread, although such projections must be accompanied by a comprehensive uncertainty analysis. Models of rabies transmission have provided biological insight, guided vaccination policy and predicted spatial spread (18) (19) (20) . Theoretical studies have illuminated central mechanisms relevant to zoonotic dynamics: analysis of the population dynamics of multi-host pathogens revealed the influence of host species diversity on reservoir dynamics and spillover risk (28) , while a hybrid transmission/evolution model showed the potential for stage III zoonoses to adapt to humans before their stuttering chains of transmission die out (29) . Models of both influenza and SARS have exposed the futility of imposing travel restrictions once a pathogen is already spreading within a region (e.g. 24, 33) , and such restrictions have been largely avoided following the recognition that the 2009 H1N1 influenza strain was already widespread when it was discovered. Where has modeling research concentrated across the gamut of zoonotic pathogens and epidemiological challenges? Bacterial and especially protozoan pathogens have received much less attention relative to their importance. Vector-borne and food-borne zoonoses have been neglected by dynamical modelers compared with infections transmitted by direct contact. The great majority of modeling studies consider just a single phase of the zoonotic process, typically focusing on dynamics in the reservoir or outbreaks in the human population (Fig. Models incorporating spillover transmission-the defining process of zoonotic dynamics-are dismayingly rare. For vector-borne and food-borne infections, this number is higher but still a clear minority. S2) , wherein zoonotic pathogens transmit inefficiently among humans so any minor outbreaks triggered by spillover events inevitably die out. Equally notable are the questions missing from these studies. While most studies use some data to parameterize or validate models (Fig. Models can also interact powerfully with population-level experiments to confirm mechanisms underlying observed patterns (44) . Detailed simulation models are necessary to address some important questions, but model complexity should be increased cautiously and with an awareness of the associated costs of reduced transparency, a multiplicity of often unknown parameters, and the resulting need for intensive investigation of how model assumptions may influence conclusions (e.g., 31). Given the prevailing focus of zoonotic models on designing and assessing control measures, and the unique potential of models to estimate important characteristics of epidemics, it is instructive to consider the timeliness with which modelers respond to emerging threats. 3B and Table S1) despite their substantial public health impacts. Here we stress that data must be made publicly available, preferably in real time as occurred for SARS, to maximize both the research opportunity and the resulting public good of scientifically-derived policy. An especially worrying gap is modeling of spillover transmission from animals to humans. Further research will reveal whether such hypotheses may hold true generally across zoonotic systems. A second major gap lies in analysis of stuttering chains of inefficient human-to-human transmission following spillover. We need to know when particular zoonotic phases, i.e., reservoir transmission, spillover from animals to humans, stuttering transmission or incipient outbreaks among humans, can be targeted to optimize epidemiological outcomes while reducing cost. Dynamical models, rooted in data, provide an essential framework for addressing these critical questions. ( B) The spillover force of infection is determined by the product of three major components. The force of infection is defined as the per capita rate of infection of susceptible humans. Beneath each major component is a list of contributing factors drawn from many disciplines; these factors may pertain to all zoonoses or to particular transmission modes, as indicated. The dotted arrows represent transmission of infection to new cases resulting from contacts between susceptible and infected individuals. ("

On March 31, 2013, Chinese health officials notified the World Health Organization of three cases of human infection with novel inf luenza A (H7N9). Since then, 132 people have been infected, 37 of them fatally (see figure, Panel A). To date, there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission. However, a number of characteristics of this virus are cause for heightened attention.
 First, the human population has not been exposed on a large scale to hemagglutinin 7 (H7) and neuraminidase 9 (N9) antigens in recent times and therefore most likely lacks immunity against this strain. Second, initial analyses of viral genome sequences suggest signs of adaptation to mammals -such as the ability to attach to respiratory tissue and to replicate at mammalian body temperatures 1 -which could facilitate human-to-human transmission. Third, because the virus has low pathogenicity in birds, its presence is difficult to detect in bird f locks by symptomatic surveillance alone. Testing of more than 20,000 people with inf luenza-like illness in China revealed only six cases of H7N9 infection, suggesting that there are not widespread mild cases of H7N9. 2 Public health officials on the ground continue to focus substantial resources on assessing and mitigating the pandemic potential of this virus strain. Although these efforts are critical for understanding the evolving public health situation, since there are limited resources available, intelligence for assessing the threat must come from a wide range of data sources. Though relatively new, digital disease surveillance is an increasingly powerful tool that complements traditional approaches. 3
 In this and other outbreaks, digital disease surveillance has supplemented the critical laboratory studies and work in the trenches by public health officials and epidemiologists, by leveraging widespread use of the Internet, mobile phones, and social media. 3 Many of these added insights come from the general population, whose access to technology enables rapid information f low.

 Digital data can be used in at least four ways for studying infectious-disease dynamics. First, they can be used for early detection of disease outbreaks. This capacity was illustrated most recently in China, when a hospital employee uploaded an image of the medical record of a patient with H7N9 infection to Sina Weibo, a popular Chinese social network similar to Twitter. The post was promptly deleted, but it appears to have accelerated the government's acknowledgment of four new cases (see figure, Panel B). More generally, because digital surveillance is not limited by the hierarchies of traditional public health infrastructure, geographic communication barriers, and geopolitical obstacles, it has improved the timeliness of outbreak detection substantially in recent years. 4 Second, these data can be used to continuously monitor disease levels. With proper filtering by automated systems (see the Journal's H7N9 HealthMap tracking system [http:// healthmap.org/h7n9]), analyst-driven systems (e.g., the Global Public Health Intelligence Network of Canada), vigilant journalists on Twitter (e.g., Crawford Kilian [@Crof ] and Helen Branswell [@HelenBranswell]), and crowd-sourced systems (e.g., FluTrackers and ProMED-mail), informal data sources such as news media, e-mail lists, blogs, and social media can complement formal public health surveillance by offering real-time clues to disease dynamics. Internet-based surveillance systems provided important early epidemic intelligence during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the 2009 H1N1 inf luenza pandemic, enhancing transparency by rapidly publicizing outbreak information. 3 Third, Internet-based data from social media can be used to assess disease-relevant healthrelated behaviors and sentiments relevant to disease control. During the H1N1 pandemic, sentiments about vaccination extracted from Twitter were shown to correlate well geographically with subsequent vaccination coverage throughout the United States. 5 Such analyses could provide important information to aid in planning and in the distribution of limited resources, as well as improving public health communications efforts.
 Fourth, these data provide researchers with an additional method for examining the period before an outbreak came to light. Despite international agreement that transparency is critical during an outbreak, accusations of delayed reporting are common and can be difficult to dispel. Time-series analysis of the volume of influenza-related searches on the Chinese Web search engine Baidu shows a low level of activity in the months leading up to the first announced H7N9 cases, which suggests that widespread unreported outbreaks were not festering before the announcement.
 Though digital epidemiology as an enabler of disease surveillance across political, cultural, and linguistic borders carries many advantages, it's not without its challenges. The dynamics of information spread are inherently different from the dynamics of disease spread. In the days immediately following the first reports of a few cases of a new disease, the volume of news reports and social media posts typically spikes dramatically (see figure, Panel A), because during that period most information is new and potentially relevant and therefore of high interest to the public. After some time, information saturation sets in, and public interest wanes, even as the number of new cases continues to rise. For newly emerging diseases with initially few cases, the social media data are typically dominated by news reports rather than first-person accounts of symptoms by sick individuals -a situation that differs markedly from that during recurring epidemics such as seasonal inf luenza. In the early phase of an outbreak, this effect makes it challenging for digital epidemiology to provide intelligence for early detection of cases of disease. Both human assessment and computational algorithmic intelligence are required to meet the challenge of extracting information from data sets that are both extremely large and noisy.
 In addition, information retrieval itself can be difficult. Consider Sina Weibo, which can be a particularly challenging platform for harvesting information. Posts are censored at a reportedly rapid rate, with 5% of deletions happening within 8 minutes, and 30% within 30 minutes. Because of concerns about censors, some Sina Weibo users rely on metaphors (see http://chinadigitaltimes.net/space/Introduction_to_the_Grass-Mud_Horse_Lexicon for an interesting glossary of terms used in the past), making it challenging for outsiders to follow what they're talking about. For example, in Chinese, the eponymous ""grass-mud horse"" sounds like an obscene phrase and indirectly references the Communist party. The phrase has evolved to mean an Internet-savvy person who dislikes and seeks to circumvent government censorship.
 Despite these challenges, the recent outbreaks of H7N9 influenza and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections illustrate the strengths of digital disease surveillance. In the case of H7N9, such surveillance has enhanced transparency and helped public health officials to understand the outbreak more fully. Although information was sparse in the MERS-CoV outbreak, digital disease surveillance proved its usefulness: the initial MERS-CoV case reports came to light through ProMED-mail (www.promedmail.org/d i rect.php?id=20120920.1302733). Since the SARS out break, the world has seen substantial progress in transparency and rapid reporting. The extent of these advancements varies, but overall, digital disease surveillance is providing the global health community with tools supporting faster response and deeper understanding of emerging public health threats.
 Health officials are aware of the catastrophic potential of pandemics. The potential for widespread infections with MERS-CoV outside of Saudi Arabia and the potential reemergence of H7N9 during next year's inf luenza season demand that digital disease surveillance be a part of the response.",52782e89c12dfb8cfbfafaa303b1f1021ea0ddfd,2013-08-01,"Salathé, Marcel; Freifeld, Clark C.; Mekaru, Sumiko R.; Tomasulo, Anna F.; Brownstein, John S.",New England Journal of Medicine,10.1056/nejmp1307752,New England Journal of Medicine,933.0,True,"BACKGROUND: Despite many notable successes in prevention and control, infectious diseases remain an enormous threat to human and animal health. Some pathogens are directly transmitted between individuals of a single species, whereas others circulate among multiple hosts, need arthropod vectors, or persist in environmental reservoirs. The practical challenges range from establishing appropriate data collection to managing increasingly large volumes of information. The possibility of future zoonoses tests our ability to detect anomalous outbreaks and to estimate human-to-human transmissibility against a backdrop of ongoing zoonotic spillover while also assessing the risk of more dangerous strains evolving. There is rapid growth in estimation of model parameters from mismatched or incomplete data, and in contrasting model output with realworld observations. OUTLOOK: Mathematical modeling has the potential to probe the apparently intractable complexity of infectious disease dynamics. In the face of this complexity, computational tools (Box 1) are essential for synthesizing information to understand epidemiological patterns and for developing and weighing the evidence base for decision-making. In the past 50 years, the study of infectious disease dynamics has grown into a rich interdisciplinary field. Nonlinearity also leads to counterintuitive phenomena (Fig. Given commonalities in processes across pathogens, progress made in one area can lead to advances in another. A few themes are chosen to illustrate current trends in model development and public health application. The 2014-2015 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa serves to highlight both opportunities and challenges in modeling for public health. With the opportunities of real-time modeling for public health come specific challenges. In an ongoing outbreak, data can be patchy and reporting delayed, and different data sources are not always synthesized. In any emerging epidemic, underreporting is a critical challenge for ongoing assessment of this epidemic and has had enormous impact on predictions of outbreak size, but also of outbreak impact-for example, in terms of the case-fatality ratio (the proportion of cases that lead to death). These limitations make it almost impossible to make reliable long-term predictions. Thus, modeling results are often based on scenarios in which a pathogen spreads unaltered by behavioral changes or the public health response. Careful communication of findings is key, and data and methods of analysis (including code) must be made freely available to the wider research community. It comprises statistical methods for inference directly from data, including methods to analyze sequencing and other genetic data. Such models take many forms, depending on the level of biological knowledge of processes involved and data available, and depending on the purpose. Certainly at lower levels of biological aggregation, chance dominatesfor example, in infection of individual cells or in contacts individual hosts make. There are purely stochastic models, purely deterministic models, and models that are mixed. Areas of rapid growth are statistical and numerical methods and tools to estimate model parameters from, often scarce, mismatched or incomplete data, and to contrast model output with real-world observations. The rising availability of pathogen genome sequence data, coupled with new computational methods, presents opportunities to identify with precision ""who infects whom"" and the networks of infection between humans and reservoirs (25) . However, current frameworks employ compartmental epidemiological models, which do not make efficient use of individuallevel epidemiological data. Although sampling theory is well developed for standard surveillance data, the relationship between a set of pathogen sequences and the phylogeny inferred from a population sample is more complex (11) . Analysis of bacterial genomes usually considers only those genes that are shared across taxa, but there are good reasons to believe that noncore (127) . ""Deep"" sequencing of pathogens within individual hosts generates information on withinhost diversity, resulting from evolution within the host (often in response to drug treatment), or multiple infections. To tackle within-host diversity, models that embed pathogen evolution within a transmission tree are needed. The spread of recombinant viruses implies the existence of multiple infections. This is a promising avenue for linking pathogen genetic data and human behavior. For seasonal influenza, models have played a key role in providing the scientific evidence base for vaccination policy, making use of the information in multiple, often unavoidably biased, data sources such as syndromic time series, vaccine coverage and efficacy, economic costs, and contact patterns in the population. Subsequent trial results showing that antiretroviral treatment (ART) of HIV-positive individuals could practically eliminate transmission within sexual partnerships when the index case is treated (100) have further supported the role of treatment as prevention. on April 21, 2016 http://science.sciencemag.org/ can interact to drive local (51) and large-scale dynamics (52) .

There is, typically in complex systems, a fundamental horizon beyond which accurate prediction is impossible. The field has yet to explore where that horizon is and whether computational tools and additional data (and if so which data) can stretch predictions to this limit. In contrast, ""what-if"" scenarios for public health intervention can provide qualitative (and increasingly semiquantitative) insight into their population consequences. Techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) have become firmly established tools for parameter estimation from data in infectious disease models [e.g., (63) ], and Monte Carlo based methods will play a pivotal role in addressing the challenges that lie in reconciling predictions and observations (64, 65) . Infectious diseases are an important frontier in public health, and their prevention and control call for global, rather than national or regional, coordinated efforts (75) (76) (77) (78) . The success of smallpox and rinderpest eradication campaigns shows the possibilities; the global spread of newly emerged pathogens (recently avian influenza strains and MERS coronavirus), the difficulties in curbing the spread of antibiotic resistance, the upsurge of polio toward the ""end-phase"" of its eradication, and the recent unprecedented spread of Ebola virus, are examples that show the need for international coordination and collaboration.

These signs included reduced appetite, elevated temperature, increased respiration rate, cough, piloerection, and hunched posture. Clinical signs were transient and lasted for a few days. Radiographic changes showed varying degrees of localized infiltration and interstitial markings (Fig. 1A) .
 After the animals were euthanized, postmortem examinations showed multifocal to coalescent bright red lesions throughout the lower respiratory tract indicative of acute pneumonia (Fig. 1B) . These lesions progressed into dark reddish purple areas of pulmonary inflammation, as seen on histopathological analysis (Fig. 1C) , with fibrous adhesions, consolidation, and edematous and atelectatic areas in the lungs.

In turn, the drop in vaccine coverage allows the number of individuals who are susceptible to infection to accumulate. Parents often vaccinate their children because other parents around them do so. Social differences between populations may be one reason for this. The challenges of studying disease-behavior systems are generating interesting science. Mathematical modelers are constructing realistic models tailored to specific systems and public health research questions, and testing the empirical validity of those models (4, 6, 12). Moreover, modelers are incorporating the insights of economists, sociologists and psychologists into disease-behavior models (4, 6, 10-13). Predicting ""the madness of men"" in disease-behavior systems may appear daunting. For example, some models predicted that cervical cancer vaccine uptake would be below recommended levels in the United States, which is what ended up occurring (12, 15) . We have much to learn from those who ""calculate the movement of stars""-astronomers routinely agree to standardize their nomenclature through committees. Vaccines and drugs for many long-established infectious diseases are becoming more widely available. Thus, population behavior may replace accessibility as the most challenging barrier to higher uptake of control measures. When a social contagion on a social network (A) and a biological contagion on an infection contact network (B) are coupled to one another (C), the resulting interplay can create complex dynamics that are not present in either network layer in isolation, such as the fall and rise of vaccine coverage during a vaccine scare (4) ."

Recent studies have shed light on the contribution of individual ISG effectors to the antiviral state, but most have examined those acting on early, intracellular stages of the viral life cycle. Here, we applied an image-based screen to identify ISGs inhibiting late stages of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We unraveled a directly antiviral function for the gene SERPINE1, encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). By targeting extracellular airway proteases, PAI-1 inhibits IAV glycoprotein cleavage, thereby reducing infectivity of progeny viruses. This was biologically relevant for IAV restriction in vivo. Further, partial PAI-1 deficiency, attributable to a polymorphism in human SERPINE1, conferred increased susceptibility to IAV in vitro. Together, our findings reveal that manipulating the extracellular environment to inhibit the last step in a virus life cycle is an important mechanism of the antiviral response. 632 Cell 160, 631-643, February 12, 2015 ª2015 Elsevier Inc.","Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) blocks surface glycoprotein maturation of influenza A virus, thus reducing virus spread in the airways and revealing that the innate immune system, driven by type I IFN, uses modulation of the extracellular environment to inhibit viruses.
 As obligate intracellular parasites, the fate of viruses is intricately linked to the metabolism of their host cells. Viruses exploit host cell mechanisms throughout their life cycle, from entry to replication, assembly and egress, and finally maturation. Each step in this cycle is a potential point for antiviral intervention.
 Virus-infected cells produce interferons (IFNs) that trigger transcriptional upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (reviewed in Schneider et al., 2014) . The combined action of hundreds of expressed ISG proteins creates multiple lines of de-fense against viral infection. It is not surprising that different ISGs block different pathways and have varying potency against different classes of viruses (Schoggins et al., 2014) . Our knowledge of ISG effector functions has been somewhat biased toward inhibition of early replication stages, such as entry, or viral translation initiation. However, viral assembly and release have proven to be an Achilles heel for viruses and are the targets of therapeutic small molecules (influenza A virus [IAV] neuraminidase inhibitors; HIV-1 protease inhibitors) and intrinsic ISGs such as tetherin (Neil et al., 2008) or viperin (Wang et al., 2007) .
 In this study, we established a screen that would also uncover host factors inhibiting late stages of the viral replication cycle, using IAV as a model virus. Applying an approach that accurately monitors several rounds of viral replication in the presence of single overexpressed ISGs, we discovered a direct antiviral function of the well-known gene SERPINE1, which encodes PAI-1 (Ny et al., 1986) . We demonstrate that PAI-1 inhibits IAV maturation by targeting host proteases needed for viral glycoprotein cleavage and that this is physiologically relevant in natural proteolytic landscapes both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we link a human genetic polymorphism in extracellular PAI-1 production to enhanced IAV susceptibility in vitro. In all, we show that shaping the extracellular environment can be a powerful mechanism in the vast arsenal of the innate immune response against invading pathogens.
 A Gain-of-Function Screen Reveals SERPINE1 Encoding PAI-1 as an Inhibitor of IAV Spread To identify ISG effectors targeting late stages of the IAV life cycle, we established a high-throughput, image-based screen using an extended version of a recently published ISG library comprising 401 cDNAs (Schoggins et al., 2011;  Table S1 ). Human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) were transduced with lentiviral vectors to express individual ISGs ( Figure 1A ). After 48 hr, cells were challenged with IAV WSN/33 (H1N1) at an MOI of 0.01. Red, transduced cells; green, infected cells; blue, DAPI-stained nuclei. (B) Effect of 401 single ISGs on IAV spread. ISGs inhibiting more than 2-fold SD in two independent screens are shown in red. Spread ratio, the ratio of infected cells at 24/8 hpi. A positive control for inhibition is a-HA antibody. (C) Confirmation assays for selected ISGs on A549 cells or primary NHBE cells. Data are represented as mean ± SEM from n = 6 values in two independent experiments for A549, and n = 3 for NHBE cells. ''Spread ratio'' was calculated from the number of infected cells at 24 hr post-infection (hpi) relative to 8 hpi for each ISG ( Figures  1A and S1A ). The screen was performed twice, using independently generated lentivirus libraries ( Figure 1B) . a-HA antibody, with a spread ratio of $2, was a positive control, whereas empty vector controls had a spread ratio of 50 to 60 ( Figures S1C and 1B) . Nineteen ISGs reduced the IAV spread ratio to <20, greater than two SDs from the empty vector control in both screens ( Figure 1B and Table S2 ). Among these ISGs were several broadly acting antiviral factors involved in pattern recognition and IFN signaling, such as DDX58 (RIG-I), IFIH1 (MDA5), IRF2, IRF7, IL28RA (IFNLR1), inflammatory cytokines, CCL5 (RANTES), and broadly acting or IAV-specific inhibitors, such as IFITM3, Mx1, and BST2 (Schneider et al., 2014) . IFITM3 and Mx1 act early (IAV entry or replication), whereas BST2, also known as tetherin, prevents release of budding virus particles at the host cell surface. Although conflicting data exist on IAV inhibition by tetherin (Mangeat et al., 2012; Watanabe et al., 2011; Yondola et al., 2011) , it potently inhibited spread in A549 cells and was subsequently used as a positive control. We also identified a number of ISGs with previously uncharacterized antiviral activities: MAP3K14, ELF1, PMM2, FAM46C, TBX3, SCO2, CRY1, TNFSF10 (TRAIL), XAF1, MAFF, and SERPINE1 (serine protease inhibitor, member E1). We validated this set of genes with independently generated, high-titer lentiviral stocks and A549 cells, as well as normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE). All but FAM46C, which did not inhibit virus spread on NHBE cells, were confirmed as antiviral ( Figure 1C ). To exclude false positives due to cytotoxicity, we tested cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA damage, and cell death profiles by high-throughput microscopy (HTM) (Figure S1D) . We found that only expression of MAP3K14, the most potent hit in our screen, and TNFSF10 were cytotoxic relative to the empty vector control.
 Because protease inhibitors have been used clinically to treat other viruses (e.g., HIV), an endogenous effector with a similar function was a promising lead. We therefore focused on exploring the antiviral action of SERPINE1, encoding PAI-1. SERPINE1 expression inhibited spread of various clinical IAV isolates, including a derivative of a highly pathogenic avian H5 influenza virus, modified to remove the polybasic cleavage site in the viral hemagglutinin (Steel et al., 2009) , A/Vietnam/1203/2004(HALo) (H5N1), the pandemic A/California/04/2009 (H1N1), and an isolate of swine origin, A/sw/Texas/4199-2/1998 (H3N2) ( Figure 1D ). In multi-step viral growth kinetics, SERPINE1 expression reduced extracellular IAV WSN/33 titers $10-fold, comparable to inhibition by tetherin ( Figure 1E ). This versatile SERPIN family member has been implicated in many physiological processes, including regulation of fibrinolysis (reviewed in Declerck and Gils, 2013) . However, since an antiviral effector function of PAI-1 protein in the context of the intrinsic immune response is novel, we set out to determine its role in restricting IAV infection.
 IAV Infection Enhances Secretion of PAI-1, which Is Both Necessary and Sufficient for IAV Inhibition We first studied the kinetics of SERPINE1 gene expression, as well as PAI-1 protein production and secretion. We compared A549 cells and the more relevant in vitro model of NHBE-derived, differentiated human ciliated airway epithelium cultures (HAEC), which mimic both the morphology and physiology of the airway epithelium in vivo. In A549 cells, SERPINE1 mRNA was slightly upregulated upon IFN-b stimulation and following infection with IAV WSN/33 ( Figure 2A ). This was not due to nonresponsiveness of A549 cells, since other ISGs were highly upregulated ( Figures S2A-S2C ). TGF-b is known to trigger SERPINE1 expression via the canonical Wnt/b-catenin pathway (He et al., 2010) . Indeed, TGF-b treatment of A549 cells strongly induced SERPINE1 expression with no or modest effects on ISG15, IFITM3, and BST2 mRNA levels ( Figures S2A-S2D ). Stimulation of SERPINE1 gene expression led to increased intracellular and extracellular levels of PAI-1 ( Figures 2B, 2C , S2E, and S2F). Consistent with PAI-1 being efficiently secreted, total PAI-1 levels in the supernatant were about 16-fold higher than in respective IFN-b-treated cell lysates at 24 hr (Figures 2B and 2C) . We observed apical secretion of PAI-1 by HAEC after either IAV WSN/33 infection ( Figure 2D ) or TGF-b treatment (Figure S2G) . Of note, even mock-treated A549 cells and HAEC constantly produced and secreted basal levels of PAI-1 that accumulated over time ( Figures 2B-2D ). However, PAI-1 is further upregulated by certain stimuli, including virus infection.
 To test possible IAV inhibition by extracellular PAI-1, we added recombinant active PAI-1 (rPAI-1) to the supernatant of A549 cells during IAV infection. rPAI-1 decreased IAV WSN/33 spread in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2E ). Conversely, we used a polyclonal a-PAI-1 antibody that targets the a-helix F of PAI-1 to neutralize PAI-1's ability to inhibit proteases (Komissarov et al., 2005) . Strikingly, we found that addition of a-PAI-1 antibody to A549 cells during infection significantly enhanced IAV spread compared to the IgG control ( Figure 2E ).
 Thus far, the extracellular environment in our experiments was defined by components of the growth medium or by proteins secreted by the cultured cells (endogenous or overexpressed). To test the potency of PAI-1 in a more natural setting, we examined IAV growth kinetics on HAEC in the presence or absence of rPAI-1. Strikingly, addition of rPAI to the apical side of HAEC significantly reduced IAV growth compared to carrier control, with $10-fold lower infectivity at 48 hpi ( Figure 2F ). In contrast, addition of a-PAI-1 antibody dramatically enhanced IAV growth as early as 12 hpi and continued throughout the course of infection. In both A549 cells and HAEC, human parainfluenzavirus 3 (HPIV3) was unaffected by either of these treatments, showing that the effect was selective for IAV and not due to cytotoxicity ( Figures S2H and S2I) .
 Experiments probing which stage of the viral life cycle was affected by PAI-1 showed no effects on early stages, replication, or egress ( Figures S3A-S3E ). However, a reduction of progeny particle infectivity ( Figure S3F ), together with the extracellular presence of PAI-1 ( Figure 2 ) and its well-described function as protease inhibitor (Declerck and Gils, 2013) , led us to investigate this activity as the mechanistic basis of PAI-1-mediated IAV inhibition.
 Infectivity of IAV progeny particles requires a maturation cleavage of the viral hemagglutinin (HA0 to HA1 and HA2), catalyzed by host proteases (Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975; Skehel and Waterfield, 1975) . We tested whether known HA-cleaving proteases might be direct targets for PAI-1 inhibition. PAI-1 inhibits protease function by forming a covalent, SDS-stable bond with the target protease, detectable in gel shift assays. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), a major target of PAI-1, formed a complex of $85 kDa with rPAI-1, but not in the presence of the PAI-1 inhibitor triplaxtinin ( Figure 3A ). TPCK-trypsin is another established target of PAI-1 and a prototype chymotrypsin-like serine protease (Olson et al., 2001) . To allow multiple rounds of IAV infection in cells lacking endogenous HA-cleaving proteases, such as A549, trypsin is typically added in low concentrations to the tissue culture medium. We readily detected PAI-1-trypsin complexes formed in vitro and their degradation products, which were again absent when triplaxtinin was added ( Figure 3B ). Furthermore, we identified human tryptase and human airway trypsin (HAT) as PAI-1 targets ( Figures 3C and 3D ). In contrast, we were unable to detect complexes of PAI-1 and furin, although this interaction has been previously reported (Figure S4) (Bernot et al., 2011) .
 The use of host proteases for maturation is not unique to IAV. Paramyxoviruses also use airway proteases to cleave their surface fusion (F) glycoprotein, and Sendai virus (SeV) utilizes the same extracellular airway proteases as IAV (Tashiro et al., 1992) . In contrast, HPIV3 F is cleaved intracellularly by ubiquitous endoproteases such as furin. Using the spread assay and trypsin as protease, we found that HPIV3 was not inhibited by PAI-1, whereas IAV WSN/33 and SeV both exhibited reduced spread ( Figures 3E-3G) . SERPINE1* encodes a catalytically inactive PAI-1 due to a single point mutation in the reactive center loop and served as a loss-of-function negative control (Lawrence et al., 1994) . These data clearly demonstrate that PAI-1 targets trypsin-like airway proteases needed for extracellular virus maturation.
 Next, we examined the efficiency of HA cleavage in the presence of PAI-1 and trypsin. We found that rPAI-1 completely blocked trypsin-mediated cleavage of HA0 into HA1 and HA2 ( Figure 4A ). Furthermore, expression of wild-type PAI-1, but not the inactive mutant, reduced the specific infectivity of IAV Puerto Rico/8/34 grown in the presence of trypsin ( Figure 4B ). We found similar results for the extracellular airway proteases transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and HAT, both known HA-cleaving proteases (Hatesuer et al., 2013; Figure 4C) . Treatment with additional trypsin prior to virus titration restored specific infectivity to the level of virus grown in the presence of either protease, suggesting that the defect in specific infectivity was indeed caused by uncleaved HA ( Figures  4B and 4C) .
 We next investigated cleavage efficiency of HA from different clades: H1 of A/Puerto Rico/8/34, H2 of A/Japan/ 305/57, and wild-type H5 of highly pathogenic A/Vietnam/ 1203/2004 ( Figures 4D and 4E ). Both H1 PR8 and H2 Japan were uncleaved at baseline but were readily cleaved by either exogenous trypsin or overexpressed TMPRSS2 ( Figure 4D) . mRNA expression was normalized relative to housekeeping gene RPS-11. Fold increase over pre-treatment control levels is shown. Accumulated total (B) intracellular and (C) extracellular protein levels of PAI-1 were determined by ELISA. Data are represented as mean ± SEM from n = 3 experiments.
 (D) HAEC infected with IAV WSN/33 or mock treated. Accumulated PAI-1 protein in repeated apical washes was determined by ELISA. Data are shown as mean ± SEM from n = 3 replicates.
 (E) A549 cells were infected with IAV WSN/33 in the presence of either rPAI-1 (1) or a-PAI-1 antibody (2), and virus spread was assayed by HTM at 48 hpi. The number of infected cells was normalized to buffer (1) or IgG (2). Data are represented as mean ± SEM from n = 4 independent experiments. Statistical significance relative to empty control was determined by t tests.
 (F) HAECs were infected with IAV WSN/33 in the presence of either rPAI (1) or a-PAI-1 (2) and buffer (1) or IgG (2). Progeny virus was collected from apical washes, and rPAI-1 or a-PAI-1 were replenished after each wash. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay. Data are shown as mean ± SEM from n = 3 replicates. See also Figure S2 .
 The slight differences in HA1 size between trypsin-and TMPRSS2-treated HA has been previously shown to be caused by altered glycosylation patterns in TMPRSS2-overexpressing cells (Bertram et al., 2010a) . Further, we found that wild-type but not mutant PAI-1 inhibited TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage of both HA subtypes. In contrast, cleavage of H5 Vietnam , which is mediated by endogenous intracellular proteases such as furin, was not impaired by PAI-1 ( Figure 4E ). This result is in line with data from PAI-1-furin gel shift assays ( Figure S4 ) and from experiments with furin-dependent HPIV3 ( Figures S2H and S2I ), further suggesting that furin is indeed not inhibited by PAI-1. Finally, we examined the cleavage state of HA on HAEC. These cultures produce and secrete intrinsic airway proteases on their apical side; in fact, they have previously enabled identification of several proteases that cleave HA (Bö ttcher et al., 2006) . Addition of rPAI-1 to HAEC during IAV WSN/33 infection dramatically reduced HA cleavage, whereas addition of a-PAI-1 increased cleavage ( Figure 4F ). These findings are in agreement with our previous results demonstrating virus growth kinetics in HAEC ( Figure 2F ). (A-D) Representative gel shift assays to show complexes of recombinant PAI-1 (rPAI-1) and indicated proteases. 1 mg of rPAI-1 was combined with increasing amounts of protease, and the mixture was separated on SDS gels followed by silver staining. Where indicated, triplaxtinin was used to inhibit PAI-1 activity.
 (E-G) HTM spread assay in the presence of PAI-1 wild-type (SERPINE1), loss-of-function mutant (SERPINE1*), and controls for HPIV3-GFP (E), IAV WSN/33 (F), or SeV-GFP (G). Data are shown as mean ± SEM from at least n = 6 replicates from 2 independent experiments. One-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis post-test. See also Figure S4 .
 Taken together, these data show that PAI-1 inhibits IAV spread by reducing extracellular cleavage maturation of progeny particles and that this mechanism operates in a physiologically relevant model of airway epithelium.
 To examine the role of PAI-1 during IAV infection in vivo, we infected Serpine1 À/ À or Serpine1 +/+ (B6) control mice intranasally with IAVs Puerto Rico/8/34, WSN/ 33, or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a control. Serpine1 was transcriptionally upregulated in B6 mouse lungs upon IAV infection ( Figure 5B ). We also detected increasing levels of murine PAI-1 (mPAI-1) in mouse lungs over the course of IAV infection with a 10-fold increase at 5 dpi compared to PBS-treated B6 ( Figure 5C ). Both Serpine1 mRNA and mPAI-1 protein were undetectable in Serpine1 À/À lung homogenates. IAV-infected Serpine1 À/À mice exhibited significant weight loss and succumbed to infection on average 1 day earlier than B6 parental mice ( Figures 5D, 5E , 5G, and 5H). This difference was not observed in mice infected with VSV control ( Figure S5A ). Despite the modest difference in survival, lung IAV titers at late times of infection were significantly elevated in Serpine1 À/À (Figures 5F and 5I), which correlated with the levels of mPAI-1. Keller et al. (2006) used Serpine1 À/À mice to study the effect of influenza virus infection on thrombosis, and they found no impact of PAI-1 on IAV infection, as measured by the amount of viral RNA at day 4 dpi. However, given the role of PAI-1 in blocking viral maturation, the levels of infectious virus particles (Figures 5F and 5I) are a more relevant measure. Serpine À/+ mice exhibited an intermediate phenotype with respect to weight loss, survival, and murine lung PAI-1 levels, indicating a co-dominant effect of PAI-1 on IAV infection ( Figure S5B ). Serpine1 À/À lungs were increased in size at 5 days post-IAV infection, with enhanced necrosis compared to lungs from B6 (B) BHK cells were transfected to express GFP as negative control, PAI-1 wild-type (SER1), or loss-of-function mutant (SER*) and then challenged with IAV Puerto Rico/8/1934 in the presence of TPCK-trypsin. Supernatants were harvested and assayed for infectivity by focus forming assay on MDCK cells and for viral RNA by qRT-PCR. Plaque assays were performed in duplicate with or without additional post-harvest incubation with TPCK-trypsin. Specific infectivity was determined by calculating the ratio of FFU to vRNA copies, and values were normalized to GFP control. Data are shown as mean ± SEM from n = 6 replicates from 2 independent experiments.
 (legend continued on next page) controls ( Figure 5A ). Bleeding into alveoli was slightly enhanced in infected Serpine1 À/À lungs at 4 dpi, which might be expected given PAI-1's role in fibrinolysis ( Figure S5C ). Cytokine expression was elevated in IAV-infected Serpine1 À/À lungs compared to B6 control lungs, indicating increased inflammation (Figure S5D ). In contrast, cytokine levels in uninfected lungs or in lungs from mice intranasally challenged with poly(I:C) were comparable between genotypes ( Figure S5E ). Thus, the increased weight loss and death observed in Serpine1 À/À mice during IAV infection cannot be simply attributed to a global upregulation of cytokines. Whereas cytokine levels began to decrease in IAVinfected B6 lungs at 5 dpi, suggesting a subsiding infection, they stagnated in Serpine1 À/À lungs, indicating an ongoing infection in Serpine1 À/À mice. This correlated with the presence of higher IAV titers in Serpine1 À/À mice at this late time point.
 To further confirm the in vivo phenotype, we generated murine tracheal epithelial cultures (MTEC) from the trachea of Serpine1 À/À or B6 wild-type mice, similar to HAEC. After challenge with A/X-31(H3N2), we found significantly increased vRNA and infectious virus in the Serpine1 À/À cultures at later times of infection ( Figure 5J ). These results strengthen the physiological relevance of Serpine1 as regulator of IAV spread and a component of the host barrier that restricts IAV infection in vivo.
 Natural PAI-1 Deficiency in Human Fibroblasts Is Correlated with Increased Spread of IAV Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), often linked to bleeding disorders, have been described for SERPINE1 (Fay et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2005) . SNP rs6092 is located in the signal peptide sequence of SERPINE1 (c.A43T), resulting in substitution of alanine by threonine (PAI-1 p.A15T) and partial intracellular retention of PAI-1. In fact, a heterozygous rs6092 carrier had 30% reduced serum PAI-1 and a tendency to hemorrhage (Zhang et al., 2005) . We characterized IAV susceptibility in three human fibroblast lines with at least one rs6092 allele. Two of these are heterozygous for SERPINE1 c.A43T (designated as T/A 4 and 5, Figure 6 ), and one is homozygous (A/A 6). We compared them to three control lines, all encoding wild-type PAI-1 (T/T 1-3).
 We found that IAV WSN/33 spread was significantly enhanced in the three c.A43T fibroblast lines compared to controls ( Figures  6A and 6B ). This was not due to enhanced replication, at least for T/A 5 and A/A 6 because the number of infected cells during one round of replication was similar to controls ( Figure 6C ). In multicycle growth experiments, we observed some variation between control lines, which is common, as donors are genetically heterogeneous. However, we found that each c.A43T fibroblast line produced significantly more infectious virus compared to each of the three controls ( Figure 6D ).
 To determine whether this phenotype was selective for IAV, we challenged the fibroblasts with HPIV3. Indeed, two of our three c.A43T fibroblast lines, T/A 5 and A/A 6, did not support increased spread or replication of HPIV3, as determined by HTM, or in multicycle growth assays ( Figures 6E-6G ). However T/A 4 exhibited both enhanced HPIV3 spread and replication compared to controls, in which we had previously observed enhanced IAV replication ( Figure 6C ), suggesting that this cell line may have other properties unrelated to SERPINE1 that promote virus replication and spread.
 Extracellular PAI-1 levels of c.A43T fibroblast cultures were about 50% that of controls, which was consistent with previous reports ( Figure 6H ; Zhang et al., 2005) . We next attempted to rescue IAV spread inhibition by adding rPAI-1 to the culture medium of A/A 1, T/A 5, and A/A 6 cells during IAV WSN/33 infection. rPAI-1 dramatically reduced virus spread in T/A 5 and A/A 6 cells down to the level of T/T 1 control cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, control STAT1 À/À fibroblasts, which support enhanced spread, but do not harbor c.A43T nor have reduced extracellular PAI-1 levels, could not be rescued to the level of T/T 1 controls ( Figure 6I ).
 These results show that a natural extracellular PAI-1 deficiency correlates with increased IAV spread.
 We identified the serine protease inhibitor PAI-1 as an ISG that restricted IAV spread, and we characterized its previously undescribed antiviral function. PAI-1 is a 50 kDa glycoprotein and the main physiological inhibitor of urokinase/tissue plasminogen activators (uPA/tPA), both major regulators of the fibrinolytic system. uPA/tPA convert the zymogen plasminogen into plasmin, triggering a proteolytic cascade to dissolve blood clots (reviewed in Declerck and Gils, 2013) . PAI-1 is present in plasma, platelets, and the extracellular matrix and is secreted by endothelial, smooth muscle, and immune cells in different tissues, including the airway. Other than uPA/tPA, PAI-1 inhibits multiple serine proteases of the chymotrypsin type, with varying efficiencies (Irving et al., 2000) .
 Here, we find three new PAI-1 protease targets: human tryptase (tryptase Clara; club cell secretory protein), HAT, and TMPRSS2, all of which are involved in extracellular IAV glycoprotein cleavage. This finding suggests a role for PAI-1 as an antiviral factor by targeting extracellular maturation of IAV particles.
 IAV maturation involves cleavage of its surface glycoprotein HA into HA1 and HA2. These proteins remain linked via a disulfide bond (Skehel and Waterfield, 1975) , which forms a hinge, a prerequisite for viral envelope fusion during entry (Klenk et al., 1975; Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975) . Because IAV does not encode its own protease, HA cleavage depends on the (C) BHK cells were transfected to co-express GFP as negative control, PAI-1 wild-type (SER), or loss-of-function mutant (SER*), and TMPRSS2 or HAT as bait protease. Cells were then challenged, and virus infectivity was analyzed as described in (B) .

 (legend continued on next page) presence of host proteases at the site of IAV replication. Furin and PC5/6, members of the subtilisin-like family of serine-proteases, are known to cleave HA intracellularly (Horimoto et al., 1994; Stieneke-Grö ber et al., 1992) . We could not find evidence for inhibition of furin by PAI-1. Human tryptase, HAT, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS13, mosaic serine protease large-form (MSPL), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), and plasmin are known extracellular HA-cleaving proteases (Lazarowitz et al., 1973; reviewed in Bertram et al., 2010b) . Most are members of the chymotrypsin-like serine protease family, the ''target family'' of PAI-1. Here, we provide direct proof that PAI-1 efficiently inhibits trypsin-and TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage of HA, and we hypothesize that PAI-1 might inhibit other members of this protease family as well.
 Accessibility to glycoprotein cleavage is a major determinant of IAV pathogenicity (Bosch et al., 1981) . Whether, and at what efficiency, an HA subtype can be cleaved by a given protease is determined by its cleavage site sequence. Highly pathogenic avian H5 and H7 HAs contain a multi-basic cleavage site, which makes them accessible to ubiquitiously expressed, intracellular proteases like furin (Bosch et al., 1981) . Hence, viral particles of these subtypes are immediately mature and infectious upon budding. Less pathogenic IAV HAs, in contrast, contain a single arginine residue in their cleavage site, which makes them dependent on cleavage by extracellular airway proteases, such as TMPRSS2. Variation in the amino acid sequence surrounding this arginine alters cleavage efficiency (Galloway et al., 2013) . Recent studies in TMPRSS2 À/À mice revealed a direct influence on pathogenicity of IAV strains relying on this protease (Hatesuer et al., 2013; Sakai et al., 2014; Tarnow et al., 2014) . In the absence of TMPRSS2, IAV of H1N1, H3N2, or H7N9 origin were unable to spread from the trachea to the lungs, making the mice highly resistant. This was not the case for highly pathogenic H5N1 virus (Sakai et al., 2014) . Thus, sensitivity to PAI-1mediated inhibition (or inhibition by other protease inhibitors) will depend on the nature of the cleaving protease, as well as on the cleavage efficiency of a specific HA subtype by that protease ( Figure 5 ). In this regard, it will be interesting to determine whether the protease inhibitor PAI-1 has differential impact on pathogenicity of different IAV subtypes in vivo.
 Not surprisingly, HA cleavage has been proposed as a target for antiviral therapy. Synthetic inhibitors, such as morpholinos or peptide mimetic protease inhibitors, have been used to target single proteases (Bö ttcher-Friebertshä user et al., 2011). Leupeptin of actinomyces origin, the synthetic drug camostat, or aprotinin from bovine lungs all have broader antiprotease activity (Beppu et al., 1997; Lee et al., 1996; Tashiro et al., 1987; Zhirnov et al., 2011) . So does recombinant mucus protease inhibitor (MPI), the only previously known airway protease inhibitor of human origin with anti-IAV activity (Beppu et al., 1997) . The efficacy of applying these molecules to restrict IAV has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo and validates HA cleavage inhibition as an attractive antiviral strategy. Our data show that PAI-1 employs this mechanism and is the first known host protease inhibitor that functions to protect the host during natural IAV infection.
 PAI-1 is a somewhat unconventional ISG, as it is constitutively expressed, but can be further upregulated by IFN and other cytokines like IL-6, IL-1, TGF-b, and TNF-a (Medcalf, 2007) . This is significant because HA-cleaving proteases are often upregulated by IAV infection, skewing the protease-protease inhibitor balance in favor of the virus (Kido et al., 2012) . Thus, PAI-1 may tip the balance back toward the host. Its regulation by TGF-b might be particularly relevant during IAV infections because IAV neuraminidase can activate latent TGF-b (Carlson et al., 2010) . Other sources of TGF-b in the airway during infection include secretion by macrophages and by epithelial cells.
 It is interesting that upregulation of SERPINE1 gene expression during infection is not as dramatic as for other ISGs, possibly reflecting PAI-1's critical role in other local and systemic physiological processes, where massive overproduction could be deleterious for blood clotting, cancer metastasis, or cell adhesion and migration (reviewed in Declerck and Gils, 2013) . PAI-1 is the only SERPIN that spontaneously-and quickly-adopts a latent form in vivo, which provides a regulatory mechanism, both spatially and temporally (Berkenpas et al., 1995) .
 The respiratory tract is a major portal for virus entry into the body but is protected by a multilayered antiviral fence. Mucus acts as a physical extracellular barrier. Mucins and surfactant proteins in mucus trap and aggregate virus particles outside of cells or act as decoy receptors inhibiting early steps in the viral replication cycle (Hartshorn et al., 2006; Reading et al., 2008) . Mucins are present in airways at constitutive levels but are upregulated during inflammation (Turner and Jones, 2009). We now add PAI-1 as an additional component of this extracellular barrier. PAI-1 is the first extracellular directly antiviral ISG, and its promiscuity suggests that it may also play an important role in host defense against other respiratory viruses that rely on this step in their life cycles.
 Many virus families require a maturation cleavage of viral surface glycoproteins, generally realized by serine proteases. Some use virus-encoded proteases, such as picornaviruses or retroviruses (Brody et al., 1992; Lee et al., 1993) . Others, such as paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses, or arenaviruses, rely on host proteases (Glowacka et al., 2011; Lenz et al., 2001; Skehel and Waterfield, 1975; Steinhauer and Plemper, 2012; Volchkov et al., 1998) . All are potentially sensitive to inhibition of their activating proteases by host or pharmacological protease inhibitors. Indeed, we show that a single inhibitor, PAI-1, significantly inhibits spread of IAV and SeV. Further exploration of the virus-activating protease-host inhibitor troika may open new avenues for antiviral intervention and deepen our understanding of virus maturation and pathogenicity.
 (J) MTECs cultured from B6 or Serpine1 À/À mice were infected with A/X-31(H3N2) at MOI = 10 À6 . vRNA was quantified from lysed MTEC by qRT-PCR. In parallel, infectious virus titers were determined by TCID 50 assay on MDCK cells. Data are shown as mean ± SEM from n = 3 B6 or Serpine1 À/À MTECs. Statistical significance was determined by two-way ANOVA. See also Figure S5 . In conclusion, we identify SERPINE1/PAI-1 as a host factor inhibiting IAV spread and show that PAI-1 mechanistically acts by blocking maturation of progeny IAV particles, thus reducing particle infectivity. Naturally occurring human genetic variations in PAI-1 impact the ability of IAV to spread from cell to cell, thus identifying PAI-1 as a candidate human gene that may influence susceptibility to IAV and the outcome of infection. In this regard, it will be of immediate interest to determine whether PAI-1 deficiency might be linked with the severity of human IAV infection. Finally, our work suggests that localized administration of PAI-1 to the respiratory tract might provide a new therapeutic approach for treating IAV and other respiratory viruses that require extracellular protease-driven maturation.
 High-Throughput Microscopy Screening of Host Factor Library Using Gateway technology, we transferred a previously published library of ISGs (Schoggins et al., 2011) from ORFEXPRESS entry clones into a new lentiviral expression vector (pSCRPSY), co-expressing TagRFP as a transduction control and puromycin resistance. A549 cells in 96-well plates were first transduced and then challenged with IAV WSN/33 at MOI 0.01. Due to varying transduction efficiency between the lentiviral stocks, the percentage of nontransduced cells was variable. IAV production from non-transduced cells masked potential inhibitory effects of ISGs and was eliminated by adding puromycin 1 hr prior to IAV infection. Lentiviral transduction was performed in duplicate plates for each ISG, where one sample was fixed after one round of replication (8 hpi), defining the number of initial producer cells, and the other after several rounds of replication (24 hpi). ''Spread ratio'' was calculated by dividing the IAV-infected cells at 24 hpi by 8 hpi for each individual ISG over empty vector-transduced cells (Figures 1A, S1A , and S1B) and yielded results that were stable over a wide range of transduction efficiencies ( Figure S1B ). Infected cells were detected by staining for IAV nucleoprotein (NP) and HTM ( Figures 1A, S1A , and S1B).
 Mice were housed in an AAALAC-accredited facility in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All procedures outlined in the study were approved by The Rockefeller University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Wild-type (C57BL/6J) and Serpine À/À (B6.129S2-Serpine 1tm1Mlg/J ) breeder pairs were purchased from Jackson Laboratory, and colonies were established in-house. Six-to ten-week-old mice of both sexes were used in IAV challenge, and 10-to 14-week-old mice were used for VSV experiments.
 Informed consent was obtained from human subjects according to local regulations. Samples were subsequently transferred for experimental testing under respective ethics approvals at INSERM in France and at Rockefeller University in the USA. All protocols involving the use of human tissue were reviewed and exempted by The Rockefeller University Institutional Review Board. Tashiro, M., Klenk, H.D., and Rott, R. (1987) .

 Egg-grown influenza viruses A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8), A/Vietnam/1203/2004(HALo) (H5N1), pandemic A/California/04/ 2009 (H1N1), and A/sw/Texas/4199-2/1998 (H3N2) were obtained from Peter Palese, and A/Puerto Rico/8/1934-NS1-GFP reporter virus was from Adolfo Garcia-Sastre. Human parainfluenza virus 3 -GFP (HPIV3-GFP) was a gift from Peter Collins, NIAID, NIH. We received Sendai virus-GFP from Dominique Garcin, University of Geneva. IAV WSN/33 (H1N1) and X-31(H3N2) were grown on MDCK cells. Vesicular stomatitis virus strain Indiana was grown and titrated on BHK cells. Adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549), rhesus macaque kidney (LLC-MK2) and 293T cells were purchased from ATCC, and normal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells (NHBE) were from Lonza.
 Human airway tracheobronchial epithelial cells isolated from airway specimens from patients with normal lungs were provided by Lonza, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Primary cells derived from single patient sources were expanded on plastic to generate passage 1 cells, which were subsequently plated (5x10 4 cells/well) on rat-tail collagen type 1-coated permeable transwell membrane supports (6.5 mm; Corning Inc). HAE cultures were grown in B-ALI medium supplemented with inducer (Lonza, Inc.) at each media change with provision of an air-liquid interface for approximately 6 weeks to form differentiated, polarized cultures that resemble in vivo pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium.
 For infection, HAE were rinsed with PBS to transiently remove apical secretions and supplied with fresh basolateral medium prior to inoculation. We used 5x10 4 PFU A/WSN/33 or 1.4x10 4 TCID 50 HPIV3-GFP, respectively, per culture. Virus was diluted in PBS and supplemented with either 5 ng rPAI-1, buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.6), 400 ng a-PAI-1 (abcam), or 400 ng rabbit IgG control per culture. The inoculum was applied to the apical surface of HAE for 2 hr at 37 C. Following incubation, viral inocula were removed, and cultures were washed 3 times with PBS. rPAI-1, buffer, a-PAI or IgG were replenished in 20 ml volume per culture, and cultures were incubated at 37 C for the duration of the experiment. Progeny virus was harvested at indicated times by performing apical washes with 100ml of PBS for 30 min at 37 C. After each wash, rPAI, buffer, a-PAI-1 or IgG were replenished. Washes were harvested and stored at À80 C prior to analysis. Viral titers in the apical washes were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells (A/WSN/33), or TCID 50 assay on LLC-MK2 cells (HPIV3-GFP).
 Primary human dermal fibroblasts were obtained from punch biopsies from human subjects from a cohort with various infectious disease. The cells were electroporated with a plasmid encoding the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen to create SV40-immortalized fibroblasts (SV40-fibroblasts), and were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with gentamycin and 10% FBS until primary cells were no longer present.
 To screen ISGs for antiviral activity, we obtained sequence-validated ORFEXPRESS ISG shuttle clones (GeneCopoeia) and used Gateway technology to move genes into pSCRPSY lentiviral vector co-expressing RFP and a puromycin resistance gene. SERPINE1 was cloned into pCRâ8/GW/TOPOâ TA (Life Technologies). This entry clone DNA was used as template to insert mutation T356R using Quikchange technology (Agilent). SERPINE1 T356R (referred to as SERPINE1*) was previously described to convey loss of function (Lawrence et al., 1994) . Both SERPINE1 wild-type and SERPINE1* were moved into either pSCRPSY, for lentivirus production, or pDEST40 (Life Technologies), for transfection experiments. HA1 PR8 , H2 Japan and H5 Vietnam in pCAGGS-LIC were obtained from David Steinhauer (Emory University, Atlanta). Plasmids encoding TMPRSS2 and HAT were obtained from Gary Whittaker (Cornell University, Ithaca).
 For high-throughput microscopy, we used a-nucleoprotein (NP) mAb (Millipore), AnnexinV-AlexaFluor-647 conjugate (Life Technologies), anti-phosphorylated H2AX (Pierce), SYTOX green dead cell stain (Life Technologies), and AlexaFluor-488 or À647 secondary antibodies. To block spread of IAV in tissue culture, we used a-HA mAb 2G9 at 0.125 mg/ml (kind gift of Adolfo Garcia-Sastre). To neutralize PAI-1 in cell supernatants, we used rabbit polyclonal anti-PAI-1 (Abcam) at 50 or 10 mg/ml dilution, and rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) as control. For visualization of HA in western blots, the following reagents were obtained through the NIH Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository, NIAID, NIH: Polyclonal anti-influenza virus H1 (H0) hemagglutinin (HA), A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1), antiserum, goat, NR-3148; polyclonal anti-influenza virus H2 hemagglutinin (HA), A/Singapore/1/ 1957 (H2N2), antiserum, goat, NR-4523; and polyclonal anti-influenza virus H5 hemagglutinin (HA), A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1), antiserum, goat, NR-2705.
 We used recombinant active human PAI-1 (carrying stabilizing mutations N150K, K154T, Q319L and M354I, Abcam) in tissue culture at 25 or 12 ng/ml final concentration and in in vitro assays at 1 mg/reaction. TPCK trypsin, human tryptase (both Sigma), recombinant HAT (R&D Systems), recombinant active furin (Abcam and NEB), and recombinant active urokinase plasminogen activator (both Abcam) were used in a 1:2 serial dilutions starting at 1mg/reaction.
 We used a stable form of rPAI-1, which carries four amino acid changes, prolonging its half-life from 2 to > 140 hr (Berkenpas et al., 1995) . Target rPAI-1 levels in this experiment were chosen to reflect physiological concentrations, at 25 or 12.5 ng/ml, respectively.
 High-Throughput Microscopy Screening of Host Factor Library A549 cells in 96-well plates were transduced with the lentiviral ISG stocks for 2d, on duplicate plates, and then infected with IAV WSN/ 33 at 100 PFU/well (MOI 0.01). Puromycin selection of 10 mg/ml was applied from 60 min prior to IAV challenge until the end of the experiment to suppress virus production from untransduced cells. To detect single round infection, cells were fixed with 1.5% paraformaldehyde at 8-12 hpi, and to monitor viral spread, duplicate wells were fixed at 24 hpi. Cells were then permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1% in PBS), and stained for NP-positive cells and DAPI. Fish gelatin (0.2% in PBS) was used as blocking reagent, and all washing steps during immunostaining were performed using BioTek EL406 Plate Washer and Dispenser. 48 overlapping images per well were taken using the ImageXPressMICRO System (Molecular Devices), and images were stitched and analyzed for total (DAPI), transduced (RFP) and infected cells (Alexa488) with MetaXPress software V5.1.0.46. 24hpi values were normalized to their respective early values to account for differences in transduction efficiency and to determine the number of cells that were infected at late stages from one initially infected cell (''founder cell''). For all ISG hit validation experiments, we generated lentiviral stocks that were independent from the primary screening preparations. When indicated in the respective figures, we modified the HTM protocol regarding cell type, virus and timing of time points.
 To determine SERPINE1 mRNA expression and protein secretion kinetics, we treated A549 cells or HAE cultures with the following conditions: IFN-b (Abcam) at 1pmol/ml, TGF-b (Abcam) at 1 pg/ml, IAV WSN/33 infection at MOI 1 (A549) or 0.1 (HAE). mRNA levels, normalized to housekeeping gene RPS-11, were determined by qRT-PCR (SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System, Life Technologies) and SYBR green assay (Roche) as described previously. Primer sequences can be found in Table S3 . Total PAI-1 protein levels from cell supernatants or cell lysates (1% Triton X-100 in PBS, sonication for 10 min) were measured by Human PAI-1 Platinum ELISA (BD Biosciences). mPAI-1 levels from mouse lung homogenates were measured by PAI-1 total mouse ELISA kit (Abcam).
 All inhibitors used in tissue culture were titrated for toxicity (by Sytox stain, AnnexinV stain, PrestoBlue assay) and subsequently used at the highest possible, non-cytotoxic dose. Diphyllin (ChemDiv) was used to block IAV entry at 10 mM, and Ribavirin at 500 mM as replication inhibition control, respectively. Triplaxtinin (PAI-039, Axonmedchem) was used as PAI-1 inhibitor for in vitro assays at 10 mM. JAK inhibitor 1 (Calbiochem) was used at 500 ng/ml in SeV-GFP spread assays.
 Unless stated otherwise, the following media was used during virus infections on A549 cells: DMEM, 0.3% BSA (Equitech), 0.1% FBS, Pen/Strep, 1 mg/ml TPCK-trypsin. For infection of human fibroblasts, we used DMEM, 0.3% protease-free BSA (Sigma), 0.1% FBS, Pen/Strep, and 1mg/ml TPCK-trypsin. For infection in serum-free conditions on BHK cells, MEM with Pen/Strep was used, with or without addition of 1 mg/ml TPCK, as indicated. We used serum-free overlay for plaque assay on MDCK cells: DMEM, 0.00001% DEAE, 0.0001% NaHCO 3 , GlutaMax, NEAA, 0.5mg/ml TPCK, 1.2% avicel (or 1% oxoid agar).
 We transduced A549 with the indicated lentiviruses, and performed all assays 2d after. For the mini genome assay, transduced cells were transfected, in a 24-well format, with pCAGGS constructs for IAV WSN/33 PB1, PB2, PA (100 ng each), and NP or empty pCAGGS (200ng), as well as the RNA polymerase II-driven Renilla luciferase reporter pRLTK (40 ng), and the IAV-specific RNA polymerase I-driven firefly luciferase reporter (pPolI-luc, 60 ng). Diphyllin or Ribavirin were added as controls 4h before transfection and until the end of the experiment. Cells were harvested 20h post-transfection, lysed and assayed using Dual Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega).
 For determination of egress efficiency, transduced A549 were challenged with IAV WSN/33 at MOI 0.1. At 24 hpi, cells were harvested for quantitation of intracellular vRNA and supernatants for determination of extracellular vRNA and number of infectious particles. Viral RNA was extracted with RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, for cells) or QIAmp Viral RNA kit (QIAGEN, for supernatants). For genome quantification by Taqman RT-PCR we used RealTime ready RNA Virus Master (Roche); primer and probe sequences can be found in Table S3 . The number of infectious particles in the supernatants were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells using avicel overlay and crystal violet staining (A/WSN/33), or agar overlay followed by NP-immunostaining (A/PR/8/1934).
 For HA cleavage assays with trypsin and rPAI, BHK cells were transfected in 6-well plates in serum-free MEM, with either 4 mg pCAGGS encoding HA PR8 . At 48h post-transfection, MEM was replaced by fresh MEM, MEM containing 5 mg/ml TPCK, or MEM containing a mix of 5 mg/ml TPCK and 20 mg/ml rPAI (previously incubated for 1h at 37 C). Cells were incubated for 60 min. Then, floating cells in media were collected by centrifugation, and remaining adherent cells were harvested with 1 ml/well of enzyme-free PBSbased dissociation reagent and scraping. For cleavage assays in the presence of TMPRSS2, BHK cells were transfected with 3 mg of respective HA plasmid, and 3 mg of SERPINE1/SERPINE1* plasmid plus 1 mg TMPRSS2 plasmid. At 48h post-transfection, 5 mg/ml trypsin were added to the control well for 30 min. Cells were then harvested by scraping, collected by centrifugation, and lysed in 1x NuPage loading buffer and reducing agent. HA cleavage was analyzed by western blot using antibody specific for the respective HA.
 For specific infectivity assays, BHK cells were co-transfected, in MEM, with previously published protease-encoding plasmids (HAT or TMPRSS2) and pcDNA-DEST40 plasmids encoding PAI-1 wild-type or mutant T356R. At 36h post-transfection, media was collected, cells were washed twice with PBS and infected in serum-free MEM with A/PR/8/1934 at MOI 0.5. After 1h of incubation, cells were washed again, and overlaid with the same media from before (containing PAI-1 and proteases). Supernatants were collected for plaque assay and vRNA at 24hpi. vRNA was determined by qRT-PCR, and FFU by focus forming assay. To rescue specific infectivity, a duplicate of supernatants was incubated with additional 2 mg/ml TPCK-trypsin in the dilution medium for 30 min prior to focus forming assay.
 Wild-type (C57BL/6J; referred to as B6) and Serpine À/À mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/10 mg/kg), and 36 LD 50 IAV PR/8/1934 or WSN/33 virus, diluted in a volume of 35 ml, was administered intranasally. Dose-response experiments with PR8 and WSN in WT and KO mice had showed that 36 LD 50 (corresponding 1000 PFU of PR8) was optimal to reveal the difference between WT and KO mice regarding weight loss, survival and viral titers. For VSV strain Indiana, 10 5 PFU per mouse were administered intranasally.
 Clinical signs were assessed by visual inspection, as well as daily weighing of the animals. Animals that became moribund and lost > 25% of their body weight as compared to day 0 were immediately euthanized.
 For the poly(I:C) challenge experiment, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/10 mg/kg), and 100 mg of poly(I:C) (InVivogen), diluted with PBS in a volume of 35 ml, was administered intranasally.
 For determination of virus lung titers and ISG mRNA profiles, animals were sacrificed at indicated time points, whole lungs were collected, homogenized in 500 ml PBS, and debris was spun down at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were analyzed by plaque assay and qRT-PCR. Primer sequences for mouse ISG SYBR green assays can be found in the Table S3 .
 For pathology, following euthanasia by CO 2 inhalation, the chest was opened and 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) was injected in the trachea with a syringe and a 25 g needle until the lungs were expanded to their normal in situ size. The lungs were then immersed in 10% NBF, and 72h later were processed in ethanol and xylene, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 m thickness, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. One longitudinal section was obtained from each pair of lungs, and included the whole lungs and major airways. Slides were examined by a board-certified veterinary pathologist and bleeding was scored semiquantitatively: (0: absent, 1: minimal, 2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: marked).
 Isolation and culture of primary mouse tracheal epithelial cell cultures (MTECs) were performed as previously described. Briefly, tracheas were washed with media, opened longitudinally, and then incubated in Ham's F-12 containing 3 mg/ml pronase for 18 hr at 4 C.
 Cells isolated by enzymatic treatment were then seeded onto 0.4 mm pore size clear polyester membrane (Corning) coated with a collagen solution. At confluence, media was removed from the upper chamber to establish an air-liquid interface (ALI). Fully differentiated, 14-20 day-old post-ALI cultures were used for experiments.
 For infection, the apical surface of MTEC cultures was washed extensively to remove accumulated mucins before inoculation with influenza A/X-31(H3N2) virus (MOI 10 À6 ). After incubation at 37 C for 1 hr, the virus inoculum was removed and the cultures were incubated in complete growth medium. Aliquots of the supernatants were collected at different time points for virus titration.
 RNA was isolated from MTEC cultures by directly lysing the cells in the transwells, using the QIAGEN RNeasy mini kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the ThermoScript RT-PCR System kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA served as template for the amplification of genes of interest and the housekeeping gene (Hprt1) by real-time PCR, using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems), universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI-PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The fold increase in mRNA expression was determined using the DDC t method relative to the values in mock treated samples, after normalization to Hprt1 gene expression. Virus was quantified by qPCR for the Matrix gene; primer sequences can be found in Table S3 . Alternatively, virus was titrated on MDCK cells by the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ), by eight replicates of 10-fold serial dilutions, according to the Spearman-Karber method. Figure S1 . High-Throughput Microscopy Screens for Inhibitors of IAV Spread, Related to Figure 1 (A) Example of automated cell scoring from the HTM screen. Images show one representative out of 48 views per 96-well; original images from individual channels on the left (blue, DAPI-stained nuclei; red, transduced cells; green, NP-positive cells), and segmented images on the right (gray, nuclei; red, transduced cells; green, NP-positive cells). (B) Establishing the spread ratio as a stable measure of spread over a large range of transduction efficiencies. A549 cells were transduced with a dilution series of BST2-expressing lentivirus, or a high dose of empty vector, the latter yielding 90% of transduced cells. A/WSN/33 spread was determined as described in Figure 1A . (C) Establishing a-HA antibody to block IAV spread. A549 cells were infected with IAV WSN/33 for 24h, in the presence or absence of an a-HA antibody serial dilution, then fixed and stained for IAV NP. Shown are results from automated quantification, and representative images of two wells with the minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.125 mg/ml, or without a-HA are shown. (D) Cytotoxicity assays of selected hits from the screen. A549 cells in 96-well plates were transduced with high-titer lentiviral stocks, yielding 90% transduced cells. Cells were then assayed by HTM for (from top to bottom): cell survival/proliferation, by DAPI stain and cell count; apoptosis, by Annexin V stain; DNA damage, by staining for phosphorylated H2AX; and cell membrane integrity, by Sytox stain. Tamoxifen and staurosporine were used as positive controls, untreated and untransduced cells as negative controls. Representative images from the respective assays are shown on the right.

A549 cells were infected with HPIV3-GFP for 48 hpi in the presence of either rPAI-1 (1) or a-PAI-1 antibody (2), and virus spread was assayed by HTM. The number of infected cells was normalized to buffer (1) or IgG control (2). Data are represented as mean ± SEM from n = 4 independent experiments. Statistical significance relative to empty control was determined by t tests. (I). HAEC were infected with HPIV3-GFP in the presence of either recombinant stable human PAI-1 (rPAI-1, 1) or a-PAI-1 antibody (2), and buffer (1) or IgG (2) as controls. Progeny virus was collected from apical washes at the indicated times and rPAI-1 or a-PAI-1 were replenished after each wash. Virus titers were determined by TCID 50 assay. Data are represented as mean ± SEM from n = 3 replicates. (A-D) Representative gel shift assays to test the formation of SDS-stable complexes of recombinant PAI-1 (rPAI-1) and furin. (A+B). 1mg of rPAI-1 was combined with increasing amounts of active recombinant furin (from abcam, A, and from NEB, B), and the mixture was separated on SDS gels followed by silver staining. Where indicated, Triplaxtinin was used at 3.3 mM to inhibit PAI-1. (C) . To establish conditions for furin-rPAI-binding, 1mg rPAI was combined with 0.1 U furin (abcam) in 100 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 1 mM CaCl 2 , with the addition 0.5% Triton X-100 at either 24 or 37 C for indicated times.
 (D) 1mg rPAI was combined with 0.1 U furin (abcam) in 100 mM HEPES [pH 9], 1 mM CaCl 2 , with the addition 0.5% Triton X-100 at either 24 or 37 C for indicated times. Figure S5 . Role of Serpine1 on Virus Infection in Mice, Related to Figure 6 (A) Wild-type (B6) or Serpine1 À/À mice were infected intranasally with 1x10 5 PFU of vesicular stomatitis virus, and monitored for weight loss and survival. Data are represented as mean ± SEM from n = 10 infected B6 or Serpine1 À/À mice, and n = 3 respective PBS control animals. Statistical significance was determined by individual t test or log rank test. No significant differences could be detected. (B) Wild-type (B6), Serpine +/À or Serpine1 À/À littermate mice were infected intranasally with 1000 PFU (36 LD 50 ) of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus, and assayed for weight loss and survival. Homogenates of infected mouse lungs were assayed for mPAI-1 protein levels by ELISA. (C) Pathology of lung cross-sections from mouse lungs at 4 dpi, stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

Although these efforts are critical for understanding the evolving public health situation, since there are limited resources available, intelligence for assessing the threat must come from a wide range of data sources. Though relatively new, digital disease surveillance is an increasingly powerful tool that complements traditional approaches. 3 In this and other outbreaks, digital disease surveillance has supplemented the critical laboratory studies and work in the trenches by public health officials and epidemiologists, by leveraging widespread use of the Internet, mobile phones, and social media. 4 Second, these data can be used to continuously monitor disease levels. Time-series analysis of the volume of influenza-related searches on the Chinese Web search engine Baidu shows a low level of activity in the months leading up to the first announced H7N9 cases, which suggests that widespread unreported outbreaks were not festering before the announcement. Though digital epidemiology as an enabler of disease surveillance across political, cultural, and linguistic borders carries many advantages, it's not without its challenges. The dynamics of information spread are inherently different from the dynamics of disease spread. In the early phase of an outbreak, this effect makes it challenging for digital epidemiology to provide intelligence for early detection of cases of disease. In addition, information retrieval itself can be difficult. Consider Sina Weibo, which can be a particularly challenging platform for harvesting information."
9,9,eba30aa66abb1e20a5e265b63f94c6734c909c93,,Insulin Degrading Enzyme Is a Cellular Receptor Mediating Varicella-Zoster Virus Infection and Cell-to-Cell Spread,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles. While varicella is likely spread as cell-free virus to susceptible hosts, the virus is transmitted by cell-to-cell spread in the body and in vitro. Since VZV glycoprotein E (gE) is essential for virus infection, we postulated that gE binds to a cellular receptor. We found that insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) interacts with gE through its extracellular domain. Downregulation of IDE by siRNA, or blocking of IDE with antibody, with soluble IDE protein extracted from liver, or with bacitracin inhibited VZV infection. Cell-to-cell spread of virus was also impaired by blocking IDE. Transfection of cell lines impaired for VZV infection with a plasmid expressing human IDE resulted in increased entry and enhanced infection with cell-free and cell-associated virus. These studies indicate that IDE is a cellular receptor for both cell-free and cellassociated VZV.","Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the etiologic agent of varicella (chickenpox) and zoster (shingles). VZV is a member of the a-herpesvirus family and is closely related to the other two human virus members of the family, herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2. Acute infection with VZV is followed by cell-associated viremia and the rash of varicella (Arvin, 2001) . The virus establishes latency in the nervous system and can reactivate to cause zoster. While varicella is likely transmitted by cell-free airborne virions, in cell culture VZV is highly cell associated, and the virus is propagated by cell-to-cell spread with no infectious virus present in the medium. The virus is thought to spread within the body by cell-to-cell transfer of virus.
 The mechanism of VZV entry into target cells and spread from cell-to-cell is not well understood. Previous studies showed that VZV, like other members of the herpesvirus family, engages cell surface heparan sulfate for initial attachment (Zhu et al., 1995) . Mannose 6-phosphate inhibits infection with cell-free VZV, which implicates the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR ci ) in facilitating entry of cell-free virus by interacting with viral glycoproteins that contain phosphorylated N-linked complex oligosaccharides (Gabel et al., 1989; Zhu et al., 1995) . Chen et al. (2004) used stable cell lines deficient in MPR ci to show that the protein is required for infection by cell-free VZV (Chen et al., 2004) . However, soluble MPR ci did not bind to viral glycoproteins in ligandblotting assays (Zhu et al., 1995) . Cell lines deficient in MPR ci are not impaired for infection by cell-associated virus; thus, MPR ci is not a cellular receptor for cell-to-cell spread of the virus.
 Studies of HSV-1 and HSV-2 have identified viral and/or cellular proteins required for entry and cell-to-cell spread. Herpes virus entry mediator A, nectin-1 and nectin-2, and 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate have each been established as HSV receptors for entry of cell-free virus (Cocchi et al., 1998; Geraghty et al., 1998; Montgomery et al., 1996; Shukla et al., 1999) . HSV glycoprotein D (gD) has been identified as the viral ligand for each of these receptors. HSV gE/gI, though not essential for entry and replication, sorts nascent virions to cell junctions and is required for efficient cell-to-cell spread of HSV (Collins and Johnson, 2003; Dingwell and Johnson, 1998) . Although a cellular receptor for gE/gI has been postulated, it has not yet been identified.
 VZV encodes at least seven glycoproteins, gB, gC, gE, gH, gI, gK, gL, all of which have well-conserved homologs in HSV (Cohen and Straus, 2001) . In contrast to HSV, VZV does not have a homolog for gD. While HSV gD is one of five glycoproteins in the unique short region of its genome, the corresponding portion of VZV encodes only two VZV glycoproteins, gE and its chaperon gI. Since HSV gD is the receptor binding protein for HSV, and VZV gI is not required for infection by VZV (Cohen and Nguyen, 1997) , VZV gE might be important for binding to a cellular receptor. HSV gE or HSV gD alone do not mediate membrane fusion. The minimum requirement for HSV fusion to cells is the coexpression of four glycoproteins (gD, gB, gH, and gL) and a cell-surface entry receptor specific for gD (Pertel et al., 2001) . Syncytia formation in VZV, a hallmark of cell-to-cell spread, is due to fusion of cell membranes mediated by gH and gL, or gB and gE (Cole and Grose, 2003) . While expression of gH or gB alone induce a modest amount of fusion, expression of gE alone is not sufficient for fusion unless it is coexpressed with gB (Maresova et al., 2001) . Attempts to generate a VZV gE deletion mutant were unsuccessful (Mo et al., 2002) , and a gE minus virus could only be constructed using cells expressing gE (Q.L. and J.C., unpublished data). Taken together, these findings indicate that VZV gE is an essential glycoprotein for VZV. Antibodies to gE neutralize virus in vitro, and immunization with a vector expressing gE protects animals from challenge with virus (Lowry et al., 1992; Wu and Forghani, 1997) . Therefore, VZV gE may be involved in viral entry and cell-to-cell spread and is a likely candidate for binding to a cellular receptor.
 In this study we identified insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) as a cellular receptor for gE. IDE forms a complex with both the purified extracellular domain and the native form of gE in VZV-infected cells. Inhibition of IDE results in reduced VZV infectivity and cell-to-cell spread. Expression of human IDE in nonhuman cell lines that are impaired for VZV infection enhanced virus infection, entry, and binding. These experiments identify IDE as a VZV receptor and confirm the essential role that gE plays in VZV infection.
 The Extracellular Domain of gE Interacts with IDE VZV gE is essential for virus replication and may be important for virus entry. To identify cellular ligands that interact with gE, a soluble form of the extracellular domain of gE fused to human Ig Fc was immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads and used in a pull-down assay with cell lysates from human melanoma cells that are permissive for VZV infection. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie blue. A unique band of about 120 kDa ( Figure 1A ) was pulled down by the gE-Fc fusion protein but was absent from protein lysates incubated with Sepharose alone or control Fc fusion proteins. The band was excised, and sequencing identified the protein as IDE.
 To confirm the interaction of gE with IDE and rule out the possibility of binding to the Fc tag, pull-down assays were performed using truncated gE without an Fc tag (gEt) immobilized onto protein A-Sepharose beads with monoclonal antibody to gE and incubated with lysates from HeLa cells or human T cells. After extensive washing, the beads were boiled in sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE separation, transferred to membranes, and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-IDE antibody. gEt formed a complex with IDE that was detected with antibody to gE in both HeLa and T cells ( Figure 1B , lanes 5-6) but not in HeLa cells when a control antibody was used in place of antibody to gE ( Figure 1B, lane 4) . IDE also bound to gE in VZV-infected melanoma cells. Immunoprecipitation of gE with anti-gE antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-IDE antibody indicated that gE interacted with IDE in VZV-infected but not uninfected cells ( Figure 1B,  lanes 1-3) .
 gB and gH play important roles in viral entry and/or infectivity of herpesviruses. We tested whether IDE interacts with VZV gB, VZV gH, VZV gI, or HSV gE. Lysates from VZV-infected cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to VZV gE, gB, or gH and immunoblotted with anti-IDE antibody. While gE coimmunoprecipitated with IDE, gB and gH did not interact with IDE ( Figure 1C , lanes 7-9). Transfection of CV-1 cells with plasmids expressing VZV gE, VZV gI, or HSV gE followed by immunoprecipitation with the corresponding antibody and immunoblotting with anti-IDE antibody showed that the extracellular domain of VZV gI, which functions as a gE chaperone but lacks sequence homology with gE, also interacted with IDE, although at a much weaker level than gE ( Figure 1C , lanes 1 and 2). This was confirmed using an ELISA-based ligand binding assay. When similar levels of His-tagged soluble gE, gI, or gB were incubated with HA-IDE, the latter bound significantly greater to gE than to either gB or gI over a range of concentrations ( Figure 1D ). HSV gE, which has 32% amino acid identity with VZV gE within a 170 amino acid region, interacted very weakly with IDE ( Figure 1C , lane 4).
 Immunoprecipitation of IDE from infected cells followed by immunoblotting with antibody to gE showed that the amount of gE-IDE complexes increased during the course of VZV infection ( Figure S3 ), which was in parallel with the increasing amounts of gE produced in these infected cells over time, even though the total amount of IDE remained unchanged (data not shown).
 A Portion of IDE that Interacts with gE Is Located on the Plasma Membrane Computer analysis indicates that the predicted sequence of IDE contains a putative amino-terminal signal peptide with a potential cleavage site between residues 22 and 23, and the majority of the sequence might be extracellular; however, a typical transmembrane domain is not apparent (TMHMM program, Technical University of Denmark). Cell fractionation studies showed that IDE is localized primarily in the cytosol (Akiyama et al., 1988) , with a small amount present on the cell-surface plasma membrane (Seta and Roth, 1997; Yaso et al., 1987) . Vekrellis et al. (2000) identified a 115 kDa cell-surface membrane-associated IDE isoform on neuronal cells (Vekrellis et al., 2000) . To verify that IDE is present on the surface of cells, we biotinylated cell surface proteins followed by immunoprecipitation with streptavadin-coated agarose beads and immunoblotting with anti-IDE antibody. A protein of 120 kDa was present on the surface of HeLa and melanoma cells (Figure 2A, lanes 1 and 2) .
 To determine whether gE interacts with IDE on the plasma membrane, cell-surface proteins were biotinylated and incubated with gEt. The IDE-gE complex was immunoprecipitated with gE antibody followed by immunoblotting with streptavidin-conjugated HRP to detect cell surface IDE or anti-IDE antibody to detect total IDE. A portion of the total IDE in the gE-IDE complex was derived from IDE on the cell surface ( Figure 2B , lanes 2 and 6). Controls lacking antibody to gE showed that the IDE-gE interaction was required for detection of IDE on the cell surface in this assay ( Figure 2B, lanes 3 and 4) .
 Anti-IDE Antibodies and Soluble IDE Extracted from Liver Reduce VZV Infectivity and Cell-to-Cell Spread Polyclonal and monoclonal IDE antibodies were tested for their ability to block VZV infection. Commercially available polyclonal anti-IDE antibody PRB-282C and monoclonal antibody 9B12 (Covance, Berkeley, CA) were used. In sev-eral experiments, addition of either antibody (50 ug/ml for 9B12 and 1/200 dilution for PRB-282C serum) to MeWo cells prior to VZV infection resulted in 30%-45% inhibition of virus infectivity ( Figures 3A and 3B) , while a control antibody (anti-CD3) or normal rabbit serum showed little or no effect. Polyclonal antibody ( Figure S4 ) blocked VZV infection in a dose-dependent manner.
 To determine if IDE antibody affects cell-to-cell spread of VZV, we preincubated cells with the polyclonal antibody at 1/100 to 1/200 dilutions at 4 C for 60 min followed by infection with cell-free ROka-lacZ in the presence of the antibody. Three days later the cells were stained with X-gal. IDE antibody markedly reduced plaque sizes compared to the cells treated with control normal rabbit serum The extracellular domain of gE fused to the Fc portion of human IgG (gE-Fc) bound to protein-A Sepharose was incubated with a cell lysate from melanoma cells, and proteins that bound to gE-Fc were resolved on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. A 120 kDa cellular protein is present in the cell lysate that interacts with gE-Fc. (B) gE protein from VZV ROka-infected cells (lane 1) or VZV Molly, a low-passage clinical isolate (lane 2), was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-gE antibody, and IDE was detected in immune complexes. Purified extracellular domain of gE (gEt) immobilized onto protein-A Sepharose beads with anti-gE antibody (lanes 5 and 6) pulls down IDE from cell lysates. (C) Plasmids encoding the extracellular domain of VZV gE (lane 1), gI (lane 2), full-length HSV gE (lane 4), or control vectors (lanes 3 and 5) were transfected into CV-1 cells, and immunoprecipitation with the respective antibodies pull down IDE with VZV gE and, to a lesser extent, with gI. Lysates from VZV-infected cells immunoprecipitated with anti-gE, but not with anti-gB or anti-gH, antibody pull down IDE (lanes 7-9). (D) ELISA plates were coated with HA-IDE and incubated with equal amounts of His-tagged gEt, gBt, or gIt, and binding was assayed using anti-His antibody. HA-IDE binds to gEt significantly greater than to gIt or gBt. Error bars show standard deviations, and t test was used to determine p values.
 ( Figure 3C ). Therefore, IDE antibody inhibits cell-to-cell spread of VZV.
 To determine whether purified soluble IDE can inhibit entry of VZV, we incubated cell-free ROka-lacZ with soluble IDE extracted from liver or uninfected sonicated cell protein as a control, at 37 C for 30 min before infection of melanoma cells. Four days postinfection the cells were stained with X-gal and the number of blue foci, indicative of infectivity by cell-free virus, were scored. Soluble IDE inhibited infectivity by 70%, while control protein had no effect ( Figure 3D ). In three independent experiments, IDE inhibited VZV infectivity by 50%-70%. In contrast, when soluble IDE was added at 1.5 hr after infection, it failed to reduce the number of VZV foci (data not shown), suggesting that soluble IDE extracted from liver blocks VZV entry during the initial stages of infection.
 To determine if soluble IDE extracted from liver affects cell-to-cell spread of VZV, we infected cells with cell-free ROka-lacZ in the presence of soluble IDE or control protein (37.5 mg/ml each) and added the proteins again on the second day of infection. Two days later the cells were stained with X-gal. Soluble IDE markedly reduced plaque sizes compared to the cells treated with control protein or no added protein ( Figure 3E ). Therefore, soluble IDE inhibits cell-to-cell spread of VZV.
 Interestingly, VZV infectivity was enhanced when the virus was pretreated with recombinant soluble IDE (rIDE) produced in a baculovirus expression system ( Figure 3F ). rIDE is initiated from the second ATG of the IDE coding sequence and thus is missing the first 41 amino acids of the protein. Since rIDE is produced in insect cells, it may be processed differently than IDE extracted from liver. The enhancement of VZV infectivity by rIDE supports a role for IDE in an early stage of VZV infection. Several soluble receptor molecules have been described that can either block or promote virus infection, including nectin-1 for HSV (Kwon et al., 2006; Lopez et al., 2001) and sCD4 for HIV (Sattentau and Moore, 1991; Smith et al., 1987) .
 Since IDE interacts with gE, and IDE degrades several proteins, including insulin (Farris et al., 2003; Goldfine et al., 1984) and amylin (Farris et al., 2003; Vekrellis et al., 2000) , we determined whether IDE degrades gE. Incubation of purified IDE with gEt at 37 C for 4 hr did not reduce the amount of the glycoprotein, while IDE degraded insulin when incubated at 37 C for 30 min ( Figure S1A) . Conversely, addition of bacitracin (1 mg/ml), an IDE inhibitor that reduces degradation of insulin and amylin by IDE (Bennett et al., 2003) , did not change the turnover rate of gE in VZV-infected cells during a pulse-chase experiment ( Figure S1B ). These results suggest that IDE is not important for degradation of gE in cells.
 To determine the role of IDE in VZV infection, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to reduce endogenous IDE expression. Human fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) that are susceptible to productive VZV infection were transfected with two independent pools of IDE-specific siRNAs (siRNA-IDE1, siRNA-IDE2) or two independent control siRNA pools (siRNA-1, siRNA-2). At 2.5 days after transfection, half of the cells were harvested for immunoblotting to determine the level of IDE, and the remainder of the cells was infected with cell-free ROka-lacZ. IDE-specific siRNA knocked down the IDE level by about 95% compared with control siRNAs, as calculated by densitometry ( Figure 4A ). To determine the effect of IDE knockdown on VZV infection, the cells infected with cell-free ROka-lacZ were stained with X-gal 4 days later. VZV infectivity in the cells transfected with IDE-specific siRNA was reduced by about 70% compared with the cells transfected with control siRNA ( Figure 4B ). Interestingly, most of the X-gal positive foci in the cells transfected with IDE-specific siRNA consisted of only single isolated blue cells ( Figure 4C , panels 3 and 4); in contrast, larger foci involving multiple cells, due to cell-to-cell spread of virus, were (B) Monolayers of CV-1/EBNA-1 cells were biotinylated for 30 min at room temperature in PBS to label cell-surface proteins. After extensive washing, the cells were lysed and incubated with soluble gEt that had been immobilized on beads using anti-gE antibody. After washing, the beads were boiled in SDS-protein gel solution, and a 120 kDa protein was detected after blotting with Streptavidin-HRP to detect cell-surface IDE, or with anti-IDE to detect total IDE. Lane 9 represents lysate not incubated with beads. present in the cells transfected with control siRNA ( Figure 4C , panels 1 and 2). Knockdown of IDE with siRNA also inhibited infectivity of cell-associated wildtype VZV ( Figure 4D ). Transfection with IDE-specific siRNA did not reduce cell viability compared with control siRNA.
 Bacitracin, which Inhibits IDE, Blocks gE-IDE Complex Formation, VZV Infection, and Cell-to-Cell Spread Since bacitracin inhibits IDE (Bennett et al., 2003) , we examined the effect of the antibiotic on the interaction of gE with IDE, VZV infectivity, and cell-to-cell spread. Bacitracin was incubated with cell lysates in the presence of gEt and immune complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-gE antibody and probed with antibody to IDE. Bacitracin inhibited gEt-IDE complex formation in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5A ). Bacitracin also inhibited the interaction of IDE with gE-Fc fusion protein (G.L. and J.C., unpublished data). Bacitracin inhibited plaque formation of cell-free VZV ROka-lacZ in a dosedependent manner with 90% reduction in infectivity at 5 mg/ml of antibiotic ( Figure 5B ).
 Plaque size in the presence of 1 mg/ml of bacitracin, added either at the time of infection or 8 hr after infection to allow virus entry, was reduced, indicating that the drug also reduced cell-to-cell spread of VZV. This effect was observed in cells infected with either wild-type cellassociated virus ( Figure 5C ) or with vaccine-derived cellfree virus ( Figure 5D ). In contrast, bacitracin did not inhibit either infectivity or cell-to-cell spread of HSV-1, but the same dose of antibiotic inhibited cell-to-cell spread and infectivity of VZV ( Figure 5E ). Bacitracin did not cause apparent cytotoxicity and did not inhibit adenovirus (D) Purified soluble IDE protein extracted from liver (37.5 mg/ml) or anti-gH antibody, but not control soluble protein from uninfected cells, inhibits infectivity in cells infected with cell-free ROka-lacZ. Virus was preincubated with soluble IDE at 37 C for 30 min before infection. Percentage of blue foci is set at 100% for cells infected in the presence of media. P = 0.0004 by ANOVA. (E) Plaque sizes in cells infected with cell-free VZV-lacZ treated with soluble IDE extracted from liver (3), but not medium (1) or control protein (2), are reduced. Magnification of 1003. (F) rIDE, but not BSA control or denatured rIDE (by pH 11.5), enhances VZV infectivity. Cell-free VZV-GFP virus was preincubated with rIDE at 20 mg/ml at 37 C for 30 min before infection. Three days postinfection, GFP-positive foci were counted. P < 0.04 for rIDE versus buffer, denatured rIDE, or BSA. The experiment was repeated with similar results. Error bars show standard deviations. infectivity at the doses used (data not shown). Thus, the effect of bacitracin was specific for VZV and was not seen with HSV-1, another human a-herpesvirus.
 To ensure that the effects of bacitracin on VZV entry and cell-to-cell spread were not due to an effect on virus replication, we performed electron microscopy on VZV ROkainfected cells in the presence or absence of bacitracin. Bacitracin (1.0 mg/ml) was added to melanoma cells at 8 hr postinfection to allow viral entry. The cells were then incubated for an additional 20 hr. Bacitracin did not reduce nucleocapsid formation, virion maturation, transport to the cell surface, or the number of cell-surface virions when compared with untreated controls ( Figure S2 ). These data indicate that bacitracin did not inhibit VZV replication or trafficking to the cell surface.
 To further investigate the function of IDE in VZV infection, we performed a series of gain-of-function experiments. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which do not support productive VZV infection, were transiently transfected with either a plasmid expressing HA-tagged human IDE or empty vector and infected with cell-free VZV-GFP virus. This virus encodes GFP under a CMV promoter so that productive infection is not required for expression of (D) MRC-5 cells were transfected with siRNAs, and, after 2.5 days, the cells were infected with cell-associated wild-type (low-passage, Molly strain) VZV for 1.5 hr and then washed twice to remove the inoculum. The cells were fixed 24 hr after infection, stained with mouse anti-gE antibody, followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, and the number of immunofluorescent foci were counted. The figure represents the results of two independent experiments. Error bars show standard deviations, and t test was used to determine p values. Figure 6A) . A modest amount of virus was able to enter the cells (vector control) in the absence of human IDE, indicating that the cells are not completely defective for entry. Similar results were obtained with mouse melanoma cells (B78H1) infected with VZV (data not shown). Since CHO and mouse melanoma cells do not support productive infection, the ability of human IDE to increase the number of GFP-positive cells after incubation with VZV suggests that the IDE is important for a very early step in virus infection.
 To measure entry of VZV into cells, CHO cells that stably express human IDE (B3 cells), or their parental control cell line, were transfected with a reporter plasmid that encodes GFP under a T7 promoter. The CHO cells were then incubated for 18 hr with melanoma cells infected with VZV-encoding T7 polymerase (ROka-T7). Expression of the T7 promoter-driven GFP is turned on in cells infected with ROka-T7. The level of GFP expression was detected by anti-GFP antibody in immunoblot, and the bands were quantified by densitometry. Cells stably expressing IDE showed a 3-fold increase in GFP expression, indicative of enhanced entry when compared with control cells ( Figure 6B) . A 3-fold increase in GFP expression was also seen when porcine cells (SK-6 A7), which do not support productive VZV infection, cotransfected with the GFP reporter plasmid, and plasmid expressing human IDE or empty vector were used in place of CHO and CHO B3 cells in the assay described above (unpublished data).
 To determine whether exogenous expression of human IDE in CHO cells enhances stable binding of VZV to the cells, we transfected CHO cells with a plasmid expressing (C) Bacitracin inhibits cell-to-cell spread of cell-associated wild-type VZV. Melanoma cells were infected with cell-associated low passage (Molly strain) VZV in the presence or absence of bacitracin (1.0 mg/ml) for 24 hr. Cells were fixed and plaques stained with anti-gE antibody. Cell-to-cell spread was determined by measuring plaque size of virus-infected cells (Collins and Johnson, 2003) . The surface area of photographed plaques in bacitracin-treated (N = 35) and -untreated (N = 51) cells was analyzed by Image J software. P values were calculated using a t test. (D) Bacitracin reduces the size of plaques for melanoma cells infected with cell-free ROka-lacZ (lower panels, two representative fields), compared to cells infected in the absence of the antibiotic (upper panels, 2 fields). Magnification of 1003. (E) Bacitracin reduces the number and size of foci in melanoma cells infected with cell-free ROka-lacZ but not HSV-1-LacZ. Error bars show standard deviations.
 HA-tagged human IDE or control plasmid, and 2 days later, the cells were incubated with radiolabeled cell-free VZV in the presence of heparin at 4 C for 1.5 hr to assay for stable binding. Expression of human IDE increased heparin-resistant binding of VZV to CHO cells by 1.6fold ( Figure 6C ). While the ability of exogenous human IDE to increase VZV infectivity and binding was reproducible, the overall effect was somewhat modest. Endogenous IDE in CHO cells may have interfered with expression of exogenous human IDE and obscured the effect or expression of the human protein.
 Since IDE knockout cells could not be obtained for gain-of-function experiments, we cotransfected human fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) with IDE-specific siRNA to (B) Cells stably expressing human IDE show increased GFP by densitometry after transfection with a reporter plasmid that encodes GFP under a T7 promoter and incubation with cell-associated VZV encoding the T7 polymerase (ROka-T7), when compared with a control cell line that does not express human IDE. The result was repeated in three additional experiments using two different cell lines (CHO and SK6-A7), and the range of enhancement of VZV entry by IDE was 2.2-to 12.5-fold. (C) Transfection of CHO cells with HA-IDE results in increased binding of [ 35 S]methionine labeled cell-free VZV compared with cells transfected with control plasmid. Counts per minute (CPM) were obtained by subtracting those from lysates of uninfected cells from virus-infected cells. The binding assay was performed in the presence of heparin to eliminate the contribution of attachment through cell-surface heparan sulfate. Error bars show standard deviations, and t test was used to determine p values. (D) Cotransfection of MRC-5 cells with control siRNA and plasmid expressing HA-IDE followed by infection with cell-free ROka-lacZ show increased size of infectious foci (panel 2), compared with cells transfected with control siRNA and control plasmid (panel 1). Cells transfected with IDE-specific siRNA and control plasmid and infected with ROka-lacZ show smaller-sized infectious foci (panel 3) than cells transfected with control siRNA and control plasmid (panel 1). Cells transfected with IDE-specific siRNA and plasmid that expresses HA-IDE that is resistant to the siRNA, followed by infection with ROka-lacZ, show increased size of infectious foci (panel 4), compared to cells transfected with IDE-specific siRNA and control plasmid (panel 3). Error bars show standard deviations. knockdown endogenous human IDE and with a modified plasmid expressing human IDE that should be resistant to the IDE-specific siRNA. Plasmid HA-IDE2-2-B was constructed that encodes an HA epitope-tagged human IDE with an altered nucleotide sequence that does not change the predicted amino acid sequence of IDE but should resist downregulation by siRNA IDE-02. Cotransfection of fibroblasts with siRNA IDE-02 and control plasmid, followed by infection with cell-free ROka-lacZ, resulted in reduced size of foci at 4 days after infection, indicative of impaired cellto-cell spread, compared with cells cotransfected with control siRNA and control plasmid ( Figure 6D, lines 1 and  3) . The impairment in cell-to-cell spread was rescued by transfection of cells with plasmid expressing siRNA-resistant IDE (HA-IDE2-2-B) ( Figure 6D, lines 3 and 4) .
 We cotransfected CHO cells with specific siRNA to knockdown endogenous CHO IDE and infected the cells with cell-free ROka-GFP 2 days later. Aliquots of the cells were immunoblotted with anti-IDE Ab to verify the level of IDE protein. Cotransfection of CHO cells with IDE-specific siRNA and a control plasmid resulted in reduced levels of endogenous IDE compared with cotransfection of the cells with control siRNA and control plasmid (Figure 7 , lanes 4 versus 1). VZV infectivity in the cells was low. In contrast, cotransfection of CHO cells with control siRNA and either plasmid expressing unmodified (HA-IDE) or modified (HA-IDE2-2-B) IDE resulted in increased levels of IDE and a corresponding increase in VZV infectivity (lanes 2 and 3). Cotransfection of cells with IDE-specific siRNA and unmodified plasmid (HA-IDE) resulted in a modest increase in IDE levels and virus infectivity compared with control siRNA and control plasmid (lanes 1 and 5). In contrast, cotransfection of cells with IDE-specific siRNA and siRNA resistant plasmid (HA-IDE2-2-B) resulted in a more substantial increase in IDE levels and virus infectivity (lane 6). Thus, the level of VZV infectivity generally correlated with the level of IDE expression.
 Here we show that VZV uses IDE as a receptor for infection with cell-free virus and cell-to-cell spread of virus. While four receptors were identified for HSV, each of these molecules interacts with HSV gD, and VZV lacks a gD homolog. While VZV gE coprecipitated with IDE, HSV gE interacted with IDE much more weakly than its VZV homolog. In addition, while bacitracin blocked IDE and inhibited VZV infection and cell-to-cell spread, the antibiotic did not reduce HSV infection or cell-to-cell spread. Although HSV is closely related to VZV and has many homologous genes, our data suggest that HSV does not use IDE as a receptor. These studies allow us to begin to understand the mechanism of VZV entry and cell-to-cell spread. They also identify gE as a receptor binding protein and confirm a long-standing belief that gE may play an essential role in VZV infectivity, either by cell-free or by cellassociated virus.
 IDE is a member of the zinc metalloproteinase family that was initially implicated in insulin degradation (Duckworth, 1988) . It is highly conserved among different species and has the ability to interact with a variety of functionally unrelated ligands that share little homology in their primary amino acid sequences. In addition to insulin, glucagon, insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), atrial natriuretic peptide, transforming growth factor-a, and b-amyloid protein are substrates for IDE (Duckworth and Kitabchi, 1974; Farris et al., 2003; Hamel et al., 1997; Misbin and Almira, 1989; Muller et al., 1991) . Several other proteins, including epidermal growth factor and IGF-I, bind to IDE but are not hydrolyzed by the enzyme (Duckworth et al., 1998) . It has been hypothesized that these IDE ligands possess common conformational motifs for binding to IDE (Kurochkin, 1998) .
 Several other human viruses also use enzymes as receptors, notably human coronavirus 229E, which uses aminopeptidase N (CD13), and human SARS-associated coronavirus, which uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Aminopeptidase N and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 are, like IDE, members of the zinc metalloprotease family (Delmas et al., 1992; Li et al., 2003) . Interestingly, VZV as well as the two coronaviruses use enzymes as receptors, independent of the activity of the enzyme. Although IDE is predominately a cytosolic protein, it is also present on the plasma membrane (Goldfine et al., 1984; Kuo et al., 1993; Yaso et al., 1987) . It localizes to apical or basolateral regions in different tissues (Kuo et al., 1993) . A novel isoform of IDE is associated with the surface of differentiated, but not undifferentiated, neurons (Vekrellis et al., 2000) . This suggests that IDE may have a role in VZV infection of neurons. IDE is also found in endosomes (Duckworth et al., 1998; Hamel et al., 1991) . HSV has recently been shown to enter certain cells by endocytosis in a pH-dependent pathway (Nicola et al., 2003) . If VZV is endocytosed in certain cells like HSV, then IDE might allow VZV in endosomes to penetrate into the cytosol. The tissue distribution of IDE is ubiquitous (Kuo et al., 1993) , which correlates well with the broad tissue tropism of VZV, especially in vivo.
 Our results provide evidence to confirm the important role of gE in VZV-mediated cell-to-cell spread. A naturally occurring VZV mutant with a point mutation in gE shows accelerated cell-to-cell spread in cell culture and in human cells in SCID-hu mice (Santos et al., 2000) . HSV gE, which is homologous to the VZV glycoprotein, is necessary for directing egress of virus to the basolateral surface of polarized cells (Collins and Johnson, 2003; Dingwell et al., 1994) .
 Compared to other human herpes viruses, VZV is unique in that it is transmitted from host to host as airborne virus, yet it disseminates within the hosts by cell-to-cell spread, similar to the pathway used for spread of virus in cell culture (Arvin, 2001) . Chen et al. (2004) demonstrated that MPR ci is important for cell-free, but not cell-associated, VZV infection. In contrast, IDE functions as a receptor for both cell-free and cell-associated virus. IDE and MPR ci share some common features. Both molecules interact with some of the same ligands, including IGF-I, IGF-II, and epidermal growth factor (Kuo et al., 1993) . At the subcellular level, IDE and MPR ci both localize abundantly in endosomes, a compartment important for VZV trafficking and maturation (Hambleton et al., 2004) . Therefore, IDE and MPR ci might interact with each other to facilitate virus infection. Chen et al. (2004) showed that virus maturation was altered in MPR ci -deficient cells, and cell-free virions were released into the medium in cell culture. In contrast, we did not detect a difference in virus maturation by electron microscopy after treatment with an IDE inhibitor ( Figure S2 ), and inhibition of IDE did not result in release of detectable cell-free infectious virus into the cell-culture media (Q.L. and J.C., unpublished data).
 Many viruses have evolved to use multiple receptors to augment their infectivity. Two observations from our experiments suggest the possibility that VZV may use more than one receptor. First, blocking IDE resulted in only 25%-75% reduction of VZV infection and cell-tocell spread. A similar limit on the maximum degree of inhibitory efficiency has been seen with other viruses that use more than one receptor (Akula et al., 2002; Cocchi et al., 1998; Shukla et al., 1999) . Second, expression of exogenous human IDE in nonhuman cells rendered them more susceptible to VZV infectivity than to virus binding. It is likely that VZV uses another molecule, in addition to IDE, to bind to cells. Investigations are currently underway to identify other cellular molecules that are important for VZV binding and infection.
 In summary, we have identified IDE as a cellular receptor for infection by cell-free and cell-associated VZV. VZV glycoprotein gE, which is essential for virus infection, interacts with IDE through its extracellular domain. Inhibitors of IDE may have a role in the treatment or prevention of VZV infection.
 Human fibroblasts (MRC-5), melanoma (MeWo, from C. Grose, University of Iowa), HeLa, CV-1/EBNA (ATCC, Manassas, VA), T (II-23) cells (from C. Ware, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology) that are susceptible to VZV infection (Zerboni et al., 2000) , B78H1 mouse melanoma cells (from N. Fraser, University of Pennsylvania), CHO cells, B3 CHO cells that express human IDE (Vekrellis et al., 2000) (from R. W. Farris, Harvard University), 3T3, and SK-6 A7 cells (from O. Fuller, University of Michigan), were used.
 VZV strains ROka (recombinant derived Oka), Molly (a low passage isolate), ROka-lacZ (expressing b-galactosidase) , ROka-GFP expressing GFP, or ROka-T7 expressing T7 polymerase (Supplemental Data) were grown in melanoma cells. HSV-1 expressing b-galactosidase was a gift from P. Schaffer (Cai and Schaffer, 1991) .
 Cell-free virus was prepared by scraping cells from flasks in SPGC buffer (10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% sodium glutamate, 5% sucrose in PBS), freeze thawing the cells once, sonicating the lysate, centrifuging the lysate at 1,2403 g for 10 min at 4 C, and transferring the supernatant to a new tube for use as cell-free virus.
 Rabbit polyclonal anti-IDE-1 (provided by R.W. Farris), murine monoclonal anti-IDE 9B12, and rabbit polyclonal anti-IDE antibody, PRB-282C (both from Covance, Berkeley, CA), were used to detect IDE. Soluble IDE protein purified from liver was provided by Dr. R. Bennett (University of Nebraska). Anti-VZV monoclonal antibodies to gE (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), gI, gB (Biodesign, Saco, Maine), and gH (from C. Grose) were used. Bacitracin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in water. Control Fc fusion proteins including P7.5-Fc (encoding the vaccinia 7.5 protein), were provided by M. Spriggs.
 The extracellular domain of gE (amino acids 1-537) was amplified by PCR with SalI and BamHI linkers and inserted into plasmid pDC409 (Giri et al., 1994) to generate plasmid pDC409-gEt. The extracellular domain of gE, along with an in-frame C-terminal human Ig-Fc tag, was cloned into pDC409 to generate plasmid pDC409-gE-Fc. The extracellular domain of gI (amino acids 1-271) was amplified by PCR and cloned into pDC409 to create plasmid pDC409-gIt. PEF6/V5-His-HA-IDE (Vekrellis et al., 2000) encoding HA-tagged human IDE was provided by R.W. Farris. A 3.3 kb (BamHI-NotI) fragment encoding HA-IDE from plasmid pEF6/V5-His-HA-IDE was inserted into baculovirus vector pVL1393 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Plasmid expressing full-length HSV-2 gE (pcDNA3-gE) was provided by J. Weir (FDA, Bethesda, MD).
 CV-1/EBNA cells were transfected with plasmids expressing gEt or gE-Fc using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with low Ig FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT). Five days after transfection, tissue culture supernatants were collected. For biotinylation of cell-surface proteins, cell monolayers were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml of EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS (pH8.0) for 30 min at 25 C followed by three washes with cold PBS.
 RNA Interference and Ligand Binding Assay IDE-specific siRNA SmartPools (siRNA-IDE1 and siRNA-IDE2) and two nonspecific control pools (Duplex-13 and C8-scrumple) were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Each pool contains four individual siRNA duplex sequences. IDE-specific individual siRNA duplex IDE-02 contains sequence ACACUGAGGUUGCAUAUUUUU (sense sequence). Cells were transfected with 100 nM of individual siRNA or siRNA pools using nucleofection (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD).
 Histidine (His)-tagged soluble gE and gI (Kimura et al., 1997) , gB (R. Williams and S. Straus, personal communication), and HA-tagged IDE were each cloned into baculovirus, and proteins were purified from Sf9-infected cells. HA-IDE protein was coated onto 96-well plates at 4 C for 18 hr. After washing, equal amounts of gEt-His, gIt-His, or gBt-His protein (normalized by ELISA using anti-His antibody) were added and incubated at 4 C for 3 hr. The plates were washed, anti-His-HRP secondary antibody was added, TMB one-step substrate (Dakocytomation, Carpinteria, CA) was added, and binding capacity was detected at OD 450 nm by an ELISA reader.

 Graphical Abstract Highlights d Travel surveillance and genomics uncovered hidden Zika transmission d An unreported and 1-year delayed Zika outbreak was detected in Cuba d Mosquito control may delay, not prevent, Zika virus establishment d A surveillance framework to detect hidden outbreaks was created","The recent Zika epidemic in the Americas is a testament to how rapidly mosquito-borne viruses can emerge and spread and has revealed flaws in our surveillance and response systems Morens and Fauci, 2017) . Due, in part, to high rates of subclinical infections and overlapping symptoms with infections from dengue and chikungunya viruses (Mitchell et al., 2019) , Zika virus was circulating for more than a year and a half before it was first detected in Brazil (Faria et al., 2017) . By the time Zika virus was discovered in May of 2015 (Zanluca et al., 2015) and recognized for its ability to cause severe congenital disease (Franç a et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016) , the virus had already spread from Brazil to more than 40 countries (Faria et al., 2017; Grubaugh et al., 2017; Metsky et al., 2017; Thé zé et al., 2018) . By mid-2017, reports from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) (PAHO, 2017a (PAHO, , 2017b revealed Zika virus activity throughout the Americas was waning, prompting predictions for the end of the epidemic (e.g., O'Reilly et al., 2018) and the removal of the World Health Organization's (WHO's) ''Public Health Emergency of International Concern'' status (WHO, 2016a (WHO, , 2016b . More recently, however, new Zika outbreaks have been described across the world (CDC, 2018) , including from Angola, India, Cabo Verde, Vietnam, and Thailand, with some of these resulting from Zika virus introductions from the epidemic in the Americas (e.g., Hill et al., 2019; Lourenç o et al., 2018; Meltzer et al., 2016; Phumee et al., 2019; Ruchusatsawat et al., 2019; Yadav et al., 2019) . These observations would suggest that significant transmission of Zika virus in the Americas could still be ongoing, despite case reporting having come close to zero.
 Coordinated response efforts during the early stages of the Zika epidemic were ultimately contingent on countries detecting cases and reporting them to international health agencies (Lessler et al., 2016) , primarily PAHO (PAHO, 2017a (PAHO, , 2017b . For Zika virus and other Aedes aegypti mosquito-borne virusesincluding dengue and chikungunya viruses-that are primarily transmitted in urban settings and disproportionately impact those with limited resources (Braga et al., 2010; Gardner et al., 2018; Netto et al., 2017; Weaver et al., 2018) , accurate local reporting is especially problematic. Not only are people in poor living conditions more likely to be exposed to infected mosquitoes, but such communities often have less access to adequate healthcare, resulting in more cases going undetected (Hotez, 2016; LaBeaud, 2008) . Pockets of virus transmission that occur in countries with inadequate reporting can therefore facilitate ''hidden'' outbreaks, increasing the risk of infected travelers causing outbreaks in new regions of the world. Thus, underreported or unrecognized local outbreaks may prolong epidemics and hinder global efforts aimed at halting virus spread.
 Infectious disease surveillance of international travelers (''travel surveillance'') has been an effective method for detecting pathogens circulating in resource-limited areas (Hamer et al., 2017; Harvey et al., 2013; Leder et al., 2013 Leder et al., , 2017 Wilder-Smith et al., 2012) . In contrast to local case reporting, travel surveillance relies on diagnosing patients that have acquired infections while traveling outside the country of diagnosis. More recently, approaches of ''genomic epidemiology'' using pathogen sequencing of infected patients have also been used to reconstruct the timing, scale, and dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks (Grubaugh et al., 2019a; Ladner et al., 2019) . As many regions in the Americas affected by the Zika epidemic attract large volumes of international visitors from countries with stronger surveillance systems (Wilder-Smith et al., 2018) , we hypothesized that, by creating a framework integrating local case reporting and travel surveillance with genomic epidemiology, we would be able to uncover potentially still-ongoing Zika outbreaks.
 In this study, we combined travel surveillance, local case reporting, and clinical sequencing of Zika virus from infected travelers to detect virus outbreaks that had previously been missed. We discovered a large Zika outbreak in Cuba that was not reported to PAHO (PAHO, 2017c) or other public health agencies and thus went undetected to the international community. We show that the outbreak in Cuba peaked in 2017, when the epidemic in the rest of the Americas was waning (PAHO, 2017a (PAHO, , 2017b , and estimate that it was at least as large as those in neighboring countries. By recalibrating the dynamics of recent Zika, dengue, and chikungunya outbreaks across the Caribbean, we show that, surprisingly, the Zika outbreak in Cuba was delayed by a full year, which could have been caused by a country-wide vector control campaign. By sequencing Zika virus directly from infected travelers, we show that the establishment of the virus in Cuba itself was delayed, with multiple introductions of Zika virus from other Caribbean islands later fueling the outbreak. Overall, our study creates a combined framework for how travel surveillance and genomic epidemiology can be used as a future surveillance network for detecting hidden outbreaks of worldwide emerging infections and reconstructing transmission dynamics when local reporting is absent, withheld, or otherwise insufficient.
 Zika virus was first detected in Brazil in May 2015 (Zanluca et al., 2015) and had spread to 48 countries by 2016, with case numbers peaking later that year (PAHO, 2017a (PAHO, , 2017b . By mid-2017, new Zika cases were no longer being reported to the international community (PAHO, 2017a (PAHO, , 2017b . Despite the reach and size of the epidemic, however, studies have shown that the epidemic likely started at least 1.5 years prior to its discovery (Faria et al., 2017) . Due to widespread surveillance gaps and inconsistent reporting , we therefore hypothesized that local Zika outbreaks could still be occurring in the Americas, despite not being captured by the international community.
 To investigate whether Zika virus transmission is still ongoing, we used travel surveillance to reveal that local outbreaks were still occurring in 2017, despite relatively few cases being reported ( Figure 1 ). Our data demonstrate that the vast majority of Zika cases during 2017 were the result of an unreported Zika outbreak in Cuba, which occurred while public data suggested the epidemic was nearing its end in the Americas (PAHO, 2017a, 2017b; Figure 1 ).
 To determine whether Zika case reports from international travelers could reveal outbreaks not captured by local case reports, we compared the temporal distribution of local and travel surveillance Zika cases from 2016 to 2018 (Figure 1 ). We obtained monthly suspected and confirmed Zika cases locally reported by individual countries and territories from PAHO. We obtained reports of international travel-associated Zika cases from the Florida Department of Health (FL-DOH) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). We constructed Zika epidemic (epi) curves based on either local or travel surveillance cases and found that they were in strong agreement from South America (Pearson r = 0.917 and 0.976 using FL-DOH and ECDC data, respectively) and the Caribbean (Pearson r = 0.828 and 0.856) and to a smaller extent Central America and Mexico (Pearson r = 0.542 and 0.583). For South America and Central America, we also found concordance for when the last local and travel cases were reported, which was in August and September 2017 ( Figure 1A ).
 We found that the last local case from the Caribbean was also reported in August 2017. However, we observed a spike in Zika cases from travelers returning from this region during the summer of 2017 that were not captured by local reports (Figure 1A) , and Zika-virus-infected travelers from the Caribbean were reported until the end of our reporting period from the ECDC (December 2017) and FL-DOH (October 2018; Figure 1A ). By examining potential source locations for the travel-associated Zika cases in 2017, we found that, between June 2017 and October 2018, more than 98% of them came from Cuba (90 Local and travel-associated Zika cases were used to determine whether outbreaks were still occurring during 2017. (A) Monthly local Zika cases (left y axis) reported by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and monthly travel-associated Zika cases (right y axis) reported by the Florida Department of Health (FL-DOH) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) were sorted by origin of exposure. The vertical lines represent the months the last local and travel cases were reported per region and the month that the World Health Organization (WHO) Public Health Emergency of International Concern status was lifted for the Zika epidemic (November 2017). In each region, travel cases and local cases were correlated (Pearson r range = 0.542-0.976; each comparison can be found in Data S1). (B) The total number of Zika cases reported by the FL-DOH and the ECDC associated with travel originating in the Caribbean are shown (black line) and are shaded by the top 5 origin locations (all other placed in the ''other Caribbean'' category). (C) Zika cases associated with travel from Cuba, diagnosed by the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network, were sorted by month of clinic visit. Travel cases diagnosed by the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network originating from other parts of the Americas are not shown. See also Figure S1 . The data used for this figure can be found in Data S1. Figure 1B ). To further confirm the timing of a Zika outbreak in Cuba, we obtained global travel surveillance data from the US CDC GeoSentinel Surveillance Network (Hamer et al., 2017; Leder et al., 2017) and found that 76% of the Zika cases associated with travel from Cuba were diagnosed in 2017 (22 of 29; Figure 1C) . By analyzing the total air travel volumes from Cuba to Florida and European countries, we found that the increase in passengers from 2016 to 2017 (1.2-1.53; Figure S1 ) does not account for the increase in travel Zika cases from Cuba reported by those countries (5.3-7.23; Figure S1 ). Although our travel surveillance shows that a Zika outbreak peaked in Cuba in 2017 with waning transmission continuing into 2018, during this time period, no local Zika cases were reported by Cuba to PAHO or other international public health agencies (PAHO, 2017c).
 Having uncovered an unreported Zika outbreak in Cuba, we next investigated its size. We created a model using relationships between the local and travel Zika incidence rates and found that it was likely as large as Zika outbreaks on other Caribbean islands that peaked the year prior ( Figure 2 ).
 In the absence of local case reporting, studies have demonstrated that travel surveillance can be used to infer aspects of local virus transmission dynamics (Cauchemez et al., 2014a; Fraser et al., 2009; Schwartz et al., 2008) . Only 187 laboratoryconfirmed Zika cases were reported by Cuba in 2016, and none were reported in 2017 or 2018 (PAHO, 2017c). These reports are inconsistent with the outbreak dynamics that we detected using travel surveillance ( Figures 1B and 2A) . To estimate the number of cases that likely went unreported in Cuba in 2016 and 2017, we first investigated whether travel surveillance accurately reflected the dynamics of known local Zika outbreaks for individual countries and territories outside Cuba. For this purpose, we estimated travel incidence by the number of diagnosed travel Zika cases by the air travel volume between all locations and compared that to the local incidence reported by PAHO (2017a, 2017b; Figure 2A ). We found that, in places with at least 20 travel-associated Zika cases reported ( Figure S2 ), epi curves constructed from travel surveillance were in agreement with epi curves generated from local data reporting (mean Pearson r = 0.769; range = 0.121-0.984; Data S1). We also analyzed cruise ship travel volume but found that it was minimal compared to air travel ( Figure S3 ).
 To approximate the size of the Zika outbreak in Cuba, we next constructed a Bayesian model. We used the mean posterior estimates of the proportion of local to travel incidence from 23 countries throughout the Americas ( Figure S4 ), each individually multiplied by the mean posterior estimates of the Cuba travel incidence rate ( Figure S5 ). Taking the population size of Cuba into account, we estimated that 5,707 Zika cases (interquartile range: 1,071 to 22,611) likely went unreported in this country ( Figure 2B) , with the majority of these cases (>99%) having occurred in 2017. Our results therefore suggest that the 2017 Zika outbreak in Cuba was comparable in size to the known 2016 outbreaks in countries with similar population sizes, such as Haiti (3,103 reported cases), Dominican Republic (5,305 reported cases), and Jamaica (7,165 reported cases; Figure 2C) .
 Our analyses show that the Zika outbreak in Cuba was delayed by approximately a year compared to those elsewhere in the Caribbean (Figure 1 ). To investigate whether such a delay was unexpected, we reconstructed recent Caribbean outbreaks caused by chikungunya virus and found that a 1-year delay of the 2017 Zika outbreak in Cuba was unusual ( Figure 3 ).
 Like Zika virus, chikungunya virus is primarily transmitted by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and is thus governed by similar epidemiological factors (Patterson et al., 2016; Weaver et al., 2018) , resulting in ''wave-like'' outbreaks that are comparable to Zika (Cauchemez et al., 2014b; Grubaugh et al., 2018) . To reconstruct recent outbreaks of chikungunya in the Caribbean, we used the same framework as we did for Zika (Figures 2 and 3A ) and analyzed travel surveillance cases reported by the FL-DOH to create chikungunya epi curves ( Figure 3B ). We found that the chikungunya outbreak in Cuba occurred at the same time (2014) as elsewhere in the Caribbean ( Figure 3B ). This synchrony of chikungunya outbreaks in the Caribbean is in contrast to the 2017 Zika outbreak in Cuba, which was delayed only in this country and not on any of the other Caribbean islands, as they all experienced outbreaks in 2016 ( Figure 3A ). These findings suggest that the delay of the Zika outbreak in Cuba could have been caused by events that were specific to this country during the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic.
 The Establishment of Zika Virus in Cuba Was Delayed and Caused by Multiple Introductions from Other Caribbean Islands Local Zika outbreaks are caused by introductions of the virus from outside areas, with later establishment in resident Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Having shown that the delay in the outbreak in Cuba could have been caused by specific factors in this country, we used genomic epidemiology to investigate the timing and origin of the introduction and establishment of Zika virus in Cuba by sequencing the virus directly from infected travelers. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that the delayed Zika outbreak in Cuba was caused by a delay in the establishment of the virus itself, as opposed to a delay in outbreak dynamics. We also found that the 2017 outbreak in Cuba was caused by multiple introductions of the virus, primarily from outbreaks in other Caribbean islands during the summer of 2016 ( Figure 4) .
 We sequenced Zika virus genomes from nine infected Florida travelers arriving from Cuba during 2017 and 2018 and obtained one Cuban Zika virus genome from GenBank: MF438286. In addition to our previous Zika virus sequences from the 2016 outbreak , we also sequenced four additional genomes from Florida to demonstrate that the Zika virus lineages from Cuba were distinct from those in Florida and thus bona fide travel associated ( Figure 4A ). We openly shared all our sequences as they were generated (https:// andersen-lab.com/secrets/data/zika-genomics/) and combined them with other publicly available sequences for a final dataset of 283 Zika virus genomes (Figure 4 ; Data S2).
 We created phylogenetic trees using time-resolved Bayesian inference ( Figure 4A ; Data S3) and maximum likelihood reconstruction ( Figure S6 ; Data S3). We found that, as expected, the Infections of international travelers were used to estimate the size of the Zika outbreak in Cuba.
 (A) The local Zika virus incidence rates for each country and territory were calculated by the number of locally reported cases per month per 100,000 population. The travel Zika virus incidence rates for each country/territory of presumed exposure origin and reporting country (i.e., travel destination) pair were calculated by the number of travel-associated cases per month per 100,000 air passenger travelers entering the destination country from the origin. When there were at least 20 travel-associated Zika cases ( Figure S2 ), there was a positive correlation between travel and local incidence for all exposure origin and reporting country (i.e., travel destination) pairs (mean Pearson r = 0.769; range = 0.121-0.984; Data S1).
 (B) The number of Zika cases per month (mean, interquartile range, and 95% posterior predictive interval [PPI] ) in Cuba during 2016 to 2017 were estimated by using fitted relationships between estimated local and travel incidence rates in countries with both sets of data to estimate what the local incidence rate in Cuba would have been if local data were available ( Figures S4 and S5 ). This local incidence rate was then used to estimate local per capita incidence rates and subsequent number of Zika cases per month in Cuba.
 (C) The estimated number of Zika cases from Cuba (mean from B) and the total reported number of Zika cases during 2016 to 2017 from all countries and territories in the Americas with Zika virus transmission were plotted with the human population size from each region. Highlighted are the other large Caribbean countries/territories (D.R., Dominican Republic). See also Figures S2, S3 , S4, and S5. The data used for this figure can be found in Data S1.
 Zika virus lineages in Cuba clustered with other virus genomes from the Americas ( Figure 4A) , showing that the outbreak in Cuba was a continuation of the epidemic in the Americas, as opposed to introductions from ongoing Zika outbreaks in Asia Watts et al., 2018) . Based on the placement of the Zika virus genomes, we found evidence for one introduction into Cuba from Central America ( Figure 4B ; clade ''1-Cuba'') and three from the Caribbean ( Figure 4B ; clades ''2-Cuba,'' ''3-Cuba,'' and ''4-Cuba''). These findings suggest that the outbreak in Cuba was primarily fueled by introductions of the virus from other Caribbean islands, which is similar to our observations from the 2016 Zika outbreak in Florida . We next investigated the timing of the establishment of Zika virus in Cuba by estimating the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) using our time-resolved phylogenetic trees (Figures 4A and 4B) . The tMRCAs indicate the coalescence points for each clade and thus estimate the earliest times of establishment of the sequenced virus lineages in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in Cuba that later gave rise to human cases. We found that all our tMRCA estimates for the Cuban Zika virus clades were between July and September 2016 ( Figure 4B ), corresponding to the peak of the Zika outbreaks in other Caribbean islands ( Figures 1A and 4C ).
 By comparing our tMRCA estimates from Cuba to those of other Caribbean islands, we found that the establishment of the virus in Cuba was itself delayed by a year (third quarter 2016 versus mid-2015; Figure 4C ). We then compared our tMRCAs to epi curves created from our travel surveillance and found that the peak of the 2017 Zika outbreak in Cuba occurred 11-13 months after the virus became locally established, which was in agreement to what we found for the 2016 Zika outbreaks in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean as a whole (excluding Cuba; Figure 4C ). Combined, these findings show that Zika outbreaks across the Caribbean peaked a year after successful establishment of the virus in each location and that the delay in the outbreak in Cuba was likely caused by a delay in the establishment of the virus itself.
 Having shown that the postponement of the Cuban outbreak was likely the result of delayed local establishment of the virus (Figure 4 ), we next investigated what factors may have been responsible for this delay. We explored three primary hypotheses: (1) fewer opportunities for Zika virus introductions into Cuba in 2015 when the virus was becoming established elsewhere in the Caribbean ( Figure 4C ), (2) environmental conditions in Cuba from 2015 to 2016 that were unsuitable for Ae. aegyptiborne virus outbreaks, and (3) Ae. aegypti surveillance and control campaigns (Castell-Florit Serrate and Má s-Bermejo, Castro et al., 2017; Gorry, 2016; Reardon, 2016) that limited virus establishment and transmission. To investigate the likelihood of each hypothesis, we examined international travel patterns, yearly transmission of dengue virus (also vectored by Ae. aegypti), local temperature conditions, and news reports. Comparing all three hypotheses, we found that travel patterns and environmental conditions in Cuba could likely have supported a large Zika outbreak in 2016 but that virus establishment, and hence the outbreak, may have been delayed by a countrywide Ae. aegypti control campaign ( Figure 5) .
 Outbreaks of Ae. aegypti-borne viruses, including Zika virus, require opportunities for virus introductions and conducive conditions to support establishing transmission. As air travel is the main source of long-distance virus dispersion Nunes et al., 2014; Semenza et al., 2014) , we analyzed air travel patterns to determine whether Cuba had fewer opportunities for virus introductions early during the Zika epidemic, potentially delaying the outbreak ( Figure 5A ). Using monthly airline passenger arrivals coming from all 48 countries and territories in the Americas known to have local Zika virus transmission from 2014 to 2017, we did not detect any large deviations in air traffic to Cuba during 2015 when Zika virus was becoming established elsewhere in the Caribbean ( Figure 5A ). Moreover, air travel volumes were higher into Cuba than neighboring islands with large outbreaks in 2016, including Puerto Rico and Jamaica ( Figure 5A ). These findings suggest that the delayed outbreak in Cuba was not the result of the country having fewer opportunities for Zika virus introductions than other Caribbean islands early in the epidemic.
 It is possible that conditions in Cuba from 2015 to 2016, unlike other Caribbean islands, were not conducive for Zika virus establishment and large Ae. aegypti-borne virus outbreaks. To explore this scenario, we examined Caribbean outbreaks of another Ae. aegypti-borne virus, dengue virus, using travel Figure S6 . (C) The three separate estimated Zika virus establishment times with tMRCA estimates into Cuba are shown with the Zika virus travel incidence rates (travel cases/ 100,000 travelers; as calculated for Figures 2 and 3) . The estimated earliest Zika virus establishment times (based on the MCC tree in A and travel incidence rates for the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean as a whole [minus Cuba]) are shown to compare the times from establishment of the virus to outbreak peak. See also Figure S6 . GenBank access numbers of Zika virus genomes sequenced during this study can be found in Data S2, the data used to create (A) and (B) can be found in Data S3, and the data used to create (C) can be found in Data S1.
 surveillance that we performed based on data reported by the FL-DOH. We found that dengue outbreaks in the Caribbean were more varied than the Zika and chikungunya outbreaks (Figures 3 Figure 1B) . This was despite other Caribbean islands having both dengue and Zika virus transmission in 2016 ( Figures 3A and 5B ). These findings suggest that, unlike other Caribbean islands, Cuba was not conducive for large Ae. aegypti-borne virus outbreaks in 2016; however, they do not reveal the underlying cause.
 We next investigated whether environmental factors could have been responsible for making the conditions in Cuba nonconducive for Ae. aegypti-borne virus outbreaks in 2016. Temperature is the primary seasonal factor driving Ae. aegypti-borne virus transmission, as it influences mosquito development, survival, reproduction, biting rates, and vector competence Mordecai et al., 2017; Siraj et al., 2017) . To determine whether weather conditions in 2016 could have delayed Zika virus establishment, we used a model that estimated when transmission was most likely to occur based on favorable temperature ranges for mosquito-borne transmission . Using temperature data for Cuba, we found that Ae. aegypti transmission potential was as high in 2016 as it was during prior dengue outbreaks and the Zika outbreak in 2017 ( Figure 5C ). These findings suggest that environmental factors were likely not responsible for delaying the Zika outbreak in Cuba.
 We previously demonstrated that mosquito control campaigns can reduce Ae. aegypti populations and human Zika virus infections . Cuba has a long history of successful Ae. aegypti control (Gubler, 1989 ; Guzmá n and a a a a a a a a a a a a a an n n n n n es s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s st t ta t t t t t t blishmen en en en en en en en e e en en en n nt C C C Cu C C C C C ba a a a es s s s s s s s s s st ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta tablishm men en en en en en e en en e e t t t t t t t t t t t (C) Analysis of dengue and Zika virus incidence, Ae. aegypti transmission potential, and the timing of a reported vector control campaign were used to investigate the delayed Zika outbreak in Cuba. Monthly dengue and Zika virus travel incidence rates (travel cases/100,000 travelers), as reported by the FL-DOH, and relative Ae. aegypti-borne virus transmission potential (mean and 95% confidence interval), determined by a temperature-sensitive model and monthly temperature from Havana, Cuba, were used to judge the impact of the aggressive Ae. aegypti mosquito control program that was reported to have begun in Cuba during February 2016. News reports of Zika and dengue cases and the mosquito control campaign in Cuba are summarized in Data S4. The data used for this figure can be found in Data S1. Kourí, 2009; Toledo et al., 2007) , and following the detection of the Zika outbreak in Brazil, the country implemented a ''National Zika Action Plan'' for aggressive Ae. aegypti mosquito surveillance and control (Castell-Florit Serrate and Má s-Bermejo, Castro et al., 2017; Gorry, 2016; Reardon, 2016) . To investigate whether mosquito control may have played a role in delaying the Zika outbreak in Cuba, we compared the reported start of the mosquito control campaign to the Zika and dengue outbreaks in Cuba ( Figure 5B ). We found that immediately following the reported implementation of mosquito control in February 2016, our travel surveillance showed minimal transmission of both dengue and Zika viruses throughout the year (Figures 5B and 5C ). By searching news articles for Zika and dengue in Cuba from 2015 to 2018, we found that Cuban officials reported that the mosquito control program was successful (Data S4), although we were unable to obtain empirical data to support this claim. The timing of the mosquito control campaign, followed by a decrease in both dengue and Zika cases ( Figures 5B and 5C )-despite high transmission potential ( Figure 5C )-suggests that mosquito control efforts may have been responsible for delaying the establishment of Zika virus in Cuba, thereby leading to a postponement of the outbreak.
 Unrecognized and delayed outbreaks have the risk of ''silently'' spreading viruses to other parts of the world. Using our travel surveillance framework and global suitability for Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, we identified several regions where Zika virus could have been spread from an unrecognized outbreak in Cuba during 2017.
 Based on the occurrence of travel-associated Zika cases reported by the FL-DOH and the ECDC, we found that Zika virus transmission in Cuba was the most intense between June and December of 2017 ( Figure 6A ). We then used this time period to assess where local mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission could have been established from Cuba using global air travel data from Cuba and previously estimated worldwide Ae. aegypti suitability (Kraemer et al., 2015;  Figure 6B ). Out of a total of $4 million air travelers departing Cuba between June and December of 2017, we found 18 countries and US states that received >20,000 travelers, with >100,000 arriving in Florida, Canada, Mexico, and Spain ( Figure 6B ). Based on environmental suitability for Ae. aegypti of the 18 areas with >20,000 travelers from Cuba, we estimated that Florida, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, and Colombia were most at risk of Zika virus having been introduced from Cuba during June-December 2017 ( Figure 6B ). Indeed, four local Zika cases were reported in Florida during 2017, linked to their partners having recently returned from Cuba (FL DOH, 2017a , 2017b . Despite these findings, however, beyond a few cases, no Zika outbreaks were reported in these 18 regions in 2017, perhaps due to existing herd immunity (Netto et al., 2017; Zambrana et al., 2018) . These results show the global connectedness of Zika endemic areas, and with Zika cases associated with travel from the Americas ongoing as of October 2018 (Figure 1) , continued surveillance is required to detect potential further spread.
 Using travel surveillance and virus genomics, we discovered a Zika outbreak in Cuba during 2017, a period in which the epidemic was waning across the Americas (PAHO, 2017a, 2017b; Figures 1 and 2) . A single report about a Zika outbreak in Cuba made the news in 2017 (Reuters, 2017) , but critically, cases were not reported to PAHO (PAHO, 2017c) or other public health agencies and thus went undetected by the international community. With Zika outbreaks still arising in new locations, including Angola, India, Cabo Verde, Vietnam, and Thailand (Hill et al., 2019; Lourenç o et al., 2018; Meltzer et al., 2016; Phumee et al., 2019; Ruchusatsawat et al., 2019; Yadav et al., 2019) , it is important to identify and report lingering outbreaks to better prepare for potential future spread (Bogoch et al., 2016; Kraemer et al., 2017) .
 Epidemiological updates by the WHO (including PAHO) and other public health organizations are the primary methods for disseminating information about infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics. Critically, they rely on accurate case reporting from individual countries and territories, but depending on resources and priorities, reporting of local outbreaks may not be accurate. To overcome some of these limitations, studies based on the detection of infected travelers have been used to fill knowledge gaps about ongoing outbreaks from places that are difficult to sample, as has been previously reported for Zika (Leder et al., 2017; Wilder-Smith et al., 2018) . In this study, we built on this framework to not just detect unreported outbreaks ( Figure 1 ) but to include travel patterns, comparisons to local reports from other locations, and virus genomics to reconstruct outbreaks in the absence of local data.
 The utility of combining travel surveillance with genomic epidemiology, however, is limited to the travel patterns and destinations of the people included in the surveillance network. By also using travel data from Europe, we were able to capture Zika cases from countries that we could not from Florida (Figure 2A ), but we did not detect any infected travelers coming from other known Zika outbreaks in Angola, India, Cabo Verde, Vietnam, and Thailand. Thus, using travelers as sentinels alone cannot provide a complete global picture of ongoing Zika outbreaks, especially when the numbers of cases or travelers are low.
 We estimate that the 2017 Zika outbreak in Cuba was similar in size to outbreaks from other Caribbean islands that peaked the year prior (Figure 2 ). Our analyses utilize the relationships between local cases and travel surveillance from non-Cuba countries, in combination with travel volumes and travel associated cases from Cuba. Other studies have used travelers to estimate local case numbers from influenza (Fraser et al., 2009 ) and Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks (Cauchemez et al., 2014a) by assuming that locals and travelers were equally likely to get infected. Although that assumption may have been correct for those outbreaks, for Zika, we found that epi curves generated based on local or travel data were correlated, but the incidence rates were different by orders of magnitude (Figure 2A ). This suggests that public health systems differ in their ability to detect Zika cases and/or locals and travelers have different risks for Zika infections. For example, because of differences in public health infrastructure and resources, Zika case reporting in Haiti (where our travel incidence is higher than local reporting; Figure 2A) may be less accurate than Puerto Rico (where our travel incidence is lower than local reporting; Figure 2A ; Braga et al., 2017; Dowell et al., 2011) . Additionally, location-dependent factors, such as common tourist behaviors and lengths of stay, could also alter the risks for traveler infection (Cauchemez et al., 2014a; Fraser et al., 2009 ). Thus, our approach of using the relationship between local and travel incidence data from locations with local reporting as a calibration might be a more accurate method for reconstructing Zika outbreaks than using travel incidence alone.
 There are limitations to our approaches that may influence our ability to estimate the size of the Zika outbreak in Cuba. First, accurate travel data are necessary to calculate travel incidence rates of Zika cases. This is challenging for Cuba, as travel policies from the United States have repeatedly changed during the past few years (Robles, 2016) , and we found that travel volumes between Cuba and Florida increased in 2017 compared to 2016 ( Figure S1A ). To minimize this issue, we included air travel from both scheduled commercial flights from the International Air Transportation Association (IATA, 2018) and chartered flights from the US Department of Transportation (US DOT, 2018). We also obtained travel surveillance data from Europe, where the travel policies to Cuba have not recently changed, with travel volumes remaining relatively stable ( Figure S1A ). As we previously showed that cruise ship traffic greatly outnumbered airline traffic during the 2016 Zika outbreak in Florida , we also investigated cruise ships to Cuba; however, we found their travel volume to be much smaller than airlines for this country ( Figure S3 ). Second, our size estimates are based on averaging across all regions, some of which may be more, or less, representative of the Zika outbreak in Cuba. Although we found a strong correlation between epi curves generated from travelassociated Zika cases and local reporting, variability in the ratio between local and travel incidence among countries resulted in a wide interquartile range (1,071 to 22,611) on our mean estimate of 5,707 unreported Zika cases in Cuba. Our mean estimate, however, is consistent with the only two public reports from the outbreak in Cuba of 187 cases in 2016 reported by PAHO (PAHO, 2017c) and 1,847 cases in 2017 reported by the news agency Reuters (Reuters, 2017) . Zika outbreaks from other locations in the Americas with comparable population sizes to Cuba were also reported to be similar in size, which would still be true even at the lower end of our interquartile range ( Figure 2C ).
 By sequencing Zika virus genomes from travelers infected in Cuba, we demonstrate that the 2017 outbreak peaked 11-13 months after the virus was established, a time frame that was consistent for other Zika outbreaks in the Caribbean (Figure 4C ). Other studies from Brazil, Central America, and Mexico have found similar patterns (Faria et al., 2017; Thé zé et al., 2018) . This suggests that the amount of time necessary for newly established Zika virus lineages to intensify in transmission to reach peak outbreak size will often require maintenance of the virus during seasons when mosquito abundance is low (e.g., by vertical transmission; Thangamani et al., 2016) . Although the factors supporting virus maintenance are still unclear, it is plausible that Zika virus may survive low mosquito abundance through a combination of low-level mosquito-to-human transmission, vertical transmission in mosquitoes (da Costa et al., 2018; Thangamani et al., 2016) , and, to a lesser extent, human sexual transmission (Althaus and Low, 2016) . Considering that all known large Zika outbreaks in the Americas, including Cuba, may have involved prolonged virus maintenance, a better understanding of how Zika virus is maintained during low mosquito abundance could lead to novel vector control and outbreak mitigation strategies.
 By reconstructing other Ae. aegypti vectored outbreaks, analyzing climatic conditions, investigating news reports, and modeling mosquito abundance, our study suggests that the establishment of Zika virus in Cuba may have been delayed by an Ae. aegypti control campaign ( Figure 5C ). This accomplishment highlights the value of mosquito control for limiting transmission , as Cuba may have been able to reduce the local burden of both dengue and Zika, despite otherwise conducive environmental conditions to support transmission of the viruses ( Figure 5B ). Publicly available reports indicate that the response to Zika by Cuban authorities intensified in early 2016 and included active and passive surveillance, training of health professionals, communication and mobilization, and the application of adulticides and larvicides for mosquito control (Castell-Florit Serrate and Má s-Bermejo, Castro et al., 2017; Gorry, 2016; Reardon, 2016) . This strategy was built upon years of effective dengue control through capacity building and research (Guzmá n, 2005; Guzmá n and Kourí, 2009). Although our observation of the suppression of both dengue virus transmission and Zika virus establishment during periods that we found were otherwise suitable for Ae. aegypti-borne transmission ( Figure 5C ) suggests that the mosquito control campaign was successful, we were unable to obtain empirical data to confirm these findings. Competition between dengue and Zika viruses-as previous exposure to dengue virus may protect against Zika virus infections in humans (Gordon et al., 2019; Rodriguez-Barraquer et al., 2019 )-may also have played a role in delaying the establishment of Zika virus in Cuba. However, how cross-protection, or other epidemiological interactions (Vogels et al., 2019) , between these two flaviviruses may impact outbreaks is not currently clear, and such potential virus ''competition'' would likely not be unique to Cuba. For future studies, accurate data on Zika virus seroprevalence in Cuba and other Caribbean islands would be helpful to address these questions. In addition, the availability of empirical mosquito abundance data would allow for an assessment of yearto-year differences in transmission potential and to specifically test whether Ae. aegypti populations were reduced during the control campaign in Cuba, as we previously observed in Florida . Importantly, vector abundance studies, including making such data publicly available, should be prioritized and more fully supported for future mosquito-borne virus outbreaks (Rund and Martinez, 2018) .
 During rapidly evolving outbreaks, a lack of access to reliable local data can often limit response efforts. By combining travel surveillance with genomic epidemiology, we were able to reconstruct infectious disease outbreaks when local reporting was insufficient. This framework can be applied more generally to detect hidden outbreaks, and future applications may include the integration of empirical data on vector abundance and population immunity. By combining data and resources across multiple scales, we can thus develop surveillance frameworks to uncover epidemiological dynamics of emerging, re-emerging, and endemic infectious diseases across the world.

 Ethical statement This work was evaluated and approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) at The Scripps Research Institute. This work was conducted as part of the public health response in Florida and samples were collected under a waiver of consent granted by the FL-DOH Human Research Protection Program. The work received a non-human subjects research designation (category 4 exemption) by the FL-DOH because this research was performed with remnant clinical diagnostic specimens involving no more than minimal risk. All samples were de-identified before receipt by the study investigators, and information regarding the age and sex and/or gender were not provided.
 Local cases and incidence rates PAHO is the primary source for information regarding Zika virus spread in the Americas, as well as suspected and confirmed cases per country and territory (PAHO, 2017a). Weekly case counts, however, are made available as cumulative cases, not the number of new cases per week. These data are often problematic for reconstructing outbreak dynamics because of reporting delays and 'spikes' (e.g., more than one week of cases submitted after weeks of no reporting). Curated weekly case counts per country and territory are presented as bar graphs (not as datasheets) (PAHO, 2017a) . Therefore, to increase the accuracy of calculating Zika virus incidence rates, we captured screenshots of the 2016-2017 weekly Zika virus case (suspected and confirmed) distributions, and extracted the case counts using Web Plot Digitizer v3.10 (https://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer), which we previously validated . Extracted case numbers were recorded in .csv files and aggregated per month for this analysis. Yearly human population numbers were retrieved from the United Nations Population Division (https://population.un.org/wpp/) and were used to calculate monthly local Zika virus incidence rates (suspected and confirmed Zika cases/100,000 population) per country and territory. Monthly Zika cases and incidence rates are available at: https://github.com/andersen-lab/paper_2018_cuba-travel-zika.
 The Zika-Epidemiological Report for Cuba (PAHO, 2017c) , which was last updated on 25 September 2017, states: ''Between EW [epidemiological week] 1 and EW 52 of 2016, a total of 187 laboratory confirmed cases of autochthonous Zika virus disease were reported. No information is available on the distribution of cases by epidemiological week. No new information was provided since EW 52 of 2016.'' This shows that Zika cases from Cuba were not reported to PAHO in 2017.
 Weekly cumulative travel-associated Zika, dengue, and chikungunya case numbers were collected from 2014-2018, and are publically available from the FL DOH (FL DOH, 2018) . The cases reported on the FL DOH database include those that were confirmed by both PCR and serological assays, and within and without symptoms onset dates (note that many of the pregnant women that were serologically positive for Zika virus were asymptomatic). A travel history was also recorded for most patients. For this study, we only included PCR positive cases with a known date for the onset of symptoms and who only traveled to one international location within the 2 weeks prior to symptoms onset so we could more accurately sort the temporal and spatial distribution of travel-associated cases. We also excluded cases with sexual or congenital exposure. We aggregated the data by month of symptoms onset and by location of likely exposure (i.e., travel origin). Of the travel-associated Zika cases diagnosed in Florida (n = 1,333), 49% were visiting friends and relatives, 17% were refugees or immigrants, 17% were traveling for tourism, 3% were traveling for business, and 14% were traveling for unknown or other reasons. Of the travel-associated dengue virus cases where the questionnaire was given (only started for dengue in 2016, n = 88), 67% were visiting friends and relatives, 25% were traveling for tourism, and 8% were traveling for other reasons.
 We also requested travel-associated Zika cases from the ECDC European Surveillance System (TESSy) (ECDC, 2017) . We requested all travel-associated Zika cases reported to the ECDC during 2016-2017, sorted by month of symptoms onset, reporting country, and location of likely exposure. The data was provided by Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, and released by ECDC. The raw travel-associated case counts from Europe has not been published, was obtained through specific request from the ECDC, and we do not have permission to make it public. In addition, the views and opinions that we expressed herein do not necessarily state or reflect those of ECDC. The accuracy of our statistical analysis and the findings we report are not the responsibility of ECDC. ECDC is not responsible for conclusions or opinions drawn from the data provided. ECDC is not responsible for the correctness of the data and for data management, data merging, and data collation after provision of the data. ECDC shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data.
 Data on travelers to Cuba diagnosed at GeoSentinel sites were also analyzed. The GeoSentinel Global Surveillance Network consists of 72 specialized travel and tropical medicine clinics in 32 countries, and is staffed by specialists in travel and tropical medicine (https://www.istm.org/geosentinel). The GeoSentinel clinics provide routine clinical care to ill travelers and contribute de-identified demographic, travel, and clinical surveillance data on patients with travel-related illnesses to a centralized database (Harvey et al., 2013; Leder et al., 2013) . Patient records with Cuba listed as the country of exposure and a diagnosis of mosquito-acquired Zika virus infection were extracted from the GeoSentinel database for the time period January 1, 2016 to November 12, 2018. Only confirmed cases were included in this analysis; these were defined as Zika virus PCR-positive in serum or urine, or Zika virus-specific IgM in serum and Zika virus antibody titers greater than four-fold higher than antibody titers for dengue or other flaviviruses or a fourfold rise in anti-Zika virus IgG and Zika virus antibody titers greater than four-fold higher than antibody titers for dengue or other flaviviruses (Hamer et al., 2017) .
 Monthly travel incidence rates from all exposure (origin) and reporting (destination) combinations were calculated by number of travel-associated cases per 100,000 airline passengers (from origin to destination/month). Exposure-reporting combinations that accounted for less than 20 imported cases were not included in analysis. Air travel data was obtained as described below.
 Though we previously hypothesized cruise ships may have an underrecognized role in Zika virus spread , we did not use data from Zika virus infections that may have been associated with cruise travel, and thus did not collect cruise ship data for this study. First, there were very few infections linked to cruise travel in our dataset, which may be because these cases would more likely be tourists diagnosed elsewhere (and just visiting Florida for the cruise departure). Second, many of the reported cruiserelated Zika infections were associated with more than one site for potential exposure, making it difficult to estimate local incidence rates (we removed all travel cases with multiple locations of potential exposure from our analyses). Third, scheduled cruise ship passengers arriving in Florida that stopped in Cuba are predicted to be substantially fewer (11,675/month scheduled for 2019; crawled from CruiseMapper: https://www.cruisemapper.com/) than air travel passengers from Cuba to Florida (80,366/month in 2017) ( Figure S3 ). Cruise travel between Cuba and Florida only began in 2016 (Vora, 2016) , and thus there would have been even fewer passengers during our primary study period between [2016] [2017] .
 The travel incidence rates derived from data collected from the FL DOH and ECDC and the curated travel-associated cases from Florida are available at: https://github.com/andersen-lab/paper_2018_cuba-travel-zika.
 We collected air passenger volumes to calculate Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus travel incidence rates, to assess the potential for Zika virus importations into Cuba, and to investigate potential Zika virus spread from Cuba. From the IATA (IATA, 2018), we obtained the number of passengers traveling by air between all destinations in the Americas, plus to all global destinations from Cuba, from [2010] [2011] [2012] [2013] [2014] [2015] [2016] [2017] . IATA data consists of global ticket sales which account for true origins and final destinations, and represents 90% of all commercial flights. The remaining 10% of trips are modeled using airline market intelligence. One limitation of IATA data is it does not include chartered flights, which through our investigations, was only an issue for flights to and from the United States and Cuba. To make up for this, we obtained chartered flight data from Cuba to Florida during 2014-2017 from the U.S. DOT (US DOT, 2018). The US DOT publicly reports the number of passengers on all commercial and chartered flights departing and arriving in airports in the United States and includes origin and destination. Summarized air passenger volumes are available at: https://github.com/ andersen-lab/paper_2018_cuba-travel-zika.
 We used two data types-locally acquired cases by country and Florida travel cases by country-to inform estimates of per capita local incidence in Cuba on a scale comparable to local incidence in other countries. We limited our analysis of countries besides Cuba to those with a correlation between monthly local and travel cases > 0.25 (n = 27), which appeared to be a natural breakpoint in the distribution of correlations. For each, we used the fda (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fda/index.html) package in R to model per capita local incidence of Zika over time with univariate cubic B-spline functions with four knots per year for two years (2016) (2017) described by parameters q. We assumed that incidence among travelers from each country followed the same temporal pattern as local incidence but the two differed in magnitude by a factor m, which could be due to differences in exposure or healthseeking behavior between international travelers and the general population. To estimate q and m for each of the 27 countries, we modeled local and travel incidence for each month as independent binomial random variables, with incidence as the number of ''successes'' and country population and number of travelers, respectively, as the number of ''trials.'' Logit-transformed values of the spline functions informed the probability of success in each trial. Based on this likelihood formulation and with non-informative priors, we estimated q and m for each country using a Metropolis-Hastings implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We assessed convergence by calculating Gelman-Rubin statistics on five replicate chains, and we performed posterior predictive checks on cumulative local incidence ( Figure S4 ) and travel incidence ( Figure S5 ) (Thompson Hobbs and Hooten, 2015) . On the basis of Bayesian p-values < 0.05 on these posterior predictive checks, we removed four countries from subsequent analyses (leaving n = 23 countries). To estimate per capita local incidence in Cuba, we first estimated q for Cuba in a similar manner, but based on travel data only. We then took 10 4 values of m drawn randomly from the posteriors of m pooled across 23 countries and multiplied them by random samples from the posterior of per capita travel incidence curves from Cuba to obtain a set of 10 4 predictions of per capita local incidence curves for Cuba. R code and posterior samples are available at: https://github.com/andersen-lab/ paper_2018_cuba-travel-zika.
 To investigate the potential for Zika virus transmission and establishment, we used previously generated Ae. aegypti suitability maps (Kraemer et al., 2015) based on the statistical relationships between mosquito presence and environmental correlates (Bogoch et al., 2016) . Maps were produced at a 5-km 3 5-km resolution for each calendar month and then aggregated to the level of the U.S. states, countries, and territories, as used previously (Gardner et al., 2018) . Relative Ae. aegypti suitability (i.e., very low, low, mid-high, and high) was then derived by using the mean aggregated values for each U.S. state, country, and territory, and also the mean value for the study period (June-December, 2017). The U.S. state, country, and territory suitability means and standard deviations can be found at: https://github.com/andersen-lab/paper_2018_cuba-travel-zika.
 Statistical analyses were performed using BEAST and R and are described in the Figure legends and in the Method Details.

Increase in Travel Zika Cases from Cuba Is Not Due to an Increase in Travel, Related to Figure 1 To assess if the 2016 to 2017 increase in Zika cases reported from travelers who recently visited Cuba were due to a Zika outbreak in Cuba or an increase in air travel passengers leaving Cuba, we compared the yearly travel volumes from Cuba to Florida, Spain, and Italy to the travel Zika cases from Cuba reported by the same countries during 2016 and 2017. The greater increase from 2016 to 2017 of travel cases compared to travel volume suggests that a Zika outbreak in Cuba was the cause. To determine the number of travel-associated infections needed to infer the shape of a local outbreak, we compared the total travel-associated Zika cases from each exposure-reporting country/territory combination (x axis) with Pearson correlation between the local and travel incidence rates corresponding to the combination (y axis). The travel-associated Zika cases were totaled from 2016-2017. For the Pearson correlations between local-travel incidence rates, monthly incidence values from 2016-2017 were compared. When there were > 20 travel-associated cases, the local-travel Pearson r was > 0.5, indicating a strong positive correlation and that the travel cases can help determine the shape of the local outbreak. The lone exception to that finding was from travelers from Barbados diagnosed in the United Kingdom (UK) because the travel cases miss the locally reported Zika virus peak during January-February, 2016, but they correlate with the second local peak during July-October, 2016 ( Figure 2A ). In our dataset, there were 25 Zika virus infections diagnosed in Italy with recent travel to Cuba, 30 diagnosed in Spain, and 98 diagnosed in Florida. These totals are all within the range of strong positive correlations between local and travel incidence, justifying their use to infer the local Zika outbreak dynamics in Cuba ( Figure 2B ).",be36beee88c55d250244adaa51230cd33a94afa2,2019-08-22,"Grubaugh, Nathan D.; Saraf, Sharada; Gangavarapu, Karthik; Watts, Alexander; Tan, Amanda L.; Oidtman, Rachel J.; Ladner, Jason T.; Oliveira, Glenn; Matteson, Nathaniel L.; Kraemer, Moritz U.G.; Vogels, Chantal B.F.; Hentoff, Aaron; Bhatia, Deepit; Stanek, Danielle; Scott, Blake; Landis, Vanessa; Stryker, Ian; Cone, Marshall R.; Kopp, Edgar W.; Cannons, Andrew C.; Heberlein-Larson, Lea; White, Stephen; Gillis, Leah D.; Ricciardi, Michael J.; Kwal, Jaclyn; Lichtenberger, Paola K.; Magnani, Diogo M.; Watkins, David I.; Palacios, Gustavo; Hamer, Davidson H.; Gardner, Lauren M.; Perkins, T.

Viruses exploit host cell mechanisms throughout their life cycle, from entry to replication, assembly and egress, and finally maturation. Each step in this cycle is a potential point for antiviral intervention. Our knowledge of ISG effector functions has been somewhat biased toward inhibition of early replication stages, such as entry, or viral translation initiation. In this study, we established a screen that would also uncover host factors inhibiting late stages of the viral replication cycle, using IAV as a model virus. Red, transduced cells; green, infected cells; blue, DAPI-stained nuclei. ( B) Effect of 401 single ISGs on IAV spread. ISGs inhibiting more than 2-fold SD in two independent screens are shown in red. Spread ratio, the ratio of infected cells at 24/8 hpi. A positive control for inhibition is a-HA antibody. ( Data are represented as mean ± SEM from n = 6 values in two independent experiments for A549, and n = 3 for NHBE cells. '' Spread ratio'' was calculated from the number of infected cells at 24 hr post-infection (hpi) relative to 8 hpi for each ISG ( Figures  1A and S1A ). All but FAM46C, which did not inhibit virus spread on NHBE cells, were confirmed as antiviral ( Figure 1C ). This versatile SERPIN family member has been implicated in many physiological processes, including regulation of fibrinolysis (reviewed in Declerck and Gils, 2013) . In A549 cells, SERPINE1 mRNA was slightly upregulated upon IFN-b stimulation and following infection with IAV WSN/33 ( Figure 2A ). Stimulation of SERPINE1 gene expression led to increased intracellular and extracellular levels of PAI-1 ( Figures 2B, 2C , S2E, and S2F). However, PAI-1 is further upregulated by certain stimuli, including virus infection. Strikingly, we found that addition of a-PAI-1 antibody to A549 cells during infection significantly enhanced IAV spread compared to the IgG control ( Figure 2E ). Infectivity of IAV progeny particles requires a maturation cleavage of the viral hemagglutinin (HA0 to HA1 and HA2), catalyzed by host proteases (Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975; Skehel and Waterfield, 1975) . Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), a major target of PAI-1, formed a complex of $85 kDa with rPAI-1, but not in the presence of the PAI-1 inhibitor triplaxtinin ( Figure 3A ). To allow multiple rounds of IAV infection in cells lacking endogenous HA-cleaving proteases, such as A549, trypsin is typically added in low concentrations to the tissue culture medium. In contrast, we were unable to detect complexes of PAI-1 and furin, although this interaction has been previously reported (Figure S4) (Bernot et al., SERPINE1* encodes a catalytically inactive PAI-1 due to a single point mutation in the reactive center loop and served as a loss-of-function negative control (Lawrence et al., Fold increase over pre-treatment control levels is shown.

Data are shown as mean ± SEM from at least n = 6 replicates from 2 independent experiments. One-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis post-test. Serpine1 was transcriptionally upregulated in B6 mouse lungs upon IAV infection ( Figure 5B ). However, given the role of PAI-1 in blocking viral maturation, the levels of infectious virus particles (Figures 5F and 5I) are a more relevant measure. Serpine1 À/À lungs were increased in size at 5 days post-IAV infection, with enhanced necrosis compared to lungs from B6 (B) BHK cells were transfected to express GFP as negative control, PAI-1 wild-type (SER1), or loss-of-function mutant (SER*) and then challenged with IAV Puerto Rico/8/1934 in the presence of TPCK-trypsin. Specific infectivity was determined by calculating the ratio of FFU to vRNA copies, and values were normalized to GFP control. (legend continued on next page) controls ( Figure 5A ). Bleeding into alveoli was slightly enhanced in infected Serpine1 À/À lungs at 4 dpi, which might be expected given PAI-1's role in fibrinolysis ( Figure S5C ). A43T), resulting in substitution of alanine by threonine (PAI-1 p. A15T) and partial intracellular retention of PAI-1. PAI-1 is present in plasma, platelets, and the extracellular matrix and is secreted by endothelial, smooth muscle, and immune cells in different tissues, including the airway. Cells were then challenged, and virus infectivity was analyzed as described in (B) . ( F) HA cleavage assay on HAEC infected with IAV WSN/33 in the presence of either rPAI (1) or a-PAI-1 (2) and buffer (1) or IgG (2).

( Data are shown as mean ± SEM from n = 32 infected B6 or Serpine1 À/À mice, and n = 3 respective PBS control animals. We could not find evidence for inhibition of furin by PAI-1. Less pathogenic IAV HAs, in contrast, contain a single arginine residue in their cleavage site, which makes them dependent on cleavage by extracellular airway proteases, such as TMPRSS2. This was not the case for highly pathogenic H5N1 virus (Sakai et al., Not surprisingly, HA cleavage has been proposed as a target for antiviral therapy. The efficacy of applying these molecules to restrict IAV has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo and validates HA cleavage inhibition as an attractive antiviral strategy. Mucus acts as a physical extracellular barrier. Mucins are present in airways at constitutive levels but are upregulated during inflammation (Turner and Jones, 2009). We now add PAI-1 as an additional component of this extracellular barrier. Statistical significance was determined by two-way ANOVA. In conclusion, we identify SERPINE1/PAI-1 as a host factor inhibiting IAV spread and show that PAI-1 mechanistically acts by blocking maturation of progeny IAV particles, thus reducing particle infectivity. IAV production from non-transduced cells masked potential inhibitory effects of ISGs and was eliminated by adding puromycin 1 hr prior to IAV infection. Mice were housed in an AAALAC-accredited facility in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All procedures outlined in the study were approved by The Rockefeller University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Target rPAI-1 levels in this experiment were chosen to reflect physiological concentrations, at 25 or 12.5 ng/ml, respectively. When indicated in the respective figures, we modified the HTM protocol regarding cell type, virus and timing of time points. Primer sequences can be found in Table S3 . For infection of human fibroblasts, we used DMEM, 0.3% protease-free BSA (Sigma), 0.1% FBS, Pen/Strep, and 1mg/ml TPCK-trypsin. Cells were harvested 20h post-transfection, lysed and assayed using Dual Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega). At 48h post-transfection, MEM was replaced by fresh MEM, MEM containing 5 mg/ml TPCK, or MEM containing a mix of 5 mg/ml TPCK and 20 mg/ml rPAI (previously incubated for 1h at 37 C). For cleavage assays in the presence of TMPRSS2, BHK cells were transfected with 3 mg of respective HA plasmid, and 3 mg of SERPINE1/SERPINE1* plasmid plus 1 mg TMPRSS2 plasmid. At 48h post-transfection, 5 mg/ml trypsin were added to the control well for 30 min. Supernatants were collected for plaque assay and vRNA at 24hpi. For VSV strain Indiana, 10 5 PFU per mouse were administered intranasally. Clinical signs were assessed by visual inspection, as well as daily weighing of the animals. Animals that became moribund and lost > 25% of their body weight as compared to day 0 were immediately euthanized.

The evidence for increased transmission of infectious diseases at international sporting mass gatherings that attract many visitors from all over the world is not clear, and the evidence base for public health surveillance, epidemiology, and response at events such as the Olympics is small. However, infectious diseases are a recognised risk, and public health planning is, and should remain, a crucial part of the overall planning of sporting events. In this Series paper, we set out the planning and the surveillance systems that were used to monitor public health risks during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in the summer of 2012, and draw attention to the public health issues-infectious diseases and chemical, radiation, and environmental hazards-that arose. Although the absolute risk of health-protection problems, including infectious diseases, at sporting mass gatherings is small, the need for reassurance of the absence of problems is higher than has previously been considered; this could challenge conventional public health surveillance systems. Recognition of the limitations of health-surveillance systems needs to be part of the planning for future sporting events.
 We searched PubMed, Medline, and Embase using the search terms ""mass gatherings"" or ""crowds"" in combination with the terms ""sporting events"" or ""Olympics"". We selected publications from the past 5 years, but did not exclude commonly referenced and highly regarded older publications. We also searched the reference lists of articles identifi ed by this search strategy and selected those we deemed relevant. Review articles and websites on mass gatherings and sporting events are cited to provide readers with more details and more references than can be supplied in this paper. We searched only articles published in English.","Mass gatherings are seen as potential risks for transmission of infectious diseases, 1 and might be expected to compromise the health system of the city, country, or region in which they are held. This risk and expectation is clearly true for the yearly Hajj in Saudi Arabia, where infectious diseases have been a major problem and where substantial eff ort is now made by the host country's authorities to mitigate and manage the risk. 2 The evidence for the risk of transmission at international sporting mass gatherings-such as the Olympic Games and World Cup-is not clear, but nevertheless public health planning and response are an essential part of the overall planning for these events.
 Although reports on the epidemiology of individual mass gatherings have been published, these have been neither comprehensive nor extensive. In this Series paper, we present the planning and surveillance systems used by UK authorities to monitor public health risksincluding infectious diseases and chemical, radiation, and environmental hazards-during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games (known collectively as the 2012 Games), and draw attention to the public health issues that arose and some of the lessons identifi ed from these.
 During the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, infectious diseases accounted for less than 1% of health-care visits. 3 Data for the Attica region in Greece (in which Athens is located) during the Athens 2004 Games showed that, of the health problems for which people visited a primary-care physician, the most common were respiratory infections (6•7%) and gastroenteritis (3•7%) . Across all four regions where the Games were located, in areas representing 51% of Greece's population, salmonellosis accounted for about 50% of the mandatory notifi cations, tuberculosis 17%, hepatitis B 5%, aseptic meningitis 4%, and bacterial meningitis 3%. Recorded morbidity from infectious diseases was very low (2-3%). 14 small clusters (2-4 people) and eight large clusters (6-38 people) of foodborne or waterborne disease were reported in August, 2004. None of these outbreaks was reported from an Olympic venue, highlighting the tendency for all events in an Olympic City during the Games to be labelled as Olympics-related. 4 In disease outbreaks were reported. 5 Enhancement of health-protection measures, particularly food safety and hygiene along the entire food-supply chain, might have caused an absolute decrease in morbidity. 6 However, the experience of the Democratic National Convention in Boston, MA, USA, where a reduction in health attendance was also noted during the event, suggests that movement of the resident population out of the mass-gathering environment might also partly explain the reduction in reported cases of communicable diseases.
 Changes in normal catering and food-preparation systems during mass gatherings-such as the introduction of temporary or mobile food outlets or catering environments where good standards of hygiene are diffi cult to maintain-can lead to an increase in the risk of contaminated food and water causing incidents and outbreaks of gastrointestinal diseases. Several gastrointestinal incidents have been reported from mass gatherings such as festivals and sports events. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Respiratory illnesses have always been major concerns for mass gatherings, as evidenced by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Indeed, airborne spread of microorganisms in the context of a mass gathering could result in not only respiratory tract diseases but also clusters of diseases such as measles, mumps, and meningococcal infection. 13 Infl uenza has frequently been recorded at sporting and music events such as the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, UT, USA, 14 and music festivals in 2009 in Belgium, 15 Serbia, 16 and Hungary, 17 and also at the World Youth Day in Sydney, NSW, Australia, in July, 2008. 18 However, sustained control measures, including vaccination, during the global pandemic in 2009 averted outbreaks of infl uenza A H1N1 at the Hajj and the Asian Youth Games, Singapore. 19, 20 The extent to which information needs at these mass gatherings are driven by politics and the media rather than by epidemiology or public health risk is not clear from published work. Demand is huge for information about any possible risk to the Games and to the reputation of the host city. Politicians and decision makers often seek reassurance that nothing is happening-this negative fi nding is not easily and reliably available from traditional surveillance systems. Recognition of the limits of surveillance systems needs to be part of massgathering planning.
 In the summer of 2012, London hosted the Olympic and Paralympic Games, respectively the largest and second largest international sporting mass gatherings in the world. The Olympics involved 10 500 competitors from 205 nations in 26 sports, and the Paralympics included 4200 competitors from 147 nations in 21 sports. More than 9 million tickets were sold for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and an estimated 11 million spectators attended across all venues. 21, 22 Authorities began public health planning more than 7 years before the Games, following the principles laid out in the WHO Communicable Disease Alert and Response for Mass Gatherings Guidelines, and the experiences of previous host cities. [23] [24] [25] Planners recognised that during mass gatherings such as the 2012 Games it is important to address public health issues with the utmost urgency. The systems and capacity need to be in place to rapidly receive and analyse information from surveillance, reporting, and intelligence systems, and to identify and respond to any potential healthprotection threat.
 The UK Health Protection Agency (HPA, now Public Health England [PHE] ), in partnership with other local, national, and international agencies such as WHO, local government authorities, and the UK Food Standards Agency, developed a public health risk assessment for the Games. This assessment informed the UK national crossgovernment Olympic risk assessment, which formed the basis for the UK Government's Olympic planning.
 The approach taken to the public health risk assessment was to follow the principles of risk analysis (what might happen?), surveillance and reporting (how will we know when it happens?), and response (what will we do if it happens?). In response to this risk assessment, systems were enhanced to provide additional surveillance data, improve understanding of the public health eff ect of the 2012 Games, and raise public awareness and understanding of public health concerns.
 The UK, like most developed countries, has well established public health surveillance based on clinician, environmental, and laboratory reporting, augmented in the UK by syndromic reporting systems. These systems are coordinated and managed across England by the PHE as the lead public health agency. Although the systems are very eff ective, the risk assessment for the Games suggested that they would not be suffi cient in terms of speed and comprehensiveness of coverage. Several enhancements to these systems were therefore imple mented as part of preparations for the 2012 Games, 26, 27 including the addition of data for attendance at Olympics venues to the core reporting requirement of notifi ed cases, and a move from weekly to daily analysis and reports. 27 The national Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control routinely collates reports of incidents, outbreaks, and adverse trends from across the UK; during the Games, in addition to undertaking this daily, they collated the enhanced systems we describe in this Series paper.
 Daily analyses of mortality data were also done, and a new system was introduced for sentinel intensive care units to report unexplained illness of probable infectious cause. 28 This system involved clinicians in paediatric and adult intensive care units rapidly reporting cases using a customised web-based method. Cases were defi ned as thought to be due to infections but for which initial laboratory tests did not establish a diagnosis and which did not fi t with a recognisable clinical picture, or those in which the patient was not responding to standard therapy.
 Before the Games, the HPA had two well established syndromic surveillance systems that had been used successfully during the Icelandic volcano and pandemic fl u incidents. [29] [30] [31] These systems were the HPA/NHS Direct Syndromic Surveillance System, which provides so-called pre-primary care data using call information from the health advice telephone service for a range of syndromes, and the HPA/QSurveillance National General Practitioner (GP) Surveillance System, one of the largest GP surveillance systems in Europe, which monitors weekly consultation data from a network of more than 3500 GP practices across the UK. Further GP surveillance was done with the long-term sentinel surveillance scheme coordinated by the Royal College of General Practitioner's Research and Surveillance Centre.
 The 2012 Games risk assessment results showed a gap in the surveillance, missing visitors who might attend an out-of-hours provider of primary care (GP services), or attend either a walk-in medical centre or an emergency department. This gap was important, because the NHS directed overseas visitors to these providers to reduce any eff ect on normal health services. The assessment results also underscored that data from all systems were needed on a daily basis in advance of and throughout the Games. [32] [33] [34] The establishment of these two new national syndromic surveillance systems-GP out-of-hours and emergency department-developed specifi cally for the Games are among the surveillance systems that will continue to operate in England as part of the Games' legacy. 35, 36 
 During the 2012 Games a national event-based surveillance team was the hub for reporting of incidents and outbreaks of an infectious disease from across the UK that might substantially aff ect the Games, by their eff ect on venues, Olympic staff , athletes, or visitors, or by the public's perception of the Games.
 The team enhanced established systems by reviewing and collating daily incident and response reports submitted by all local health-protection teams. The team also reviewed the national public health case-manage ment system (HPZone) for incidents and diseases of special interest. Information from both these sources was collated, and a Games-specifi c risk assess ment made according to agreed criteria. 37 Information about any notable events identifi ed was routinely reported daily to the national coordination centre, or more frequently, if needed.
 For the fi rst time syndromic surveillance reporting was undertaken at the Games polyclinic. 38 This polyclinic, in the Athletes' Village in the main Olympic-Paralympic park, was the principal point of access to medical services for athletes and others. Medical facilities 39 were also located in every sporting venue, as well as in one of the main hotels housing the Olympic-Paralympic family. Each time a medical service was used, the doctor, fi rst aider, physiotherapist, dentist, or other health-care provider recorded details of the consultation and treatment using a medical encounter form. These forms provided an electronic record of the signs and symptoms of the presenting illness or injury. The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) wanted to gain some understanding of the incidence and pattern of infectious disease during the Games time-for the fi rst time an additional section was included on the form to enable this. This section was obligatory for care providers to complete, and asked whether the encounter was fever, rash, diarrhoea or vomiting, respiratory symptoms, jaundice, meningitis or encephalitis, or none of these.
 The HPA worked with international partners-particularly the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and WHO-to set up enhanced international surveillance for the 2012 Games. 40, 41 This international surveillance monitored and assessed the risk, on a day-to-day basis throughout the surveillance period, of any infectious disease threats abroad that had the potential to aff ect health in the UK, and, in particular, at the Games. The team undertook joint risk assessments of incidents identifi ed as relevant through an agreed set of criteria designed for the Games, using methods developed for this purpose.
 The HPA's Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards provided a daily environmental hazards situation report based on the gathering and analysis of data for both chemical and radiological incidents, along with any necessary expert public health advice. This report also included a range of environmental quality indicators including air quality, temperature, ultraviolet radiation levels, and pollen levels, as well as information on risks from river and surface-water fl ooding. 42
 Enhanced clinical, public health, and environmental microbiology laboratory capability and capacity are necessary to meet the increased demands of a mass gathering. As well as additional routine testing requirements, response teams need the ability to rapidly scale up the testing capability as part of the response to an infectious-disease outbreak. The recognised lower threshold for potential public health incidents needs provision of rapid, accurate diagnoses and expert advice, as well as provision of surge capacity. Before the 2012 Games, several innovations in laboratory surveillance, introduced by the HPA's Microbiological Services Division, also began operation. [43] [44] [45] The risk assessment for the Games identifi ed likely communicable disease threats, including gastrointestinal, respiratory, waterborne, and vaccine-preventable diseases. As a result, enhanced front-line microbiology services (and, in the case of gastrointestinal pathogens, a more rapid diagnostic assay) were established.
 Laboratory testing of water, food, and environmental samples in and around Games venues was an important element of the work. This testing would provide early warnings of exposures to infectious or toxic hazards, ensure satisfactory standards of food and water for consumption were achieved, and guarantee environ mental controls (particularly of water in new or vacant buildings and facilities) were properly applied. Additional tests are often requested by event organisers-eg, for the 2012 Games additional tests were done on samples from marinas, hotels, training camps, and ships, as well as on samples from swimming pools, spa pools, water systems, food services, and mobile food vendors. An additional request was to assess the water quality of the architectural water features in the Olympic Park.
 During the Games-time, the HPA Olympics Coordinating Centre (OCC) produced the daily public health situation report, primarily for LOCOG and the Department of Health. Information provided in this report came from across the agency, Devolved Administrations (Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland), LOCOG, and organisations such as the Food Standards Agency. A process of assessment for inclusion in the reports submitted to the OCC was agreed, and then a further review to identify what would be included in the situation report. This report was attached to the overarching Department of Health summary of all health activities that went to the national government coordination system that was operational during the Games-time, and its key points were included in the daily Department of Health ministerial briefi ng.
 In the lead-up to the Games (June 2-27, 2012) several reports were received by the HPA of routine infections such as norovirus in several athletic teams (infections occurred before the teams arrived at the Athletes' Village), and of chickenpox among crew on a fl oating hotel for Games' staff . These outbreaks were managed by following of routine public health measures, such as isolation of people who were ill and provision of information about signs and symptoms of infections. The main risk was that of the athletes with norovirus transferring to the Athletes' Village (a closed community) while infectious-action was therefore taken by LOCOG, on the HPA's advice, to delay and manage the transfer of athletes. Figure 1 shows the number of events reported in HPA's daily situation report, by primary source of report. Across the 73 days of the HPA's daily Games-time monitoring (July 2-Sept 12), the HPA's situation report included 58 new events (not including the routine daily environment information from the Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards), and 95 updates on these events. In total, the OCC received reports on 158 events that were assessed by the OCC director and relevant experts to establish relevance to the Games. The table shows the events reported in the daily situation reports.
 The events reported were those that met the criteria for inclusion: ""any event in the UK or internationally related to either an infectious or non-infectious agent aff ecting an individual or a group of individuals, which could have put the health of those participating, visiting or working at the Olympics at signifi cant risk; or which was likely to Table: HPA's daily situation reports and updates of events be/had been the subject of media scrutiny which would harm the perception of the Games; or which may have resulted in widespread public concern, which needed to be addressed"". 37 Figure 2 shows the types of events reported in the daily HPA situation report. Most incidents were those routinely seen during summer and, as expected, related mainly to gastroenteritis (possible food poisoning) and vaccinepreventable diseases. [46] [47] [48] These incidents posed no risk to the Games and were managed through standard public health measures. However, some events reported were associated with athletes, and the HPA managed these appropriately by the provision of expert advice and close working with LOCOG. As noted, unusual events were reported if they attracted media attention even if they were not directly related to the Games-hence the reporting of a case of anthrax, which was in an intravenous drug user and not connected to the Games.
 Nothing unusual was reported, but the speed with which the HPA was informed, the response undertaken, and information shared across partners was far quicker than normal, and showed the thirst for information during Games time. Rumour management took up substantial time; rumours were predicted and managed well by provision of accurate, timely information, in addition to the assurance provided to politicians, the media, and the public through the daily reporting.
 Sporadic cases of gastrointestinal illness were expected and occurred. Not all gastrointestinal illnesses are foodrelated, even if people often attribute illness to a recent meal, and identifi cation of a cause or source of infection is not always possible. The numbers and patterns of illnesses recorded during the 2012 Games were not unusual, and were similar to those of other similar mass gatherings. No common food source linked to failures in food-safety management controls was identifi ed; however, despite substantial planning, slight confusion remained around the investigation of food-related incidents and who was responsible for this inside venues. Some of this confusion might have been caused by the involvement of various organisations nationally, and of new organisations such as LOCOG, instead of the standard investigation and response being undertaken by local authorities and health-protection teams. This level of involvement was driven by the political sensitivity of the Games and potential reputational issues.
 The syndromic surveillance done through the polyclinic did not detect any outbreak that could have been important for the Games. The data received enabled the HPA to feel assured that no outbreak of illness occurred that needed investigation or control measures instigated. The data were reported daily in the OCC situation report. Figure 3 shows an example of reported respiratory symptoms data by category of person.
 Because the London 2012 Games was the fi rst time this reporting was undertaken, no background data were available for the usual numbers of illness or syndromes expected in the population accessing the polyclinic. If the background data had been available, interpretation of the reported numbers of people with each syndrome, by comparison with expected numbers, would have been easier. Additionally, many teams brought their own doctors from their countries, who saw athletes and offi cials outside the polyclinic; some cases would therefore not have been reported through the system.
 No major public health incidents occurred during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Only a few outbreaks of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections were recorded during the period. These outbreaks were not a risk to the Games, and overall infectious disease reports were at rates typical for mass gatherings and unexceptional for an average UK summer. No food-borne illness was directly linked to a Games venue, despite the tendency for those reporting them to label them as such.
 However, to what extent additional food-safety measures put in place for the Games contributed to the low incidence of illnesses is not possible to say.
 To state this confi dently, the HPA introduced a number of enhancements to the surveillance and reporting systems, many of which have now been incorporated as routine systems within the UK. Also, close collaboration Gastrointestinal (various) (19) Malaria (1) Air quality (ozone) (2) Fire (1) International events (5) Anthrax (1) Meningitis (1) Chicken pox (4) Respiratory (legionella) (2) and robust planning across all relevant stakeholders were key factors in ensuring that all potential issues were identifi ed and that any links to the Games could be reliably ascertained. Some vaccine-preventable diseases needed more sensitive consideration to balance the competing interests of prevention of spread in a confi ned community against the desire of elite athletes to not be treated invasively while training and performing. This need shows the importance of real-time information and rapid public health risk assessment that takes into account the context of the incident.
 Provision of reassurance to the organising committee (and government and media) that nothing was happening proved to be a very important role of the public health surveillance systems. The importance of this reassurance role is not well described in mass-gathering publications and was not recognised in the initial stages of planning for the 2012 Games. Because the need for this reassurance emerged in the planning discussions, enhancements to surveillance systems and to the coordination and communication of public health activity were necessary to ensure the need could be met. Surveillance systems are not primarily designed to prove that nothing is happening, so they need to be reviewed and enhanced to fulfi l this role eff ectively. Organisers planning mass gatherings in the future should consider this aspect of surveillance requirements as part of their assessment of the existing system's capacity.
 To access information from as many sources as possible-eg, through media communications systems-is also important. Information sometimes appeared very quickly in the public domain through social media outlets such as Twitter. These reports were quickly addressed with the enhanced surveillance and reporting systems to assess validity. Robust communication arrangements also ensured rapid dissemination of information to stakeholders, professionals, the media, and the public, and prevented the escalation of rumours. This system of active coordination of information through a single point of contact also allowed us to establish, more accurately than previously, whether events occurring during the Games had a genuine relationship to the Games or were coincidental-something that has not always been possible at mass gatherings.
 In conclusion, many of the enhanced surveillance and reporting systems and ways of working have now been embedded, and are a direct legacy of the Games; the public health service in the UK has been enhanced. This enhancement will enable improved national security through better surveillance capacity and cross-sector working, and a coherent approach to public health security issues across national government and globally. It is now important to maintain and build on this enhance ment. Our key message is that, although the absolute risk of health-protection problems, including infectious diseases, at sporting mass gatherings is low, the need for reassurance of the absence of problems is higher than has previously been considered, and this could challenge conventional public health surveillance systems. Lessons from this experience of the London 2012 Games are being used by those planning for the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. 49, 50 ",265d4ef0216be4043c6760f232290970568438c2,2014-06-20,"McCloskey, Brian; Endericks, Tina; Catchpole, Mike; Zambon, Maria; McLauchlin, Jim; Shetty, Nandini; Manuel, Rohini; Turbitt, Deborah; Smith, Gillian; Crook, Paul; Severi, Ettore; Jones, Jane; Ibbotson, Sue; Marshall, Roberta; Smallwood, Catherine A H; Isla, Nicolas; Memish, Ziad A; Al-Rabeeah, Abdullah A; Barbeschi, Maurizio; Heymann, David L; Zumla, Alimuddin",The Lancet,10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62342-9,The Lancet,700.0,True,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the etiologic agent of varicella (chickenpox) and zoster (shingles). Acute infection with VZV is followed by cell-associated viremia and the rash of varicella (Arvin, 2001) . The virus is thought to spread within the body by cell-to-cell transfer of virus. Mannose 6-phosphate inhibits infection with cell-free VZV, which implicates the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR ci ) in facilitating entry of cell-free virus by interacting with viral glycoproteins that contain phosphorylated N-linked complex oligosaccharides (Gabel et al., HSV glycoprotein D (gD) has been identified as the viral ligand for each of these receptors. Although a cellular receptor for gE/gI has been postulated, it has not yet been identified. VZV encodes at least seven glycoproteins, gB, gC, gE, gH, gI, gK, gL, all of which have well-conserved homologs in HSV (Cohen and Straus, 2001) . HSV gE or HSV gD alone do not mediate membrane fusion. Inhibition of IDE results in reduced VZV infectivity and cell-to-cell spread. These experiments identify IDE as a VZV receptor and confirm the essential role that gE plays in VZV infection. The Extracellular Domain of gE Interacts with IDE VZV gE is essential for virus replication and may be important for virus entry. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie blue. The band was excised, and sequencing identified the protein as IDE. To confirm the interaction of gE with IDE and rule out the possibility of binding to the Fc tag, pull-down assays were performed using truncated gE without an Fc tag (gEt) immobilized onto protein A-Sepharose beads with monoclonal antibody to gE and incubated with lysates from HeLa cells or human T cells. gB and gH play important roles in viral entry and/or infectivity of herpesviruses. 1988) , with a small amount present on the cell-surface plasma membrane (Seta and Roth, 1997; Yaso et al., A protein of 120 kDa was present on the surface of HeLa and melanoma cells (Figure 2A, lanes 1 and 2) . Polyclonal antibody ( Figure S4 ) blocked VZV infection in a dose-dependent manner. HA-IDE binds to gEt significantly greater than to gIt or gBt. Error bars show standard deviations, and t test was used to determine p values. Soluble IDE inhibited infectivity by 70%, while control protein had no effect ( Figure 3D ). Two days later the cells were stained with X-gal. Interestingly, VZV infectivity was enhanced when the virus was pretreated with recombinant soluble IDE (rIDE) produced in a baculovirus expression system ( Figure 3F ). Since rIDE is produced in insect cells, it may be processed differently than IDE extracted from liver. At 2.5 days after transfection, half of the cells were harvested for immunoblotting to determine the level of IDE, and the remainder of the cells was infected with cell-free ROka-lacZ. IDE-specific siRNA knocked down the IDE level by about 95% compared with control siRNAs, as calculated by densitometry ( Figure 4A ). Interestingly, most of the X-gal positive foci in the cells transfected with IDE-specific siRNA consisted of only single isolated blue cells ( Figure 4C , panels 3 and 4); in contrast, larger foci involving multiple cells, due to cell-to-cell spread of virus, were (B) Monolayers of CV-1/EBNA-1 cells were biotinylated for 30 min at room temperature in PBS to label cell-surface proteins. Lane 9 represents lysate not incubated with beads. Bacitracin inhibited gEt-IDE complex formation in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5A ). Bacitracin also inhibited the interaction of IDE with gE-Fc fusion protein (G.L. and J.C., unpublished data). Plaque size in the presence of 1 mg/ml of bacitracin, added either at the time of infection or 8 hr after infection to allow virus entry, was reduced, indicating that the drug also reduced cell-to-cell spread of VZV. Three days postinfection, GFP-positive foci were counted. The experiment was repeated with similar results. infectivity at the doses used (data not shown). To ensure that the effects of bacitracin on VZV entry and cell-to-cell spread were not due to an effect on virus replication, we performed electron microscopy on VZV ROkainfected cells in the presence or absence of bacitracin. The cells were then incubated for an additional 20 hr. These data indicate that bacitracin did not inhibit VZV replication or trafficking to the cell surface. The figure represents the results of two independent experiments. Since CHO and mouse melanoma cells do not support productive infection, the ability of human IDE to increase the number of GFP-positive cells after incubation with VZV suggests that the IDE is important for a very early step in virus infection. A 3-fold increase in GFP expression was also seen when porcine cells (SK-6 A7), which do not support productive VZV infection, cotransfected with the GFP reporter plasmid, and plasmid expressing human IDE or empty vector were used in place of CHO and CHO B3 cells in the assay described above (unpublished data). Cells were fixed and plaques stained with anti-gE antibody. P values were calculated using a t test. ( Counts per minute (CPM) were obtained by subtracting those from lysates of uninfected cells from virus-infected cells. We cotransfected CHO cells with specific siRNA to knockdown endogenous CHO IDE and infected the cells with cell-free ROka-GFP 2 days later. Cotransfection of CHO cells with IDE-specific siRNA and a control plasmid resulted in reduced levels of endogenous IDE compared with cotransfection of the cells with control siRNA and control plasmid (Figure 7 , lanes 4 versus 1). Thus, the level of VZV infectivity generally correlated with the level of IDE expression. Here we show that VZV uses IDE as a receptor for infection with cell-free virus and cell-to-cell spread of virus. While VZV gE coprecipitated with IDE, HSV gE interacted with IDE much more weakly than its VZV homolog. In addition, while bacitracin blocked IDE and inhibited VZV infection and cell-to-cell spread, the antibiotic did not reduce HSV infection or cell-to-cell spread. Although HSV is closely related to VZV and has many homologous genes, our data suggest that HSV does not use IDE as a receptor. 1997; Misbin and Almira, 1989; Muller et al., It has been hypothesized that these IDE ligands possess common conformational motifs for binding to IDE (Kurochkin, 1998) . This suggests that IDE may have a role in VZV infection of neurons. HSV has recently been shown to enter certain cells by endocytosis in a pH-dependent pathway (Nicola et al., Many viruses have evolved to use multiple receptors to augment their infectivity. It is likely that VZV uses another molecule, in addition to IDE, to bind to cells. Investigations are currently underway to identify other cellular molecules that are important for VZV binding and infection. 2000) , B78H1 mouse melanoma cells (from N.

The gathering of a large number of pilgrims could compromise the health system of the host country. The threat to global health security posed by infectious diseases with epidemic potential shows the importance of advanced planning of public health surveillance and response at these religious events. Saudi Arabia has extensive experience of providing health care at mass gatherings acquired through decades of managing millions of pilgrims at the Hajj. In this report, we describe the extensive public health planning, surveillance systems used to monitor public health risks, and health services provided and accessed during Hajj 2012 and Hajj 2013 that together attracted more than 5 million pilgrims from 184 countries. We also describe the recent","Religious events and festivals can be attended by large numbers of pilgrims from within and outside the host country, geographic region, or continent. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] One of the major public health concerns in relation to mass gatherings is the importation or exportation of infectious diseases, and spread between attendees and to the local population. [6] [7] [8] [9] The gathering of huge numbers of pilgrims can compromise the health system of the host countries. [10] [11] [12] [13] Additionally, the threat to global health security posed by infectious diseases that might be exported to the pilgrims' home country shows the importance of advance planning, global communication, public health surveillance, and response at religious mass gatherings. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] The Hajj or pilgrimage to Makkah, Saudi Arabia, is one of the largest yearly religious mass gatherings worldwide, with more than 2 million people from more than 184 countries. 1, 2 Hajj is one of the obligatory fi ve pillars of Islam-a duty that all physically healthy, ablebodied adult Muslims must undertake once in their lifetimes if they can aff ord it, 1,2 and is undertaken over 5 days during Dhul Hijjah 8-12, the 12th month of the Islamic calendar (fi gure 1). The proximity between pilgrims due to the crowded accommodation, congregation, and prayers creates an ideal environment for transmission of infectious diseases, many of which are preventable if appropriate measures are taken. In this report, we describe the extensive public health planning and surveillance systems that were used to monitor public health risks, and provision of and access to health services during Hajj 2012 and Hajj 2013, which together attracted more than 5 million pilgrims from 184 countries.
 Every year more than 10 million pilgrims from 184 countries arrive at Makkah for the Hajj or the Umrah. The Umrah is also a pilgrimage to Makkah, but of shorter duration than the Hajj and can be made at any time of the year. The busiest period for the Umrah is during Ramadan, the month of fasting, which is about 3 months before the Hajj. Although during the Hajj, pilgrims visit the holy cities Makkah and Medina, Saudi Arabia, the strict defi nition of Hajj only applies to the pilgrimage to Makkah. The lunar calendar is 10 days or 11 days shorter than the Gregorian version used in the west. Thus, the Hajj moves forward by 10 days or 11 days every year according to the Gregorian calendar.
 The number of pilgrims undertaking the Hajj has increased from 58 584 in 1920 to 3 161 573 in 2012 (1 752 932 from outside Saudi Arabia). Because of the continued expansion of the Grand Mosque, which surrounds the Ka'aba in Makkah, to accommodate the increasing numbers of pilgrims, the Saudi Government issued permits to pilgrims for Hajj 2013. These permits led to reductions in the number of pilgrims from Saudi Arabia and other countries (fi gure 2). Thus, for Hajj 2013, 1 343 995 international pilgrims visited Saudi

 Arabia through the 16 ports of entry (94% through the two airports at Jeddah and Medina, 5% through the 11 land ports, and 1% through the three sea ports).
 The Saudi Government has a well established system for the planning, communication, security, health, safety, and administrative issues in relation to the Hajj. To minimise the health risks to the pilgrims, the Saudi Ministry of Health liaises with governments of all countries from which pilgrims visit Makkah and Medina throughout the year. The public health measures for Hajj are focused on provision of safe water and food supplies, sanitation, vector control, pre-travel health regulations and advice about vaccinations, health checks, and specifi c immunisation at the port of entry, health education campaigns, and provision of free health care to pilgrims through several clinics and hospitals. A proactive public health programme is initiated before each Hajj, with focus on prevention and surveillance of health hazards, and health-care provision during the pilgrimage. Before each Hajj, the Saudi Ministry of Health disseminates the health requirements for issuance of travel visas, and provides advice about public health guidelines to prevent the spread of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] This advice is re-enforced with widespread health education and prevention campaigns through reading materials, travel agents, pilgrims' group leaders, and media communication during the Hajj.
 The Hajj poses enormous logistical and planning challenges for the protection of the health of pilgrims [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] and Saudi residents and for the maintenance of national and global health security. The Saudi Government's success in alert and response planning for infectious diseases is attributable to a multidisciplinary group of experts from various government sectors who are involved in the advance planning of health services, logistical support, and communications for the Hajj. Continuous monitoring of emerging infectious diseases ensures that, for example, infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in an individual 28 is not transmitted to other pilgrims, thereby avoiding a worldwide epidemic. The Saudi Government coordinates the Hajj activities through a supreme committee and 24 subcommittees for the Hajj. 16, 19 For Hajj 2012 and Hajj 2013, the three key planning For the Hajj, pilgrims wear simple garments (white for male pilgrims), do prayers, and undertake a series of rituals and rites together as an expression of unity, equality, and solidarity irrespective of nationality, ethnic origin, sex, and social class. Pilgrims fulfi l each of the required prayer rituals by visiting and doing prayers in a particular order at several of the holy sites in Makkah, commencing at the Ka'aba. Although most pilgrims walk during the Hajj, some may use transport (eg, bus or trains) and those who have a disability or are elderly are pushed along in wheelchairs or carried on the shoulders of other pilgrims.
 More than 2 million pilgrims arrive in Saudi Arabia through various ports of entry
 Pilgrims circumperambulate the Ka'aba (Tawaf) seven times, while reciting prayers, and then briskly walk between the hills of Safa and Marwah seven times (Sa'i). Afterwards, the pilgrims proceed to Mina.
 Pilgrims return to Makkah for the final Tawaf (seven times) and Sa'i (seven times)
 Pilgrims do five daily prayers, starting with Fajr (morning prayer) and ending with Isha (evening prayer), and spend most of their time reading the Quran. Pilgrims then make their way to Mount Arafat.
 On return to Mina, at the start of Eid-al-Adha festival, pilgrims participate in the Jamarat ceremony. An animal sacrifice is made and the meat is distributed to people who are poor. Men shave off the hair on their heads before doing prayers for Eid al-Adha.
 Pilgrims devote their time to prayer from sunrise to dusk, while living in tents. They leave for Muzdalifah after sunset.
 Pilgrims gather pebbles for the Jamarat ceremony in which pebbles are thrown at three stone pillars (symbolic of the devil). Before the sun rises, the pilgrims set off on their return to Mina.
 considerations by the Saudi Government for communicable disease alert and response during the pilgrimage, based on WHO's recommendations for communicable disease alert and response during mass gatherings, 29 were risk assessment of what might happen during the Hajj, proactive surveillance for communicable diseases especially because of outbreaks of MERS-CoV and other viral diseases, and response and action. Additionally, input about outbreak management and emerging diseases is provided by WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, UK's Public Health England, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through the Saudi Public Health Directorate of the Ministry of Health. Thus, a major global eff ort is needed to maintain the highest level of public health services and increased risk awareness of infectious diseases during the Hajj.
 Early preparations for Hajj are undertaken by the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Ministry of Health. 19 Like other years, planning for Hajj 2012 and Hajj 2013 began soon after the end of the previous Hajj with a wide range of feedback in relation to the application of the previous year's public health programme. Additionally, information from monitoring and evaluation of the prevalence and emergence of infectious diseases globally, regionally, and locally is taken into account to develop the public health programme for alert and response for the next Hajj. The planning and management team consists of several multidisciplinary committees (security authorities, civil defence, education authorities, mosques, Saudi Red Crescent Authority, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques Institute of the Hajj Research at Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, and the municipality of Makkah). The response team continuously assesses the global, regional, and local infectious disease patterns and has plans in place for quarantine of any imported threats of infectious diseases.
 The Ministry of Health and Ministry of Hajj provide regular updates about Hajj travel advice and health regulations for pilgrims and these are posted on the Ministry of Health's website. They also disseminate this advice through liaising closely with international public health agencies including WHO, Public Health England, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and many religious groups, organisations, and travel agencies that provide Hajj and Umrah services. Regular bulletins also draw attention to any new threats of disease to pilgrims.
 During any mass gathering, including the Hajj, gastrointestinal infections are a major health hazard. Continuous surveillance of the threat of food poisoning and spread of several viral, bacterial, and protozoal pathogens is done routinely as part of the public health response for the Hajj. Many factors can have a role in causing gastrointestinal infections, including inadequate standards of food preparation, poor personal hygiene, contaminated water supply, the presence of asymptomatic carriers of pathogenic bacteria and parasites, and the large numbers of meals prepared and poorly stored by pilgrims. Public health measures at the Hajj are focused on provision of safe water and food supplies, sanitation, and vector control. A committee for the security control of main water sources in Makkah and the other holy sites does thorough inspections of the quality of drinking water. A daily inspection tour of water treatment plants is done to ensure that the chlorine pumping equipments function properly. Inspections of all main water supply sources and water tanks at various locations including schools, government departments, houses, mosques, hotels, and food stores in Makkah and the other holy sites are done throughout the year.
 A committee for the removal of treated sewage water liaises with the Ministry of Health to ensure the safety of produce from irrigated vegetable farms. A thorough survey is done of kitchen workers at hotels and hospitals to identify potential carriers of gut pathogens and to ensure standards of food hygiene are maintained. All kitchens and samples of food and water are inspected to ensure compliance with the health regulations. Additionally, swabs from utensils and throats and nails of the people working in the kitchens are tested for the presence of pathogens. As a precaution, the Ministry of Health strongly enforces the regulation that pilgrims are not allowed to bring fresh food or agricultural products into Saudi Arabia. arboviruses and malaria, 30 thus necessitating a widespread vector control programme that includes a routine and widespread insecticide spraying campaign. For the Hajj, this programme is intensifi ed and the Ministry of Health liaises closely with the Ministry of Public Health and Ministry of Agriculture in Makkah to coordinate and assess pest control, identify the zones and density of mosquitoes, and undertake insecticide spraying campaigns. Specifi c teams spray housing units earmarked for pilgrims who come from dengueendemic areas such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh with longlasting pesticide before the arrival of the pilgrims. The teams also spray government departments, and all fi eld accommodation used by pilgrims such as tents at the holy sites with a longlasting pesticide. Also, insecticide is sprayed aerially over Arafat and Mina. In accordance with the international health regulations, all aircraft and ship carriers are required to provide an offi cial valid carrier sanitation certifi cate to verify that insecticide spraying was done before arrival at the port.
 The diverse cultural, ethnic, and language diff erences of the pilgrims are taken into consideration in the educational and health awareness campaigns for the prevention of communicable diseases during Hajj. 
 To keep the health risks to pilgrims to a minimum and to prevent importation or acquisition of communicable diseases during travel (panel), the Ministry of Health issues its own health regulations, [22] [23] [24] [25] which are updated every year. Before an entry visa for Hajj or Umrah can be issued, pilgrims are required to meet both sets of health regulations. The requirements for Hajj 2012 and Hajj 2013 included vaccinations against yellow fever, meningitis, and polio. All travellers arriving from countries in Africa, South America, and Central America must present a valid vaccination certifi cate for yellow fever at the border. Individuals without such a certifi cate will be off ered the vaccine and then observed for 10 days. All aircraft, ships, and other vehicles arriving from countries with a prevalence of yellow fever are required to have a valid certifi cate indicating that disinsection has been done according to WHO's recommendations to eradicate all insect vectors of disease. For Hajj 2013, compliance with vaccination against yellow fever for pilgrims from countries at risk was more than 99%. 19 To reduce the risk of invasive meningococcal disease, experts from 11 countries in the Middle East recommended vaccination with the quadrivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccine (ACYW135). 31, 32 Adults and children (aged >2 years) are given one dose of the quadrivalent polysaccharide ACYW135 vaccine. Pilgrims arriving from countries in the African meningitis beltnamely, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Eritrea, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sudan-in addition to the vaccination, are given ciprofl oxacin tablets at the port of entry to reduce the prevalence of carriers of Neisseria meningitidis. Quadrivalent vaccination is given to pilgrims from within Saudi Arabia, residents of Makkah and Medina and Saudi Government staff who work during the Hajj.
 For immunisation against polio, all pilgrims younger than 15 years who travel from countries where polio is reported to be prevalent are expected to be vaccinated against the infection. 24,25 Irrespective of previous immunisation, a single dose of the polio vaccine is administered to pilgrims on arrival to Saudi Arabia from countries where polio has been reported. The number of pilgrims vaccinated against polio at port of entry is about 500 000. 5 For Hajj 2013, 430 490 doses of polio vaccine were administered at ports of entry to 99% of eligible pilgrims. 19 For seasonal infl uenza, the Saudi Ministry of Health recommends vaccination, particularly for people at increased risk of severe infl uenza-ie, pregnant women, children younger than 5 years, elderly people, and individuals who are immunosuppressed or have HIV/AIDS, asthma, or chronic heart or lung diseases. Seasonal infl uenza vaccination is recommended for pilgrims from within Saudi Arabia, particularly those who have the risk factors described above, and all Saudi health-care workers in Makkah and Medina.
 For MERS-CoV, the Saudi Ministry of Health introduced recommendations 28 for Hajj 2013 based on the clinical, epidemiological, and scientifi c data 33-35 that were generated by the Saudi Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine. According to current recommendations that are reviewed yearly, because of the high mortality rates associated with MERS-CoV infection, people with the following risk factors should postpone Hajj or Umrah for their own safety: individuals who are older than 65 years of age; individuals who have chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, respiratory disease, autoimmune disease, or immune defi ciency (congenital and acquired); people who are taking immunosuppressive drugs; individuals who have a malignant disease or a terminal illness; pregnant women; and children younger than 12 years. Furthermore, the Saudi Ministry of Health also advises all pilgrims to comply with the common public health guidelines to prevent the spread of respiratory infections.
 The Saudi Ministry of Health closely monitors pilgrims' compliance with the international health regulations at all ports of entry-sea, land, and air. The largest numbers of pilgrims arrive through fi ve main ports including King Abdulaziz Airport in Jeddah, Prince Mohammad Airport in Medina, and Hallat Ammar ground crossing in Tabouk. The immunisation status of each pilgrim is checked and, if relevant, appropriate vaccines and antibiotics are administered in clinical examination rooms and holding areas at the main hubs of the international airport terminals for the Hajj.
 During Hajj, Saudi Arabia provides free medical care to all pilgrims in 25 hospitals with 5000 beds, including 500 beds for critical care. All communicable diseases of importance at mass gatherings are monitored-eg, respiratory tract infections, food poisoning, diarrhoeal diseases, invasive meningococcal disease, viral haemorrhagic fevers (dengue, Alkhurma, Marburg, Crimean Congo, Ebola, and Lassa), yellow fever, polio, and plague. The Command and Control Centre in Makkah uses the latest electronic health surveillance systems for rapid communication, and effi ciently initiates appropriate responses during Hajj. The web-based health-care surveillance network (fi gure 3) is used by the Command and Control Centre and is organised into eight main components: investigations, outbreak management, immunisation, family health, notifi cations, work management, inventory, and national health safety network.

All end-user surveillance stations gather and send data to the Hajj operation team at the Command and Control Centre through the major local area networks that connect all end-user stations with both wired and wireless connections to the centre. These end-user stations are hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah. The information technology system gathers data, does the statistical analysis, and displays and transfers the results to the Command and Control Centre. These results are displayed on the video wall and interactive board. A digital pen was used in 2012 to convert the conventional paper-based system into a digital system for provision of demographic and medical data. Thus, the entire demographic and health data for each case can be captured and relayed rapidly. Information technology is also used by the ambulance information system to record data about medical and administrative procedures done by ambulance staff on patients. The data are transferred swiftly to the hospital emergency departments before the arrival of patients.
 Several outbreaks of infectious diseases have been recorded at the Hajj. The fi rst such recorded outbreak was in 632 AD, when malaria was originally called yethrib fever. 36 A realisation of the adverse implications of the threat of malaria to public health at the Hajj focused the attention of the Saudi Government on enforcing the regional malaria eradication programme. 30 A wide range of viral and bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract can occur during the Hajj. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] Bacterial and viral pneumonia are common causes of hospital admission in pilgrims. 39, 40, 43, 44 Factors that contribute to the spread of these pathogens include proximity between pilgrims, shared accommodation, and dust in the environment. Transmission of tuberculosis during Hajj is diffi cult to ascertain because of the long incubation. 41, 47 The risk of tuberculosis during the Hajj is estimated to be about 10% based on data from before and after screening visits for latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 48 Most pilgrims come from areas that are highly endemic for tuberculosis 49 and many travel to Makkah with active disease or infection that is reactivated by stress. Pulmonary tuberculosis was a leading cause of hospital admission in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Strategies to reduce the transmission of tuberculosis during the Hajj and development of an evidence base for appropriate intervention measures remains one of the priorities for the Saudi Ministry of Health.
 Over the past decade, the emergence of several new coronaviruses and infl uenza viruses such as infl uenza A H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and MERS-CoV have been a concern for the Saudi Ministry of Health. However, no major outbreaks have occurred at the Hajj as shown by the results of a cohort study of French pilgrims in 2012. 50 In 2009, fewer than 100 cases of infl uenza A H1N1 were reported during Hajj at the peak of the pandemic, and only 26 confi rmed cases during Umrah. 51 In another study, no infl uenza A H1N1 infection was detected in 559 pilgrims. 52 The results of this study, however, showed rapid infection with respiratory viruses and bacteria, particularly rhinovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The Saudi Ministry of Health is assessing vaccines for prevention of pneumococcal infections. 53 The ministry is also in the process of defi ning the exact burden of pneumococcal sepsis (pneumonia, meningitis, or invasive disease) during Hajj. 53 Pneumococcal vaccines (polyvalent), specifi cally for people older than 65 years and those with splenectomy, are available. Additionally, other forms of prevention are widely available and are known to reduce the burden of disease associated with S pneumoniae. Although the eff ectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination for the prevention of S pneumoniae infections in elderly pilgrims is yet to be ascertained, these individuals might benefi t from vaccination with the polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine for the common pneumococcal serotypes that are circulating during Hajj.
 In September, 2012, MERS-CoV was fi rst identifi ed as a new virus that causes fatal respiratory disease after identifi cation of a novel β coronavirus from a patient in I  II  III  IV  V   0   50 100 Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, who died from a severe respiratory illness. 54 By the end of March, 2013, 6 months after MERS-CoV was discovered, only 17 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported globally 55 -including, nine from Saudi Arabia and four from one family case-cluster. 56 Alarmist media reports after the detection of cases of MERS-CoV infection in the UK, 57 France, 58 Germany, 59 and Italy 60 
 The crowded conditions at the Hajj increase the risk of transmission of N meningitidis and the development of invasive meningococcal disease. Two major outbreaks of Hajj-related meningococcal disease have been reported in Saudi Arabia. 61, 62 In 1987, during the outbreak of N meningitidis serogroup A, the incidence of infection was 640 cases per 100 000 pilgrims. 61 Three interventions were implemented by the Saudi Ministry of Health after the outbreaks: introduction of compulsory vaccination with bivalent A + C vaccine for all pilgrims (national or international), yearly vaccination campaigns for all people living near the pilgrimage sites, and compulsory administration of oral ciprofl oxacin to pilgrims from countries in the sub-Saharan Africa meningitis belt to minimise nasopharyngeal carriage. In 1992, although an increasing number of cases of N meningitidis serogroup A infection were detected, there was no epidemic. 62 During Hajj 2000 and Hajj 2001, 400 cases of a hypervirulent strain of W135 N meningitidis infection were reported in returning pilgrims and their contacts. 63, 64 The Saudi Ministry of Health responded by recommending the polysaccharide quadrivalent ACYW meningococcal vaccine for children older than 2 years and adults living in Makkah and Medina, children older than 2 years accompanying their parents on Hajj from within and outside of Saudi Arabia, health-care workers in Saudi Arabia, and government personnel serving the pilgrims.
 Since 2006, only one case of invasive meningococcal disease has been reported in Medina during Hajj. 63 After the introduction of the ACYW vaccine in 2002, the incidence of this disease in Saudi Arabia fell over the years (fi gure 4). Concerns that mass immunisation with vaccines that do not protect against all serogroups could lead to an increase in the incidence of meningococcal disease caused by N meningitidis strains that are not included in the vaccine have not been substantiated. The Saudi surveillance data for invasive meningococcal disease showed a reduction in the number of Hajj-related cases and non-Hajj-related cases after the introduction of the ACYW vaccine in 2002. 63 Continued surveillance with yearly analysis of data is necessary to bring about the adaptation of public health measures and avoid future epidemics of invasive meningococcal disease during the Hajj in subsequent years. Data from Hajj 2011 and Hajj 2012 are very encouraging and no further cases have been reported of invasive meningococcal disease.
 Outbreaks of gastroenteritis due to food poisoning with Salmonella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, or Clostridium perfringens toxin are common at all religious festivals, including the Hajj. 65, 66 Although no major foodborne outbreaks resulting in high mortality rates have been associated with the Hajj, gastroenteritis symptoms were reported in an Iranian group of pilgrims, 67 but the cause and source have not been ascertained. There are few reports of the incidence and cause of diarrhoea during the Hajj although diarrhoea is a common cause of hospital admission. 40, 44, 68 As the global cholera pandemic continues, [68] [69] [70] and outbreaks in countries where pilgrims come from are frequent, cholera is under constant surveillance by the Saudi Command and Control Centre. All cases of diarrhoea and people living in the same camps as the cases are quarantined and their contacts are traced. Because pilgrims on arrival might be incubating the infectious cause of diarrhoea, the focus of public health surveillance is on proactive surveillance, early diagnosis, treatment, and contact tracing and quarantine.
 A decade ago, cases of malaria reported in pilgrims in Makkah were thought to be a reactivation of the disease in people from malaria-endemic countries or a consequence of Saudi-endemic transmission. 30 
 The Hajj attracts increasing numbers of pilgrims every year. As the events in relation to the recent MERS-CoV outbreak show, the Hajj will continue to pose substantial public health challenges for health authorities in Saudi Arabia, the countries from where pilgrims travel, and worldwide. The introduction and spread of infectious diseases during and after the Hajj or any mass gathering event will remain important topics on the public health agendas for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the Hajj off ers a great opportunity for creating a health legacy that will enable improvements in health systems and services for mass gatherings. It presents major opportunities to do high-quality cross-sectional, case-control, and longitudinal cohort studies to generate an evidence base for the development of optimum recommendations for prevention, management, and control of infectious diseases and for sustaining global health security for Hajj 71 and other mass gatherings. The Saudi Ministry of Health established the Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine in 2012 with the headquarters in Riyadh. This centre is a virtual research network of UK academic and public health institutions in partnership with the WHO Collaborating Centre on Mass Gatherings Medicine and WHO Global Capacity Alert and Response. This unique network will undertake longitudinal and cross-sectional cohort studies, review and publish reports, and has brought together a coalition of interested partners to gather and translate an appropriate evidence base into public health policy for use by countries that host mass gatherings. So far, the Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine has established an overarching board chaired by the Saudi Minister of Health with membership of experts from the University College London, Public Health England, WHO, Saudi Council for Health Specialties, and the Saudi national research funding agency King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology. The Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine has held two scientifi c advisory committee meetings and an international conference. The centre has already embarked on achieving its mandates by undertaking research into the MERS-CoV outbreak, tuberculosis, and HIV in Saudi Arabia. [33] [34] [35] [72] [73] [74] [75] The centre's fi rst group of ten Saudi physicians has embarked on a diploma programme for mass gatherings medicine approved by the Saudi Council for Health Specialties. The current focus of research is on MERS-CoV and other respiratory viral infections and best strategies to prevent them. Through provision of a scientifi c evidence base the Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine aims to drive the best health promotion, prevention guidelines and practice, and health education for attendees at the Hajj and other mass gatherings.
 The spread of infectious diseases at a gathering of large numbers of pilgrims within a short space of time might be expected to compromise the health system of the host country. Additionally, infectious diseases pose a threat to global health security and show the importance of planning, communication, and public health surveillance and response at these religious events. Saudi Arabia has much experience of providing health care during religious mass gatherings through decades of managing millions of pilgrims who undertake Hajj. The formation of the Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine and its network will serve as a unique platform for providing a research evidence base and for sharing knowledge about the safeguarding and improvement of the health of attendees at mass gatherings.

By the time Zika virus was discovered in May of 2015 (Zanluca et al., By mid-2017, reports from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) (PAHO, 2017a (PAHO, , 2017b revealed Zika virus activity throughout the Americas was waning, prompting predictions for the end of the epidemic (e.g., O'Reilly et al., 2016) , primarily PAHO (PAHO, 2017a (PAHO, , 2017b . 2018) , accurate local reporting is especially problematic. Infectious disease surveillance of international travelers (''travel surveillance'') has been an effective method for detecting pathogens circulating in resource-limited areas (Hamer et al., 2018) , we hypothesized that, by creating a framework integrating local case reporting and travel surveillance with genomic epidemiology, we would be able to uncover potentially still-ongoing Zika outbreaks. In this study, we combined travel surveillance, local case reporting, and clinical sequencing of Zika virus from infected travelers to detect virus outbreaks that had previously been missed. We discovered a large Zika outbreak in Cuba that was not reported to PAHO (PAHO, 2017c) or other public health agencies and thus went undetected to the international community. Overall, our study creates a combined framework for how travel surveillance and genomic epidemiology can be used as a future surveillance network for detecting hidden outbreaks of worldwide emerging infections and reconstructing transmission dynamics when local reporting is absent, withheld, or otherwise insufficient. Our data demonstrate that the vast majority of Zika cases during 2017 were the result of an unreported Zika outbreak in Cuba, which occurred while public data suggested the epidemic was nearing its end in the Americas (PAHO, 2017a, 2017b; Figure 1 ). We obtained monthly suspected and confirmed Zika cases locally reported by individual countries and territories from PAHO. We found that the last local case from the Caribbean was also reported in August 2017. The vertical lines represent the months the last local and travel cases were reported per region and the month that the World Health Organization (WHO) Public Health Emergency of International Concern status was lifted for the Zika epidemic (November 2017). In each region, travel cases and local cases were correlated (Pearson r range = 0.542-0.976; each comparison can be found in Data S1). ( The data used for this figure can be found in Data S1. To further confirm the timing of a Zika outbreak in Cuba, we obtained global travel surveillance data from the US CDC GeoSentinel Surveillance Network (Hamer et al., We used the mean posterior estimates of the proportion of local to travel incidence from 23 countries throughout the Americas ( Figure S4 ), each individually multiplied by the mean posterior estimates of the Cuba travel incidence rate ( Figure S5 ). Our analyses show that the Zika outbreak in Cuba was delayed by approximately a year compared to those elsewhere in the Caribbean (Figure 1 ). We created phylogenetic trees using time-resolved Bayesian inference ( Figure 4A ; Data S3) and maximum likelihood reconstruction ( Figure S6 ; Data S3). (A) The local Zika virus incidence rates for each country and territory were calculated by the number of locally reported cases per month per 100,000 population. This local incidence rate was then used to estimate local per capita incidence rates and subsequent number of Zika cases per month in Cuba. (C) The estimated number of Zika cases from Cuba (mean from B) and the total reported number of Zika cases during 2016 to 2017 from all countries and territories in the Americas with Zika virus transmission were plotted with the human population size from each region. aegypti mosquitoes in Cuba that later gave rise to human cases. By comparing our tMRCA estimates from Cuba to those of other Caribbean islands, we found that the establishment of the virus in Cuba was itself delayed by a year (third quarter 2016 versus mid-2015; Figure 4C ). We then compared our tMRCAs to epi curves created from our travel surveillance and found that the peak of the 2017 Zika outbreak in Cuba occurred 11-13 months after the virus became locally established, which was in agreement to what we found for the 2016 Zika outbreaks in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean as a whole (excluding Cuba; Figure 4C ). aegypti surveillance and control campaigns (Castell-Florit Serrate and Má s-Bermejo, Castro et al., aegypti-borne viruses, including Zika virus, require opportunities for virus introductions and conducive conditions to support establishing transmission. 2014) , we analyzed air travel patterns to determine whether Cuba had fewer opportunities for virus introductions early during the Zika epidemic, potentially delaying the outbreak ( Figure 5A ). To explore this scenario, we examined Caribbean outbreaks of another Ae. aegypti-borne virus, dengue virus, using travel Figure S6 . ( surveillance that we performed based on data reported by the FL-DOH. This was despite other Caribbean islands having both dengue and Zika virus transmission in 2016 ( Figures 3A and 5B ). aegypti-borne virus outbreaks in 2016; however, they do not reveal the underlying cause.

We previously demonstrated that mosquito control campaigns can reduce Ae. aegypti populations and human Zika virus infections .

We found that immediately following the reported implementation of mosquito control in February 2016, our travel surveillance showed minimal transmission of both dengue and Zika viruses throughout the year (Figures 5B and 5C ). Indeed, four local Zika cases were reported in Florida during 2017, linked to their partners having recently returned from Cuba (FL DOH, 2017a , 2017b . Critically, they rely on accurate case reporting from individual countries and territories, but depending on resources and priorities, reporting of local outbreaks may not be accurate. The utility of combining travel surveillance with genomic epidemiology, however, is limited to the travel patterns and destinations of the people included in the surveillance network. 2014a) by assuming that locals and travelers were equally likely to get infected. As we previously showed that cruise ship traffic greatly outnumbered airline traffic during the 2016 Zika outbreak in Florida , we also investigated cruise ships to Cuba; however, we found their travel volume to be much smaller than airlines for this country ( Figure S3 ). Second, our size estimates are based on averaging across all regions, some of which may be more, or less, representative of the Zika outbreak in Cuba. Although the factors supporting virus maintenance are still unclear, it is plausible that Zika virus may survive low mosquito abundance through a combination of low-level mosquito-to-human transmission, vertical transmission in mosquitoes (da Costa et al., 2016) , and, to a lesser extent, human sexual transmission (Althaus and Low, 2016) . This strategy was built upon years of effective dengue control through capacity building and research (Guzmá n, 2005; Guzmá n and Kourí, 2009). Competition between dengue and Zika viruses-as previous exposure to dengue virus may protect against Zika virus infections in humans (Gordon et al., For future studies, accurate data on Zika virus seroprevalence in Cuba and other Caribbean islands would be helpful to address these questions. aegypti populations were reduced during the control campaign in Cuba, as we previously observed in Florida .

For each, we used the fda (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fda/index.html) package in R to model per capita local incidence of Zika over time with univariate cubic B-spline functions with four knots per year for two years (2016) (2017) described by parameters q. We assumed that incidence among travelers from each country followed the same temporal pattern as local incidence but the two differed in magnitude by a factor m, which could be due to differences in exposure or healthseeking behavior between international travelers and the general population. Based on this likelihood formulation and with non-informative priors, we estimated q and m for each country using a Metropolis-Hastings implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). To estimate per capita local incidence in Cuba, we first estimated q for Cuba in a similar manner, but based on travel data only.

We aimed to investigate the epidemiology of MERS-CoV outbreak in our hospital.
 We identifi ed all patients and health-care workers who had been in the emergency room with the index case between May 27 and May 29, 2015. Patients were categorised on the basis of their exposure in the emergency room: in the same zone as the index case (group A), in diff erent zones except for overlap at the registration area or the radiology suite (group B), and in diff erent zones (group C). We documented cases of MERS-CoV infection, confi rmed by real-time PCR testing of sputum samples. We analysed attack rates, incubation periods of the virus, and risk factors for transmission.
 After excluding nine cases (because of inability to determine the date of symptom onset in six cases and lack of data from three visitors), the median incubation period was 7 days (range 2-17, IQR 5-10). The median incubation period was signifi cantly shorter in group A than in group C (5 days [IQR 4-8] vs 11 days [6-12]; p<0·0001). There were no confi rmed cases in patients and visitors who visited the emergency room on May 29 and who were exposed only to potentially contaminated environment without direct contact with the index case. The main risk factor for transmission of MERS-CoV was the location of exposure.
 Interpretation Our results showed increased transmission potential of MERS-CoV from a single patient in an overcrowded emergency room and provide compelling evidence that health-care facilities worldwide need to be prepared for emerging infectious diseases.","Since the fi rst identifi cation of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in 2012, 1 most patients infected with the virus have been exposed in the Middle East. As of March 23, 2016, 1698 laboratoryconfi rmed cases have been reported to WHO. 2 On the basis of previous epidemiological fi ndings, 3 the potential of MERS-CoV to spread to large numbers of people has been considered low, by contrast with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The basic reproductive number of MERS-CoV was estimated to be less than 1·0, suggesting low transmissibility. 4, 5 However, a 2013 outbreak of MERS-CoV infection in Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia, where one patient infected seven other patients in dialysis and intensive care units, 6 raised concerns about potential so-called super-spreaders 7 that were reported during the SARS epidemic. 8, 9 From May to July, 2015, a large outbreak of MERS-CoV infection occurred in South Korea from a traveller returning from the Middle East, which led to 186 confi rmed cases (Patient 1 to Patient 186) in the country. 10 Patient 1 was diagnosed at our hospital (Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea) after transmitting the virus at several health-care facilities before he came to our hospital. Patient 14 was exposed to Patient 1 outside the hospital and sought additional care at our hospital without knowing he was infected with MERS-CoV. Therefore, we experienced both South Korea's fi rst MERS-CoV case and the case of highest transmission of MERS-CoV following a single patient exposure in an emergency room. We aimed to investigate the epidemiology of MERS-CoV infection in a crowded emergency room outside of the Middle East and the presence of multiple super-spreaders.
 In May, 2015, two patients with MERS-CoV infection (Patient 1 and Patient 14) sought care in our emergency room at the Samsung Medical Center without knowing they were infected with MERS-CoV. While these patients were in the emergency room, a large number of patients, visitors, and health-care workers were exposed during both events.
 When MERS-CoV infection was suspected in Patient 1 and Patient 14, contact investigation was immediately initiated. Since no one developed MERS among contacts who were exposed to Patient 1, only contacts of Patient 14 are reported here. We identifi ed, from electronic medical record review and security video footage, all patients who had been in the emergency room with Patient 14 as contacts, regardless of the location and duration of exposure. We categorised patient contacts into three groups on the basis of their maximum exposure: patients who were in the same zone in the emergency room (group A; considered close contacts), those who were in diff erent zones but had time overlap with Patient 14 in the registration area or radiology suite (30 min before and 2 h after; group B), and those who were in diff erent zones (group C). Patients who were admitted to hospital for treatment of their primary illness after exposure in the emergency room were quarantined in private rooms for 14 days from the last exposure or discharged home after treatment was fi nished and continued isolation at home. Patients and their family members who were already discharged home were reached by telephone, informed about possible MERS-CoV exposure, and provided with hotline numbers for any inquiries.
 Health-care workers who were exposed were identifi ed through interviews and review of employees' duty schedules, electronic signature on medical records of Patient 14 and patient contacts, security video footage, and self-report. Health-care workers who provided direct care to Patient 14 were initially considered close contacts and were placed into quarantine at home for 14 days from the last day of exposure. Other health-care workers who worked in the emergency room during the same time period continued to work with monitoring and were removed immediately from duty if symptoms developed.
 A confi rmed case was defi ned as a person with laboratory confi rmation of MERS-CoV infection from sputum samples, initially by real-time RT-PCR testing with amplifi cation targeting the upstream E region (upE) and then confi rmed by subsequent amplifi cation of open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) using PowerChek MERS realtime PCR kits (Kogene Biotech, Seoul, Korea). Patients' demographic information, underlying disease, dates of emergency room visit, duration of stay with exact arrival and departure times, and location within the emergency room were collected. If radiographic examinations were done, the time of examination was collected. For healthcare workers, age, sex, occupation, history of patient assignments and working or visiting zone, and dates and time of duty or emergency room visits were collected. The attack rate was calculated by dividing the number of confi rmed cases by the total number of exposed individuals in the emergency room in each group. Because the total list of visitors was unavailable, we estimated the number of visitors who were in the emergency room by assuming that one patient had at least one visitor during their stay; we also simulated the scenarios of two and four visitors per patient. To avoid underestimation, we chose the assumption of one visitor per patient, which would give the highest attack rate among the scenarios. The incubation period was defi ned as the time of fi rst exposure to the onset of clinical symptoms of MERS-CoV infections.
 Categorical variables were presented with frequency (percentage) and continuous variables were summarised with median (range, IQR). We calculated overall comparison of attack rates across the groups with χ² test and across zones with Fisher's exact test. Incubation
 Evidence before this study Little information on nosocomial outbreaks caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outside the Middle East had been available before the large MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea in 2015, for which global alert was issued. We searched PubMed for reports published in English from May 1, 2015, to Dec 31, 2015, using the terms ""MERS-CoV"" and ""Korea"". We identifi ed 38 reports, none of which provided detailed description for the contact investigation of massive transmission of MERS-CoV from a super-spreader in an overcrowded emergency room setting.
 To our knowledge, this study is the fi rst to categorise exposed patients into groups according to the type of exposure and to document group-specifi c incubation periods and attack rates.
 Furthermore, this study provides detailed epidemiological data, including a fl oor plan of the emergency room, to understand how MERS-CoV spread by a single super-spreader through several modes of transmission.
 Results from our contact investigation showed increased transmission potential of MERS-CoV from a single spreader, as has been documented in the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. The potential for similar outbreaks anywhere in the world should be noted, as long as MERS-CoV transmission continues in the Middle East. Our study provides evidence that hospitals, laboratories, and governmental agencies should be prepared for MERS-CoV infection. period and exposure time were compared among groups with Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Tukey's test using ranks for multiple comparisons. To assess the risk factors for MERS-CoV infection among all patient contacts, we did a multiple logistic regression analysis based on likelihood ratio, by regressing on age, sex, underlying disease, and groups. In a subgroup analysis of patients in group A, the length of stay in the same zone and location were included. For these analyses, odds ratios and 95% CIs were reported. p values and 95% CIs were adjusted with Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons if necessary. Two-sided p values of less than 0·05 were considered signifi cant. We used SAS version 9.4 and GraphPad Prism version 6.04 for statistical analyses.
 Samsung Medical Center is a modern 1982-bed university-affi liated tertiary hospital providing referral care in South Korea (total population roughly 50 million), with roughly 9000 staff , including more than 1400 physicians and 2600 nurses.
 The emergency room entrance is located on the ground fl oor near the south gate of the main hospital building. More than 200 patients are seen in the emergency room each day; the average duration of stay in the emergency room was 15 h before the MERS-CoV outbreak (see appendix p 2 for details on emergency room overcrowding index). The emergency room has seven patient care areas, including zones I to IV for 
 See Online for appendix adults, a trauma zone, a resuscitation room, and a paediatric zone (fi gure 1). The paediatric zone and zone IV are separated from the rest of the main areas. Two negative-pressure rooms are located in the paediatric zone and two are in zone IV. The emergency room has its own radiology suite for emergency room patients only. The sizes of each zone were as follows: zone I 121·7 m², zone II 64·2 m², zone III 168·3 m², and zone IV 223·9 m². Zones I and II included seating areas (50 chairs in zone I and 26 chairs in zone II), where stable patients received treatment and waited for test results. Seriously ill patients, who required close observation and needed a designated bed, were moved to zone III (17 beds) or zone IV (23 beds). Zone IV was used for patients being admitted. Beds in zones III and IV were spaced roughly 1·8 m apart, with curtains in between. Nurses were assigned to work in designated zones, whereas physicians and transfer agents took care of patients in several zones. All zones in the emergency room were covered by the same air handling units.
 There was no funding source for this study. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had fi nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Upon arrival at our emergency room, he denied having travel history to the Middle East and any possible exposure to people infected with MERS-CoV. He was treated for possible bacterial pneumonia on the basis of partial improvement from previous antibiotic treatment and increased C-reactive protein concentration of 13·0 mg/dL (normal <0·3 mg/dL; appendix p 4). During his stay in the emergency room, he was provided with a mask but frequently could not hold it because of severe respiratory symptoms. He was not isolated in a separate room; a negative-pressure room was not considered at that time. As his dyspnoea aggravated on May 28, supplemental oxygen was administered at 2 L per min via a nasal cannula (up to 5 L per min). However, no aerosol-producing procedures, including nebuliser treatments, were given. On the night of May 29, he received a notifi cation call from the health authorities about possible exposure to Patient 1, notifi ed our hospital, and was immediately transferred from the emergency room to isolation in a negativepressure isolation room. MERS-CoV infection was confi rmed on May 30, and he was transferred to the nationally designated health-care facility. From May 27 to May 29, he stayed in three zones in our emergency room: zone II for roughly 10 h on May 27, zone III for 19 h from May 27 to May 28, and zone IV for 25 h from May 28 to May 29 (fi gure 1). Additionally, from May 27 to May 29, he went to the radiology suites four times. On May 27, he walked around and outside the emergency room and went to the toilet several times because of diarrhoea.
 Between May 27 and May 29, 2015, the average ventilation rate in the emergency room was maintained at three air changes per h, taking 2 h to remove airborne contaminant with a 99·9% effi ciency. 11 The median temperature was 23·8°C (range 14·4-32·2), and the median relative humidity was 32·9% (range 27·1-36·8).
 675 patients (117 in group A, 58 in group B, and 500 in group C), an estimated 683 visitors, and 218 health-care workers were identifi ed as contacts of Patient 14 (table 1). We assumed that each patient had one visitor and added eight extra visitors (fi ve to group A and three to group C) The epidemic curve of this emergency room-associated outbreak is shown in fi gure 2. The incubation period was determined from 73 confi rmed MERS-CoV cases: six cases were excluded because we could not determine the date of symptom onset, and data were not available from three visitors. The median incubation period was 7 days (range 2-17, IQR 5-10). Among 59 patients and visitors in groups A-C (excluding six who were not initially identifi ed as contacts), the median incubation period was signifi cantly shorter in group A than in group C (fi gure 2).
 Excluding three patients with confi rmed MERS-CoV infection who were not identifi ed in the initial patient contact investigation (appendix p 5), the overall attack rate for patients in the emergency room was 4% (30 of 675). Patients in group A had the highest attack rate (20% [23 of 117]), compared with 5% (three of 58) in group B and 1% (four of 500) in group C (fi gure 3). After adjusting for age, sex, underlying disease, and groups, patients in group A had the highest risk for MERS-CoV infection (table 2). In group B, all three patients who had MERS-CoV infection had time overlap in the radiology suite with Patient 14.
 The median exposure time for patients in group A to Patient 14 was 3·0 h in zone II (range 0·5-10·3, IQR 1·9-4·5), 13·9 h in zone III (0·6-18·9, 6·3-18·4), and 17·4 h in zone IV (0·2-23·2, 9·2-21·4). The attack rates were 23% (13 of 57) in zone II, 32% (seven of 22) in zone III, and 8% (three of 38) in zone IV (fi gure 3). After adjusting for age, sex, underlying disease, and exposure time, staying in zone II was associated with a signifi cantly higher risk for MERS-CoV infection than staying in zone IV (table 2) . MERS-CoV transmission occurred in zone III, despite the fact that the distance from Patient 14's bed to the beds of other patients were as far as 6 m (fi gure 4). In zone IV, Patient 14 moved from bed 12 to bed 23, and six additional cases were documented in patients and visitors occupying beds in the middle of this zone, which were not adjacent to Patient 14's bed. No MERS-CoV infection was reported in patients and visitors who had been in the emergency room on May 29 during the time period when they were exposed only to zones II (n=81) or III (n=15), while Patient 14 was confi ned to zone IV. These patients were exposed to areas that were potentially environmentally contaminated but not to Patient 14 himself (fi gure 4). Under the assumption of one visitor per patient and excluding three visitors with confi rmed MERS-CoV infection who were not identifi ed in the initial visitor contact investigation (appendix p 5), the overall attack rate for visitors was 6% (38 of 683).

 Error bars represent 95% CI. MERS-CoV=Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The attack rates for patients and visitors were 20% (47 of 239) in group A, 5% (six of 116) in group B, and 2% (15 of 1003) in group C. Under the assumptions of two visitors per patient and four visitors per patient, the overall attack rates for visitors were 3% and 1%, respectively. 218 health-care worker contacts were identifi ed, and fi ve (2%) developed MERS-CoV infection. Three healthcare workers who were not initially identifi ed as contacts (one security guard, one physician, and one patient transfer agent) developed MERS-CoV infection. Although they were not involved in the direct care for Patient 14, they visited the emergency room between May 27 and May 29. Only close contacts were furloughed and other health-care workers were isolated when they developed symptoms. There were no secondary cases from health-care workers among contacts during the their duty hours.
 We did a contact investigation of the MERS outbreak at the Samsung Medical Center by grouping exposed individuals on the basis of the extent of exposure to Patients 1 and 14. To our knowledge, we are the fi rst to document group-specifi c incubation periods and attack rates. Our results showed the increased transmission potential of MERS-CoV from a single patient in an overcrowded emergency room setting. Overcrowding is an important issue for this outbreak and is also a common feature of modern medicine.
 This study is unique because the index exposure occurred in a large emergency room in a tertiary-care centre, with electronic medical record information available to track the location and duration of exposure, thus enabling near-complete tracing of exposed contacts. The classic defi nitions of close contact as being within roughly 6 feet (1·8 m) or within the same room or care area for a prolonged period of time were diffi cult to apply to an emergency room setting with high patient volumes, ongoing traffi c within the emergency room and to and from the radiology suite, and large numbers of visitors and family members. We considered all patients who visited the emergency room during the stay of Patients 1 and 14 as exposed contacts, developed criteria for close contacts by expanding on the defi nitions of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 12 and categorised patients into diff erent groups. Therefore, we could establish group-specifi c viral incubation periods and attack rates during the outbreak. In close contacts who stayed in the same zone, the incubation period was shorter and attack rate was higher than patients who stayed in diff erent zones. Additionally, in zones III and IV, patients were infected even when they were separated by curtains most of the time and were apart as far as 6 m (for beds on either side of the nurse's station; fi gure 4). Similar to the SARS outbreak, we observed so-called superspreaders among patients with MERS-CoV infection, and these super-spreaders can cause large outbreaks through several modes of transmission similar to those in the SARS outbreak. 13 Among patients who stayed in various locations, those who overlapped with Patient 14 at the radiology suite or registration area had higher attack rates (5%) than the rest of the patients (1%), suggesting that transmission might occur by even brief exposures to recently contaminated objects or encounters with individuals carrying a super-spreader.
 Comparisons of environmental exposure and patient exposure also revealed unique fi ndings. No patient developed MERS-CoV infection after exposure on May 29 only to the environment that had been potentially contaminated on May 27 (zone II) and May 28 (zone III) while Patient 14 was confi ned to zone IV on May 29. It is plausible that even if the environment was heavily contaminated by a super-spreader, the virus might not persist long enough in the environment to be capable of causing any new infection. Although patient exposure is clearly the most important factor in the spread of MERS-CoV, more research is needed to address the potential of environmental spread. 14 Increased viral load and larger amounts of respiratory secretions have been suggested as the factors for SARS-CoV super-spreaders. 15, 16 In this MERS outbreak, frequent ambulation of the index case could be considered as one factor related to high levels of viral transmission, in addition to large amounts of respiratory secretions and high viral load (cycle thresholds 18·6 for upE and 19·3 for ORF1a from Patient 1's sputum, 17 and 16·2 for upE and 19·9 for ORF1a from Patient 14's sputum). Of note, Patient 1 infected 28 patients in another hospital but caused no confi rmed secondary cases in our hospital, whereas Patient 14 caused an additional 82 cases in our hospital. The diff erence of transmissibility between these two individuals could be caused by a combination of factors such as the time from onset of disease, clinical symptoms, duration of contact exposure, pattern of behaviour inside and near the emergency room, and kinetics of viral shedding.
 We showed that obtaining a travel history from patients is an important element of history taking by all physicians, and not only those specialising in infectious diseases or those working in infection control. Suspicion for unusual infections should be maintained if patients do not or cannot report accurate histories. Readiness of laboratory support is essential for initial investigation and for control of outbreaks, and overly rigorous requirements for laboratory testing have the potential to delay diagnosis and further spread disease. Hospital leadership needs to lead in preparedness for disaster management of high-risk communicable infectious diseases. Emergency preparedness at a national level and communication and support from government agencies are imperative to prevent and control any serious outbreak.
 The results of this study need to be interpreted with caution because the study was not suffi ciently powered to study risk factors for transmission. Some of our data were collected retrospectively. Analysis on visitors was limited because we did not have detailed data. Serological tests were not done simultaneously and attack rates were calculated on the basis of results from real-time RT-PCR of mainly symptomatic individuals. The potential transmission of MERS-CoV by asymptomatic carriers is under investigation.
 In conclusion, we report a large nosocomial MERS outbreak that occurred outside the Middle East. The potential for similar outbreaks anywhere in the world from a single traveller should be noted, as long as MERS-CoV transmission continues in the Middle East. Emergency preparedness and vigilance are crucial to the prevention of further large outbreaks in the future. Our report serves as an international alarm that preparedness in hospitals, laboratories, and governmental agencies is the key not only for MERS-CoV infections but also for other new emerging infectious diseases.

During the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, infectious diseases accounted for less than 1% of health-care visits. 3 Data for the Attica region in Greece (in which Athens is located) during the Athens 2004 Games showed that, of the health problems for which people visited a primary-care physician, the most common were respiratory infections (6•7%) and gastroenteritis (3•7%) . 5 Enhancement of health-protection measures, particularly food safety and hygiene along the entire food-supply chain, might have caused an absolute decrease in morbidity. Several gastrointestinal incidents have been reported from mass gatherings such as festivals and sports events. [ 13 Infl uenza has frequently been recorded at sporting and music events such as the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, UT, USA, 14 and music festivals in 2009 in Belgium, 15 Serbia, 16 and Hungary, 17 and also at the World Youth Day in Sydney, NSW, Australia, in July, 2008. 19, 20 The extent to which information needs at these mass gatherings are driven by politics and the media rather than by epidemiology or public health risk is not clear from published work. Politicians and decision makers often seek reassurance that nothing is happening-this negative fi nding is not easily and reliably available from traditional surveillance systems. Recognition of the limits of surveillance systems needs to be part of massgathering planning. and response (what will we do if it happens?). In response to this risk assessment, systems were enhanced to provide additional surveillance data, improve understanding of the public health eff ect of the 2012 Games, and raise public awareness and understanding of public health concerns. These systems are coordinated and managed across England by the PHE as the lead public health agency. This gap was important, because the NHS directed overseas visitors to these providers to reduce any eff ect on normal health services. 35, 36 
 During the 2012 Games a national event-based surveillance team was the hub for reporting of incidents and outbreaks of an infectious disease from across the UK that might substantially aff ect the Games, by their eff ect on venues, Olympic staff , athletes, or visitors, or by the public's perception of the Games. Information from both these sources was collated, and a Games-specifi c risk assess ment made according to agreed criteria. 37 Information about any notable events identifi ed was routinely reported daily to the national coordination centre, or more frequently, if needed. 38 This polyclinic, in the Athletes' Village in the main Olympic-Paralympic park, was the principal point of access to medical services for athletes and others. Each time a medical service was used, the doctor, fi rst aider, physiotherapist, dentist, or other health-care provider recorded details of the consultation and treatment using a medical encounter form. This section was obligatory for care providers to complete, and asked whether the encounter was fever, rash, diarrhoea or vomiting, respiratory symptoms, jaundice, meningitis or encephalitis, or none of these. As a result, enhanced front-line microbiology services (and, in the case of gastrointestinal pathogens, a more rapid diagnostic assay) were established. Across the 73 days of the HPA's daily Games-time monitoring (July 2-Sept 12), the HPA's situation report included 58 new events (not including the routine daily environment information from the Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards), and 95 updates on these events. In total, the OCC received reports on 158 events that were assessed by the OCC director and relevant experts to establish relevance to the Games. The table shows the events reported in the daily situation reports. 46] [47] [48] These incidents posed no risk to the Games and were managed through standard public health measures. Sporadic cases of gastrointestinal illness were expected and occurred. The data were reported daily in the OCC situation report. Figure 3 shows an example of reported respiratory symptoms data by category of person. No major public health incidents occurred during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Surveillance systems are not primarily designed to prove that nothing is happening, so they need to be reviewed and enhanced to fulfi l this role eff ectively. To access information from as many sources as possible-eg, through media communications systems-is also important. These reports were quickly addressed with the enhanced surveillance and reporting systems to assess validity. In conclusion, many of the enhanced surveillance and reporting systems and ways of working have now been embedded, and are a direct legacy of the Games; the public health service in the UK has been enhanced. It is now important to maintain and build on this enhance ment. Lessons from this experience of the London 2012 Games are being used by those planning for the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games."

Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.
 Methods We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23-24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).
 In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47-2·86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304-130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8-7·1). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks.
 Interpretation Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.","The National Health Commission of China has developed a case-definition system to facilitate the classification of patients (panel). To mitigate the spread of the virus, the Chinese Government has pro gressively implemented metro politan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and several nearby cities since Jan 23-24, 2020. Numerous domestic See Online for appendix airports and train stations, as well as international airports, have adopted temperature screening measures to detect individuals with fever.
 Two other novel coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged as major global health threats since 2002, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; in 2002) that spread to 37 countries, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; in 2012) that spread to 27 countries. SARS-CoV caused more than 8000 infections and 800 deaths, and MERS-CoV infected 2494 individuals and caused 858 deaths worldwide to date. Both are zoonotic viruses and epidemiologically similar, except that SARS-CoV has virtually no subclinical manifestation, whereas MERS-CoV behaves more similarly to the other four commonly circulating human CoVs, with a substantial proportion of asymptomatic infections (table 1). Symptomatic cases of both viruses usually present with moderate-to-severe respiratory symptoms that often progress to severe pneumonia.
 A notable common characteristic of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is that they have low potential for sustained community transmission (ie, low basic reproductive number). 15, 28, 29 However, the most worrisome aspect is the ability of the viruses to cause unusually large case clusters via superspreading, which can exceed 100 individuals and are apparently seeded by a single index case. 5, [28] [29] [30] [31] In this study, we provide a nowcast of the probable size of the epidemic, recognising the challenge of complete ascertainment of a previously unknown pathogen with an unclear clinical spectrum and testing capacity, even after identification of the aetiological cause. More importantly, from a public health control viewpoint, we then forecast the probable course of spread domes tically and inter nationally, first by assuming similar transmissibility as the initial phase in Wuhan (ie, little or no mitigation interventions), then accounting for the potential impact of the various social and personal nonpharmaceutical interventions that have been progressively and quickly implemented in January, 2020.
 In this modelling study, we first inferred the basic reproductive number of 2019-nCoV and the outbreak size in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020, on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China. We then estimated the number of cases that had been exported from Wuhan to other cities in mainland China. Finally, we forecasted the spread of 2019-nCoV within and outside mainland China, accounting for the Greater Wuhan region quarantine implemented since Jan 23-24, 2020, and other public health interventions.
 Wuhan is the major air and train transportation hub of central China (figure 1). We estimated the daily number of outbound travellers from Wuhan by air, train, and road with data from three sources (see appendix p 1 for details):
 (1) the monthly number of global flight bookings to Wuhan for January and February, 2019, obtained from the Official Aviation Guide (OAG); (2) the daily number of domestic passengers by means of transportation recorded by the location-based services of the Tencent (Shenzhen, China) database from Wuhan to more than 300 prefecture-level
 Evidence before this study In central China, Wuhan is investigating an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the zoonotic 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Few data and details are currently available. Two other novel coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged as major global epidemics in recent decades; in 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spread to 37 countries and caused more than 8000 cases and almost 800 deaths, and in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spread to 27 countries, causing 2494 cases and 858 deaths worldwide to date. These CoVs are both zoonotic and have low potential for sustained community transmission. However, larger clusters involving superspreading events were observed for SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2014-17. As of Jan 25, 2020, the scale and geographical extent of the 2019-nCoV outbreak both within and outside mainland China are highly uncertain. National and global spread of this disease is particularly concerning given that chunyun, a 40-day period with extremely high air and train traffic across China because of the lunar new year Spring Festival, began on Jan 10, 2020. We searched PubMed and preprint archives for articles published up to Jan 25, 2020, that contained information about the Wuhan outbreak using the terms ""coronavirus"", ""CoV"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""Wuhan"", ""transmission"", ""China"", ""superspreading"", and ""Chinese New Year"". We found six studies that reported the relative risks of case exportation from Wuhan to areas outside mainland China.
 In the absence of a robust and complete line list for characterising the epidemiology of this novel pathogen, we inferred the outbreak size of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan from the number of confirmed cases that have been exported to cities outside mainland China. We used this outbreak size estimate to project the number of cases that have been exported to other Chinese cities. We forecasted the spread of 2019-nCoV both within and outside of mainland China. 32 On Jan 19, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that only 43 (22%) of the 198 confirmed cases in its outbreak investigation had been exposed to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, 33 the most probable index source of zoonotic 2019-nCoV infections, which was closed and disinfected on Jan 1, 2020. As such, and because of the difficulties of tracing all infections, we assumed that during Dec 1-31, 2019, the epidemic in Wuhan was seeded by a constant zoonotic force of infection that caused 86 cases (ie, twice the 43 confirmed cases with zoonotic exposure) in our baseline scenario. For the sensitivity analysis, we assumed 129 and 172 cases (50% and 100% higher than the baseline scenario value). Given that both 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV could cause self-sustaining human-tohuman transmission in the community, we assumed that the serial interval of 2019-nCoV was the same as that of SARS-CoV in Hong Kong (mean 8·4 days; table 1). 4 We assumed that the incubation period of 2019-nCoV was similar to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (mean 6 days; table 1). These assumptions are consistent with preliminary estimates of the serial interval (mean 7·5 days) and incubation period (mean 6·1 days) using line-list data from China CDC. 34
 We assumed that the catchment population size of the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport at Wuhan was 19 million (ie, Greater Wuhan region with 11 million people from Wuhan city plus 8 million from parts of several neighbouring cities). We estimated the number of cases in Greater Wuhan on the basis of the number of confirmed cases exported to cities outside mainland China whose symptom onset date had been reported to fall from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020 (appendix pp 2-4). The start date of this period (day D s ) corresponded to one mean incubation period before the Wuhan outbreak was announced on Dec 31, 2019, whereas the end date (day D e ) was 7 days before the time of writing (Jan 26, 2020). This end date was chosen to minimise the effect of lead time bias on case confirmation (the time between onset and case confirmation was ≤7 days in 46 [80%] of 55 cases exported to cities outside mainland China; see appendix pp 2-4). We let χ d to be the number of such case exportation on day d.
 Our 2019 OAG data indicated that for cities outside mainland China excluding Hong Kong, the daily average number of international outbound air passengers was L W,I =3633 and that of international inbound air passengers was L I,W =3546 in Greater Wuhan during January-Feb ru ary, 2019 (table 2) . We excluded Hong Kong in this estimate because travel from mainland China to Hong Kong had dropped sharply since August, 2019, because of social unrest in Hong Kong. Our calibrated Tencent mobility data indicated that for cities in mainland China, the daily number of all domestic outbound travellers was L W,C (t)=502 013 and that of all domestic inbound travellers was L C,W (t)=487 310 in Wuhan at time t before chunyun (Jan 10). During chunyun, these estimates were L W,C (t)=717 226 and L C,W (t)=810 500.
 We used the following susceptible-exposed-infectiousrecovered (SEIR) model to simulate the Wuhan epidemic since it was established in December, 2019:
 where S(t), E(t), I(t), and R(t) were the number of susceptible, latent, infectious, and removed individuals at time t; D E and D I were the mean latent (assumed to be the same as incubation) and infectious period (equal to the serial interval minus the mean latent period 4 ); R 0 was the basic reproductive number; z(t) was the zoonotic The case definition of 2019-nCoV differs depending on the context in which it is used.
 A suspected or probable case is defined as a case that meets: (1) three clinical criteria or (2) two clinical criteria and one epidemiological criterion. Clinical criteria are: fever; radiographic evidence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome; and low or normal white blood cell count or low lymphocyte count. Epidemiological criteria are: living in Wuhan or travel history to Wuhan within 14 days before symptom onset; contact with patients with fever and symptoms of respiratory infection within 14 days before symptom onset; and a link to any confirmed cases or clusters of suspected cases.
 The definition of a confirmed case, for the first case in a province, is a suspected or probable case with detection of viral nucleic acid at the city CDC and provincial CDC. For the second case and all subsequent cases, the definition is a suspected or probable case with detection of virus nucleic acid at the city CDC.
 We defined cases as individuals who were symptomatic, who could be detected by temperature screening at international borders, or who had a disease severity requiring hospital admission, or both, plus travel history to Wuhan.
 force of infection equal to 86 cases per day in the baseline scenario before market closure on Jan 1, 2020, and equal to 0 thereafter. The cumulative number of infections and cases that had occurred in Greater Wuhan up to time t was obtained from the SEIR model.
 We assumed that travel behaviour was not affected by disease and hence international case exportation occurred according to a non-homogeneous process with rate As such, the expected number of international case exportation on day d was Taken together, the likelihood function was
 We estimated R 0 using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Gibbs sampling and non-informative flat prior. For a given R 0 from the resulting posterior distribution, we used the same SEIR model to estimate the corresponding outbreak size in Wuhan and the probability distribution of the number of cases that had been exported domestically to other cities in mainland China (on the basis of the destination distribution in our calibrated Tencent mobility data). Point estimates were presented using posterior means, and statistical uncertainty was presented using 95% credible intervals (CrIs).
 We extended the above SEIR model into a SEIR-metapopulation model to simulate the spread of 2019-nCoV across mainland China, assuming the trans missibility of 2019-nCoV was similar across all cities. 35 The movements of individuals between more than 300 prefecture-level cities were modelled using the daily average traffic volumes in our calibrated Tencent mobility data. Given that 2019-nCoV has caused widespread outbreak awareness not only among public health professionals (ie, WHO and government health authorities), but also among the general public in China and other countries, the transmissibility of the epidemic might be reduced compared with its nascent stage at Wuhan because of community-wide social distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (eg, use of face masks and improved personal hygiene). Previous studies sug gested that non-pharmaceutical interventions might be able to reduce influenza transmission by up to 50%. 36 As such, we simulated local epidemics across mainland China assuming that the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV was reduced by 0%, 25%, and 50% after Wuhan was quarantined on Jan 23, 2020. The epidemics would fade out if transmissibility could be reduced by 1-1/R 0 . Further more, we considered 50% reduction in intercity mobility. Finally, we hypothesised that citywide population quarantine at Wuhan had negligible effect on the epidemic trajectories of the rest of the country and tested this hypothesis by making the extreme assumption that all inbound and outbound mobility at Wuhan were eliminated indefinitely on Jan 23, 2020.
 The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Figure 2 summarises our estimates of the basic reproductive number R 0 and the outbreak size of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that R 0 was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47-2·86) with an epidemic doubling time of 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8-7·1; figure 2 ). We estimated that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304-130 330) individuals had been infected in figure 3) . Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen were the mainland Chinese cities that together accounted for 53% of all outbound international air travel from China and 69% of international air travel outside Asia, whereas Chongqing is a large metropolis that has a population of 32 million and very high ground traffic volumes with Wuhan. Substantial epidemic take-off in these cities would thus contribute to the spread of 2019-nCoV within and outside mainland China.
 If the zoonotic force of infection that initiated the Wuhan epidemic was 50% and 100% higher than the baseline scenario value, then R 0 would be 2·53 (95% CrI 2·32-2·71) and 2·42 (2·22-2·60), respectively. The corresponding estimate of the number of infections in Wuhan would be 38% and 56% lower than baseline. The number of exported cases and infections in Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen would be similarly reduced in magnitude ( figure 3) . Figure 4 shows the epidemic curves for Wuhan, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen with a R 0 of 2·68, assuming 0%, 25%, or 50% decrease in transmissibility across all cities, together with 0% or 50% reduction in inter-city mobility after Wuhan was quarantined on Jan 23, 2020. The epidemics would fade out if transmissibility was reduced by more than 1-1/R 0 =63%. Our estimates suggested that a 50% reduction in inter-city mobility would have a negligible effect on epidemic dynamics. We estimated that if there was no reduction in trans missibility, the Wuhan epidemic would peak around April, 2020, and local epidemics across cities in mainland China would lag by 1-2 weeks. If transmissibility was reduced by 25% in all cities domestically, then both the growth rate and magnitude of local epidemics would be substantially reduced; the epidemic peak would be delayed by about 1 month and its magnitude reduced by about 50%. A 50% reduction in transmissibility would push the viral reproductive number to about 1·3, in which case the epidemic would grow slowly without peaking during the first half of 2020. However, our simulation suggested that wholesale quarantine of population movement in Greater Wuhan would have had a negligible effect on the forward

 Base case 50% higher zoonotic FOI 100% higher zoonotic FOI
 Estimates are as of Jan 25, 2020. Cases corresponded to infections that were symptomatic or infectious. The number of cases was smaller than the number of infections because some individuals with the infection were still in the incubation period. We assumed that infected individuals were not infectious during the incubation period (ie, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 37 ). PDF=probability density function. FOI=force of infection. Base case 50% higher zoonotic FOI 100% higher zoonotic FOI trajectories of the epidemic because multiple major Chinese cities had already been seeded with more than dozens of infections each (results not shown because they are visually indistinguishable from figure 4) . The probability that the chain of transmission initiated by an infected case would fade out without causing exponential epidemic growth decreases sharply as R 0 increases (eg, <0·2 when R 0 >2). 1, 38 As such, given the substantial volume of case importation from Wuhan (figure 3), local epidemics are probably already growing exponentially in multiple major Chinese cities. Given that Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen together accounted for more than 50% of all outbound interna tional air travel in mainland China, other countries would likely be at risk of experiencing 2019-nCoV epidemics during the first half of 2020.
 During the period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is established and reported case numbers are rising exponentially, nowcasting and forecasting are of crucial importance for public health planning and control domestically and internationally. 39, 40 In this study, we have estimated the outbreak size of 2019-nCoV thus far in Wuhan and the probable extent of disease spread to other cities domestically. Our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining human-to-human spread is already present in multiple major Chinese cities, many of which are global transport hubs with huge numbers of both inbound and outbound passengers (eg, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen).
 Therefore, in the absence of substantial public health interventions that are immediately applied, further international seeding and subsequent local establishment of epidemics might become inevitable. On the present trajectory, 2019-nCoV could be about to become a global epidemic in the absence of mitigation. Nevertheless, it might still be possible to secure containment of the spread of infection such that initial imported seeding cases or even early local transmission does not lead to a large epidemic in locations outside Wuhan. To possibly succeed, substantial, even draconian measures that limit population mobility should be seriously and immediately considered in affected areas, as should strategies to drastically reduce within-population contact rates through cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures, and instituting work-from-home arrange ments, for example.
 Precisely what and how much should be done is highly contextually specific and there is no one-size-fits-all set of prescriptive interventions that would be appropriate across all settings. Should containment fail and local transmission is established, mitigation measures according to plans that had been drawn up and executed during previous major outbreaks, such as those of SARS, MERS, or pandemic influenza, could serve as useful reference templates.
 The overriding epidemiological priority to inform public health control would be to compile and release a line list of suspected, possible, probable, and confirmed cases and close contacts that is updated daily and linked to clinical outcomes and laboratory test results. A robust line list is essential for the generation of accurate and precise epidemiological parameters as inputs into transmission models to inform situational awareness and optimising the responses to the epidemic. 41 Additionally, given the extent of spread and level of public concern it has already generated, the clinical spectrum and severity profile of 2019-nCoV infections needs rapid ascertainment by unbiased and reliable methods in unselected samples of cases, especially those with mild or subclinical presentations.
 The modelling techniques that we used in this study are very similar to those used by other researchers who are working towards the same goal of characterising the epidemic dynamics of 2019-nCoV (Zhanwei Du, University of Texas at Austin, personal communication). [42] [43] [44] [45] The consensus on our methodology provides some support for the validity of our nowcasts and forecasts. An additional strength of our study is that our model is parameterised with the latest mobility data from OAG and Tencent. Nonetheless, our study has several major limitations. First, we assumed that travel behaviour was not affected by disease status and that all infections eventually have symptoms (albeit possibly very mild). We would have underestimated the outbreak size in Greater Wuhan if individuals with increased risk of infection (eg, confounded by socioeconomic status) were less likely to travel internationally or if the proportion of asymptomatic infections were substantial. Second, our estimate of transmis sibility and outbreak size was somewhat sensitive to our assumption regarding the zoonotic mechanism that initiated the epidemic at Wuhan. However, our overall conclusion regarding the extent of case exportation in major Chinese cities would remain the same even for our lowest estimate of transmissibility ( figure 3) . Third, our epidemic forecast was based on inter-city mobility data from 2019 that might not necessarily reflect mobility patterns in 2020, especially in the presence of current public vigilance and response regarding the health threat posed by 2019-nCoV (appendix p 5). Fourth, little is known regarding the seasonality of coro navirus transmission. If 2019-nCoV, similar to influenza, has strong seasonality in its transmission, our epidemic forecast might not be reliable.
 Identifying and eliminating the zoonotic source remains an important task to prevent new animal-tohuman seeding events. The renewal of a complete ban on market trading and sale of wild game meat in China on Jan 26 can provide only temporary suspension of demand, even if completely adhered to. 46 Vaccine platforms should be accelerated for real-time deployment in the event of a second wave of infections. Above all, for health protection within China and internationally, especially those locations with the closest travel links with major Chinese ports, preparedness plans should be readied for deployment at short notice, including securing supply chains of pharmaceuticals, personal pro tective equipment, hospital supplies, and the necessary human resources to deal with the consequences of a global outbreak of this magnitude.

[ 1] [2] [3] [4] [5] One of the major public health concerns in relation to mass gatherings is the importation or exportation of infectious diseases, and spread between attendees and to the local population. [ 14] [15] [16] [17] [18] The Hajj or pilgrimage to Makkah, Saudi Arabia, is one of the largest yearly religious mass gatherings worldwide, with more than 2 million people from more than 184 countries. We reviewed studies cited in articles identifi ed in our searches and selected those that we identifi ed as relevant. Arabia through the 16 ports of entry (94% through the two airports at Jeddah and Medina, 5% through the 11 land ports, and 1% through the three sea ports). To minimise the health risks to the pilgrims, the Saudi Ministry of Health liaises with governments of all countries from which pilgrims visit Makkah and Medina throughout the year. Before each Hajj, the Saudi Ministry of Health disseminates the health requirements for issuance of travel visas, and provides advice about public health guidelines to prevent the spread of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. [ More than 2 million pilgrims arrive in Saudi Arabia through various ports of entry
 Pilgrims circumperambulate the Ka'aba (Tawaf) seven times, while reciting prayers, and then briskly walk between the hills of Safa and Marwah seven times (Sa'i). Afterwards, the pilgrims proceed to Mina. Pilgrims then make their way to Mount Arafat. On return to Mina, at the start of Eid-al-Adha festival, pilgrims participate in the Jamarat ceremony. An animal sacrifice is made and the meat is distributed to people who are poor. Pilgrims devote their time to prayer from sunrise to dusk, while living in tents. Pilgrims gather pebbles for the Jamarat ceremony in which pebbles are thrown at three stone pillars (symbolic of the devil). considerations by the Saudi Government for communicable disease alert and response during the pilgrimage, based on WHO's recommendations for communicable disease alert and response during mass gatherings, 29 were risk assessment of what might happen during the Hajj, proactive surveillance for communicable diseases especially because of outbreaks of MERS-CoV and other viral diseases, and response and action. Additionally, information from monitoring and evaluation of the prevalence and emergence of infectious diseases globally, regionally, and locally is taken into account to develop the public health programme for alert and response for the next Hajj. Regular bulletins also draw attention to any new threats of disease to pilgrims. During any mass gathering, including the Hajj, gastrointestinal infections are a major health hazard. A committee for the removal of treated sewage water liaises with the Ministry of Health to ensure the safety of produce from irrigated vegetable farms. As a precaution, the Ministry of Health strongly enforces the regulation that pilgrims are not allowed to bring fresh food or agricultural products into Saudi Arabia. Also, insecticide is sprayed aerially over Arafat and Mina. All travellers arriving from countries in Africa, South America, and Central America must present a valid vaccination certifi cate for yellow fever at the border. Individuals without such a certifi cate will be off ered the vaccine and then observed for 10 days. 19 To reduce the risk of invasive meningococcal disease, experts from 11 countries in the Middle East recommended vaccination with the quadrivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccine (ACYW135). The immunisation status of each pilgrim is checked and, if relevant, appropriate vaccines and antibiotics are administered in clinical examination rooms and holding areas at the main hubs of the international airport terminals for the Hajj. During Hajj, Saudi Arabia provides free medical care to all pilgrims in 25 hospitals with 5000 beds, including 500 beds for critical care. These results are displayed on the video wall and interactive board. A digital pen was used in 2012 to convert the conventional paper-based system into a digital system for provision of demographic and medical data. Thus, the entire demographic and health data for each case can be captured and relayed rapidly. Several outbreaks of infectious diseases have been recorded at the Hajj. 37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] Bacterial and viral pneumonia are common causes of hospital admission in pilgrims. Pulmonary tuberculosis was a leading cause of hospital admission in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Strategies to reduce the transmission of tuberculosis during the Hajj and development of an evidence base for appropriate intervention measures remains one of the priorities for the Saudi Ministry of Health. 50 In 2009, fewer than 100 cases of infl uenza A H1N1 were reported during Hajj at the peak of the pandemic, and only 26 confi rmed cases during Umrah. Two major outbreaks of Hajj-related meningococcal disease have been reported in Saudi Arabia. All cases of diarrhoea and people living in the same camps as the cases are quarantined and their contacts are traced. 30 
 The Hajj attracts increasing numbers of pilgrims every year. The Saudi Ministry of Health established the Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine in 2012 with the headquarters in Riyadh. This centre is a virtual research network of UK academic and public health institutions in partnership with the WHO Collaborating Centre on Mass Gatherings Medicine and WHO Global Capacity Alert and Response. 33] [34] [35] [72] [73] [74] [75] The centre's fi rst group of ten Saudi physicians has embarked on a diploma programme for mass gatherings medicine approved by the Saudi Council for Health Specialties. Through provision of a scientifi c evidence base the Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine aims to drive the best health promotion, prevention guidelines and practice, and health education for attendees at the Hajj and other mass gatherings.

Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.
 In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.
 Findings From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by nextgeneration sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
 Interpretation Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.","The Health Commission of Hubei province, China, first announced a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia on Dec 31, 2019. 1 27 patients were initially reported, which was subsequently revised to 41 on Jan 11, 2020, with seven severe cases and one death. 2 Some patients were reported to have radiographic ground-glass lung changes; normal or lower than average white blood cell lymphocyte, and platelet counts; hypoxaemia; and deranged liver and renal function. Most were said to be geographically linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which was subsequently reported by journalists to be selling freshly slaughtered game animals. 3 To date, no evidence of person-to-person transmission or affected health-care workers has been published in the scientific literature. The Chinese health authority said that the patients initially tested negatively for common respiratory viruses and bacteria, but later tested positive for a novel coronavirus. 2 The virus was soon isolated and its genome sequenced by a number of Chinese scientists. 4 The virus was tentatively named by WHO as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Here, we report the epidemiological, clinical, radiological, laboratory, and genomic findings of a family cluster of five patients in Shenzhen who had a history of travel to Wuhan, and one other family member who has not travelled to Wuhan.
 On Jan 10, 2020, we initially enrolled two patients who initially presented to The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital (Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China) with fever, respiratory symptoms, and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs. Subsequently, between Jan 11, and Jan 15, 2020 , five other members of this family also pre sented to our hospital for the assessment of their health conditions. We recorded and analysed the history, physical findings, and haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigation results. All laboratory procedures for clinical samples have been previously reported. 5 Briefly, nasopharyngeal and throat swabs and stool and urine samples were taken and put into viral transport media. Plasma was separated from EDTA bottles and serum were separated from clotted blood bottles.
 This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital (number [2015] 90). We obtained written consent from the patients.
 Respiratory samples of the patients were tested for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay (GeneXpert System, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 6 To detect the presence of 18 -4] , Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae), samples were tested using BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 plus (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 7 The two faecal samples were taken from the patients who had diarrhoea as part of their symptoms, and the samples were tested by BioFire FilmArray Gastrointestinal panel (bioMérieux) for 22 diarrhoeal pathogens.
 Reverse transcription was done using the SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) as previously described. 8 The reaction mixture (10 μL) contained 5·5 μL of RNA, 2 μL of 5 × SuperScript IV buffer, 0·5 μL of 100 mM dithiothreitol, 0·5 μL of 10 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) mixture, 0·5 μL of 50 μM random hexamers, 0·5 μL of SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (200 U/μL), and 0·5 μl of RNase-free water. The mixtures were incubated at 23°C for 10 min, followed by 50°C for 10 min and 80°C for 10 min. The PCR mixture (25 μL) contained 1 μL of cDNA, 2·5 μL of 10X PCR buffer II, 2 μL of 25 mM MgCl 2 , 0·5 μL of 10 mM dNTP mix, 2·5 μL of each 10 μM forward and reverse primer, 0·125 μL of AmpliTaq Gold Polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA; 5 U/μL), and nuclease-free water.
 The first set of primers was the forward pri mer (5ʹ-CAAGTGGGGTAAGGCTAGACTTT-3ʹ) and the reverse primer (5ʹ-ACTTAGGATAATCCCAACCCAT-3ʹ) targeting 344 bp of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of all severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coro naviruses. The second set of primers was designed after our first 2019-nCoV genome sequence by Nanopore sequencing from
 Evidence before this study We searched PubMed on Jan 13, 2020, with no starting date limitations, using the terms ""family"", ""pneumonia"", ""Wuhan"", ""coronavirus"", and ""novel"" for articles in English. Our search did not reveal any reports of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan before 2020. We only noted family clusters of pneumonia due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2012.
 The epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of unexplained pneumonia in a Shenzhen family cluster connected to a Wuhan hospital were presented. The diagnostic tests from relevant clinical samples confirmed the presence of a novel coronavirus in five of six patients with radiological changes of viral pneumonia. The phylogenetic analysis of this novel coronavirus suggested its linkage to a possible animal source.
 Although this novel coronavirus might have first originated from animals and now jumped into humans, the possibility of person-to-person transmission could not be excluded, as seen in this family cluster with no known history of exposure to markets or animals, and rapid intercity spread might be possible by air travel. Vigilant epidemiological control in the community and health-care facilities is important to prevent another SARS-like epidemic. stayed with patient 7. The boxes with an internal red cross are the dates on which patients 1 and 3 or relatives 1, 2, and 3 had stayed overnight (white boxes) at or had visited (blue boxes) the hospital in which relative 1 was admitted for febrile pneumonia. The information of relatives 1-5 was provided by patient 3.
 No virological data were available. Generalised weakness the positive clinical samples: the forward primer (5ʹ-CCTACTAAATTAAATGATCTCTGCTTTACT-3ʹ) and the reverse primer (5ʹ-CAAGCTATAACGCAGCCTGTA-3ʹ) targeting the 158 bp of Spike (S) gene of this novel coronavirus. These sets were used for PCR using an automated thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) with a hot start at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR products with correct target size were purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Both strands of PCR products were sequenced with an ABI 3500xl Dx Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using the PCR primers. During the set up of the assays, we initialy used SARS-CoV cDNA as a positive control for RdRp assay and gene-synthesised fragment for Spike assay. Thereafter, diluted samples from positive patients were used as the positive control for both assays. All positive results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
 A total of 140 µL of respiratory, urine, stool, serum, or plasma samples from each patient was subjected to RNA extraction into 50 µL elutes using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Forward (5ʹ-CCTACTAAATTAAATGATCTCTGCTTTACT-3ʹ) and reverse (5ʹ-CAAGCTATAACGCAGCCTGTA-3ʹ) primers targeting the S gene of this novel coronavirus were used for the assay. Real-time RT-PCR assay was done using QuantiNova SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) in a LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), as previously described. 9 Each 20 μL reaction mixture contained 10 μL of 2 × QuantiNova SYBR Green RT-PCR Master Mix, 0·2 μL of QN SYBR Green RT-Mix, 1 μM of each 10 μM forward and reverse primers, and 5 μL of RNA and nuclease-free water. Reactions were incubated at 50°C for 10 min and 95°C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 30 s, and then subjected to melting curve analysis (95°C for 5 s, 65°C for 1 min, followed by a gradual increase in temperature to 97°C with continuous recording of fluorescence).
 Whole-genome sequencing was done using Oxford Nanopore MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) supplemented by Sanger sequencing. RNA was extracted from host cell-depleted nasopharyngeal and sputum samples using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, as described previously. [10] [11] [12] Whole-genome amplification of the coronavirus was done using a sequence-independent single-primer amplification ap proach, as described previously. 13 Bioinformatics analyses were done using an inhouse pipeline. Details on the library preparation and bioinformatics analysis are described in the appendix (pp 1-2). The con sensus sequence of HKU-SZ-002a (accession number MN938384) and HKU-SZ-005b (accession number MN975262) have been deposited into GenBank. Raw reads, after excluding human reads, have been deposited into BioProject (accession number PRJNA601630).
 Phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA X software using the RT-PCR amplicons of partial RdRp and S gene regions of the strains detected in this study and other related coro naviruses. 14 The trees of the amplicons were constructed using maximum likelihood methods with bootstrap values calculated from 1000 trees, with human coro navirus 229E as outgroup. The phylogenetic tree of the full-length genome was constructed by use of the neighbour-joining method using the Tamura-Nei model with a gamma distribution. The bootstrap values were calculated from 1000 trees and values only greater than 70 were displayed.

 The family cluster of six patients (patients 1-6) flew from Shenzhen to Wuhan on Dec 29, 2019, and flew back to Shenzhen on Jan 4, 2020 (figure 1). This travel period overlapped with the time period after the announcement of the first case of Wuhan pneumonia (symptom onset The family stayed in the same hotel throughout their travel. Patients 1 and 2 stayed in one room and patients 3-6 stayed in another room. After patient 4 developed fever and diarrhoea on Jan 1, 2020, patients 5 and 6 stayed in the same room as patients 1 and 2, and patient 3 stayed with patient 4. Patients 1-6 had met with their relatives (relatives 2-5: one female cousin and three aunts of patient 3) every day during their stay in Wuhan for meals. Relative 4 made frequent visits to the wet market but not the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which had been implicated by the health authority to be the epidemic centre. Relatives 2-5 have developed fever, cough, and weak ness since Jan 4, 2020. Patients 1 and 3 had visited relative 1, aged 1 year, and the son of relative 2, on Dec 29, 2019, in a Wuhan hospital, who had been treated in hospital for febrile pneumonia (relative 2 accompanied relative 1 in the hospital over night; relative 1 later recovered and was discharged home on Dec 31, 2019). Patient 3, but not patient 1, had worn a surgical mask during the hospital visit. The incubation period was estimated to be between 3 and 6 days. Patients 1-4 were symptomatic, and they only presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset. For the two asymptomatic children (patients 5 and 6), patient 5 had ground-glass lung opacities identified by CT scan. Unlike patient 5, who was aged 10 years and non-compliant to parental guidance, patient 6, who was aged 7 years and reported by her mother to wear a surgical mask for most of the time during the period in Wuhan, was not found to be infected by virological or radiological investigations. The blood tests and CT scan of patient 6 were normal. After they returned to Shenzhen on Jan 4, 2020, patients 3-6 stayed in the same household of patient 7 (mother of patient 4) until Jan 11, 2020. Patient 7, who did not go to Wuhan or visit Shenzhen markets in the preceding 14 days, developed back pain and generalised weakness and attended the outpatient clinic at another local hospital on Jan 8, 2020. She was given cefaclor for 3 days with no improvement. She developed fever and dry cough and attended the same outpatient clinic and was treated with intravenous cefazolin (two doses) on Jan 12, 2020. She was admitted to our hospital on Jan 15, 2020, due to persistent symptoms.
 Of the six patients with pulmonary infiltrates (patients 1-5 and patient 7) on CT scans, three were male and three were female, with ages ranging 10-66 years (table 1). Four had chronic comorbidities and five had history of fever. The three older patients (aged >60 years: patients 1, 2, and 7) had dry cough and generalised weakness. Patient 4 had productive cough. Patients 3 and 4 were younger adults and had diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract symptoms including sore throat, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhoea. Patient 3 also had pleuritic chest pain. Except for patient 4, all six had normal or lower than average total white blood cell counts. The three older patients (patients 1, 2, and 7) all had substantially increased C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Patients 1 and 2 also had lymphopenia, mild thrombocytopenia, and extended activated thromboplastin time. All six patients showed multifocal patchy groundglass opacities, especially around the peripheral parts of the lungs on CT scans, which were compatible with changes seen in viral pneumonia (figure 2). No other clinical or radiological changes of lung congestion, fibrosis, or cancer to explain these ground-glass lung changes, or any concomitant radiological changes of dense consoli dation, pleural effu sion, lymphadenopathy, or pneu momediastinum were seen.
 All respiratory samples were negative on two point-ofcare multiplex PCR systems for 18 respiratory viral and four bacterial targets. The two faecal samples from patients 3 and 4 who had preceding diarrhoea were negative on a multiplex PCR assay for common diarrhoeal viruses, bacteria, and parasites (table 2). The respiratory samples of patients 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 were positive for both RdRp and S genes by conventional RT-PCR, and for the S gene by real-time RT-PCR, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of all amplicons (appendix pp [3] [4] [5] . Although the respiratory samples of patient 3 were negative for both RdRp and S gene (collected 9 days after symptom onset), she was still regarded as an infected case because she was strongly epidemiologically linked to the Wuhan hospital exposure and radiologically showing multifocal ground-glass lung opacities. Only the serum sample of patient 2 was positive and all other patients' serum, urine, and faecal samples were negative for this novel coronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis of the PCR products showed that the amplicon sequences of both RdRp and S genes from these five patients were novel (figure 3) and different from other known human or animal coronaviruses, including the SARS and bat SARS-related coronaviruses.
 Two complete virus genomes (HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b) were sequenced using Nanopore technology and showed a novel coronavirus that is most closely related to those of the bat SARS-like coronavirus bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (NCBI accession number MG772934) and bat-SL-CoVZC45 (NCBI accession number MG772933). Their genome organisation is typical of a lineage B betacoronavirus. The size of the virus genomes from patient 2 (HKU-SZ-002a) and patient 5 (HKU-SZ-005b) are around 29·8 kilobases with GC content of 38% (appendix p 6). HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b differ from each other by only two bases. One of them is a non-synonymous mutation at amino acid position 336 of non-structural protein 4 (Ser336 for HKU-SZ-002a; Leu336 for HKU-SZ-005b; figure 4 ). Although amino acid sequence of the N-terminal domain of Spike subunit 1 of this novel coronavirus is approximately 66% identical to those of the SARS-related coronaviruses, and the core domain of the receptor binding domain of this novel coronavirus has about 68% amino acid identity with those of the SARS-related coronavirus, the protein sequence of the external subdomain region of receptor binding domain of Spike subunit 1 has only 39% identity, which might affect the choice of human receptor and therefore the biological behaviour of this virus (figure 4).
 All six patients were admitted to hospital under isolation, supportive care, and remained stable as of Jan 20, 2020.
 We report here a familial cluster of unexplained pneumonia due to 2019-nCoV. Six of seven family members had radiological changes of viral pneumonia, among whom five (patients 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7) tested positive for 2019-nCoV by RT-PCR. Five patients (patients 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7) had associated symptoms at the time of presentation. Complete genome sequences of the two strains from patients 2 and 5 showed almost complete nucleotide identity with each other, and were closest to the bat SARS-related coronaviruses reported in 2018. Several possible scenarios of transmission exist. The first and most likely scenario is that one virologically documented patient with pneumonia (patient 1) acquired the infection from a Wuhan hospital while visiting their relative (relative 1) and then patients 1-5 transmitted the virus to patient 7 on returning to Shenzhen. The second scenario is that patients 1-5 have directly acquired the infection from relatives 2-5 and transmitted it to patient 7 on returning to Shenzhen. But this scenario is less likely because patients 1-5 developed symptoms before relatives 2-5. The third scenario is that patients 1-5 acquired the infection from an unknown common source in Wuhan and transmitted it to patient 7 when back in Shenzhen. For the patients' relatives (relatives 2-5), they could have acquired the infection from the hospital or the community, although no virological confirmation was possible and they had no animal contacts, game food, or visits to the Huanan sea food wholesale market. Notably, patient 1 or patient 3 who had visited Wuhan hospital might have been infectious before symptom onset because patient 5 was shedding virus without symp toms. These findings suggested that person-to-person transmission and intercity spread of 2019-nCoV by air travel are possible, supporting reports of infected Chinese travellers from Wuhan being detected in other geographical regions. Many of the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of this novel coronavirus pneumonia were similar to those of SARS patients in 2003. 8, 15, 16 The incubation period of the Wuhan pneumonia appeared similar to that of SARS. The attack rate is rather high, up to 83% if we included the five patients (patients 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) with unexplained ground-glass radiological changes of the lungs on CT scan as the case definition in this family outbreak after visiting Wuhan. A rather unexpected finding from the lung CT scan of patient 5, which was done on the insistence by the nervous parents, also showed ground-glass pneumonic changes. Patient 5 was later confirmed virologically to have an asymptomatic infection. Although asymptomatic patients with SARS were uncommon, they were documented in our retrospective study in the minor 2004 SARS outbreak after reopening of the wildlife market in Guangzhou. 17 Notably, patients 3 and 4 were afebrile at presentation to our hospital. These cryptic cases of walking pneumonia might serve as a possible source to propagate the outbreak. Further studies on the epidemiological significance of these asymptomatic cases are warranted.
 The symptoms of this novel pneumonia were also nonspecific. The three oldest patients in this family with comorbidities had more severe systemic symptoms of generalised weakness and dry cough. As expected, they might have decreased total white blood cell, lymphocyte, or platelet counts, with also extended activated thromboplastin time and increased C-reactive protein level. The multifocal ground-glass changes on lung CT scan were typical of viral pneumonia. Their lung involvement was also more diffuse and extensive than those of the younger patients, whose blood test results were largely normal. Patient 4, who had a history of chronic sinusitis, might have a bacterial superinfection because he had a productive cough instead of a dry cough. He also had a high white blood cell count, although the bacterial test was negative.
 Interestingly, the two younger adults (patients 3 and 4) initially had diarrhoea, which was also reported in 10·6% (15 of 142) of our SARS patients at presentation; 18 however, the subsequent faecal samples of patients 3 and 4 that were collected 9-10 days after symptom onset were negative for the virus after the diarrhoea had long subsided. Up to 30% of patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) also have diarrhoea. 19 Sub genomic RNA indicating viral replication was seen in faecal samples of patients with MERS. 20 Moreover, MERS-CoV was shown to survive in simulated fed gastrointestinal juice and the ability to infect intestinal organoid models. 20 Diarrhoea and gastrointestinal involvement are well known in coronavirus infections of animals and humans. 21 On microbiological testing, we did not find any evidence of other known respiratory viral or bacterial infections, but specific RT-PCR assays for two widely separated genome targets-the highly conserved RdRp and the highly variable S genes-were positive for this novel 2019-nCoV. Two complete genome sequences of this novel coronavirus were recovered from the naso pharyngeal swab of patient 2 and the sputum sample of patient 5 with an earlier cycle threshold value indicating a higher viral load. Patient 2 had more underlying comorbidities and clinical features and radiological findings of more severe disease than the other patients included here. Moreover, the serum sample of patient 2 was also positive for 2019-nCoV, which might indicate some virus spillover from the more severely infected lung into the systemic circulation, as previously reported in patients with SARS. 22 Sputum samples were available for testing from patients 5 and 7. The cycle threshold values of the sputum samples were 8-13 cycles earlier than those of throat swabs, indicating higher viral loads detected in the lower respiratory tract. This finding is consistent with the observations in patients with MERS who had higher viral loads in lower respiratory tract samples than in upper respiratory tract samples. 23 Thus, repeat testing of upper respiratory tract samples or testing of lower respiratory tract samples are warranted in clinically suspected cases with an initially negative result in nasopharyngeal or throat swab. Unlike our patients in the 2003 SARS outbreak, 22 we found no evidence of viral shedding in urine and faeces in these six patients. However, improved systematic serial collection and testing of an increased number of such samples is warranted.
 Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, singlestranded RNA viruses, capable of rapid mutation and recombination. They are classified into alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, which both have their gene source from bats and are mainly found in mammals such as bats, rodents, civets, and humans; and gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses, which both have their gene source from birds and are mainly found in birds. [24] [25] [26] Phylogenetic analysis of the PCR amplicon fragments from five of our six patients and the complete virus genome of 29·8 kilobases from patients 2 and 5 showed that the virus is a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the lineage B or subgenus sarbecovirus, which also includes the human SARS coronavirus. The genome of our virus strains are phylo genetically closest to the bat SARS-related coronaviruses first found in the Chinese horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus sinicus, captured in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, China, between 2015 and 2017. 27 Notably, the first SARS-related coronavirus was also discovered in the R sinicus found in Hong Kong, and central and south China in 2005. 28, 29 The full virus genome had about an 89% nucleotide identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45, which makes it a new species. Moreover, the Spike protein of our virus has an 84% nucleotide identity with the bat-SL-CoVZC45 coronavirus and an 78% nucleotide identity with the human SARS coronavirus. Although substantial genetic differences exist between this and other beta coronaviruses, cross reactions in RT-PCR or antibody assays for SARS or other betacoronaviruses are possible if the primers and antigenic epitopes are not carefully chosen, as previously reported. 30 Further studies on the optimal diagnostic tests are warranted.
 In summary, an outbreak of novel coronavirus is ongoing at Wuhan in the winter of 2019-20. Similar to the 2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, Wuhan is also a rapidly flourishing capital city of the Hubei province and the traffic hub of central China. Moreover, both outbreaks were initially connected to wet markets where game animals and meat were sold. In the case of SARS, personto-person transmission was efficient and super-spreading events had led to major outbreaks in hotels and hospitals. Learning from the SARS outbreak, which started as animal-to-human transmission during the first phase of the epidemic, all game meat trades should be optimally regulated to terminate this portal of transmission. But as shown in this study, it is still crucial to isolate patients and trace and quarantine contacts as early as possible because asymptomatic infection appears possible (as shown in one of our patients), educate the public on both food and personal hygiene, and alert health-care workers on compliance to infection control to prevent superspreading events. Unlike the 2003 SARS outbreak, the improved surveillance network and laboratory capability of China was able to recognise this outbreak within a few weeks and announced the virus genome sequences that would allow the development of rapid diagnostic tests and efficient epidemiological control. Our study showed that person-to-person transmission in family homes or hospital, and intercity spread of this novel coronavirus are possible, and therefore vigilant control measures are warranted at this early stage of the epidemic.

We aimed to investigate the epidemiology of MERS-CoV infection in a crowded emergency room outside of the Middle East and the presence of multiple super-spreaders. In May, 2015, two patients with MERS-CoV infection (Patient 1 and Patient 14) sought care in our emergency room at the Samsung Medical Center without knowing they were infected with MERS-CoV. While these patients were in the emergency room, a large number of patients, visitors, and health-care workers were exposed during both events. Since no one developed MERS among contacts who were exposed to Patient 1, only contacts of Patient 14 are reported here. Health-care workers who provided direct care to Patient 14 were initially considered close contacts and were placed into quarantine at home for 14 days from the last day of exposure. Because the total list of visitors was unavailable, we estimated the number of visitors who were in the emergency room by assuming that one patient had at least one visitor during their stay; we also simulated the scenarios of two and four visitors per patient. We calculated overall comparison of attack rates across the groups with χ² test and across zones with Fisher's exact test. Furthermore, this study provides detailed epidemiological data, including a fl oor plan of the emergency room, to understand how MERS-CoV spread by a single super-spreader through several modes of transmission. We used SAS version 9.4 and GraphPad Prism version 6.04 for statistical analyses. More than 200 patients are seen in the emergency room each day; the average duration of stay in the emergency room was 15 h before the MERS-CoV outbreak (see appendix p 2 for details on emergency room overcrowding index). Two negative-pressure rooms are located in the paediatric zone and two are in zone IV. The emergency room has its own radiology suite for emergency room patients only. The sizes of each zone were as follows: zone I 121·7 m², zone II 64·2 m², zone III 168·3 m², and zone IV 223·9 m². There was no funding source for this study. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had fi nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. However, no aerosol-producing procedures, including nebuliser treatments, were given. Additionally, from May 27 to May 29, he went to the radiology suites four times. 11 The median temperature was 23·8°C (range 14·4-32·2), and the median relative humidity was 32·9% (range 27·1-36·8). Patients in group A had the highest attack rate (20% [23 of 117]), compared with 5% (three of 58) in group B and 1% (four of 500) in group C (fi gure 3). No MERS-CoV infection was reported in patients and visitors who had been in the emergency room on May 29 during the time period when they were exposed only to zones II (n=81) or III (n=15), while Patient 14 was confi ned to zone IV. Under the assumption of one visitor per patient and excluding three visitors with confi rmed MERS-CoV infection who were not identifi ed in the initial visitor contact investigation (appendix p 5), the overall attack rate for visitors was 6% (38 of 683).

 Error bars represent 95% CI. Although they were not involved in the direct care for Patient 14, they visited the emergency room between May 27 and May 29. There were no secondary cases from health-care workers among contacts during the their duty hours. Overcrowding is an important issue for this outbreak and is also a common feature of modern medicine. 13 Among patients who stayed in various locations, those who overlapped with Patient 14 at the radiology suite or registration area had higher attack rates (5%) than the rest of the patients (1%), suggesting that transmission might occur by even brief exposures to recently contaminated objects or encounters with individuals carrying a super-spreader. The diff erence of transmissibility between these two individuals could be caused by a combination of factors such as the time from onset of disease, clinical symptoms, duration of contact exposure, pattern of behaviour inside and near the emergency room, and kinetics of viral shedding. Suspicion for unusual infections should be maintained if patients do not or cannot report accurate histories. Emergency preparedness at a national level and communication and support from government agencies are imperative to prevent and control any serious outbreak.

Identifi cation of individuals with tuberculosis and prompt initiation of eff ective treatment to rapidly render them non-infectious is crucial to this task. However, in settings of high tuberculosis burden, active case-fi nding is often not implemented, resulting in long delays in diagnosis and treatment. A range of strategies to fi nd cases and ensure prompt and correct treatment have been shown to be eff ective in high tuberculosis-burden settings. The populationlevel eff ect of targeted active case-fi nding on reducing tuberculosis incidence has been shown by studies and projected by mathematical modelling. The inclusion of targeted active case-fi nding in a comprehensive epidemic-control strategy for tuberculosis should contribute substantially to a decrease in tuberculosis incidence.","Tuberculosis is a global epidemic with an estimated 9 million new cases and 1·5 million deaths in 2013. 1 Although tuberculosis has been curable for almost 70 years-and despite the fact that millions of individuals are treated every year-the annual rate of decline of tuberculosis incidence globally has averaged only 1·5% for more than a decade. 1,2 Part of the reason for this sluggish progress is that a substantial proportion of people who fall sick with tuberculosis are never diagnosed and treated. WHO estimates that 3 million people with tuberculosis are ""missed"" each year by health systems, leading to the persistence of infectious cases and the airborne disease's transmission within families and communities. 1 Transmission of tuberculosis leads to new infections and new cases of disease. If the global tuberculosis epidemic is to be stopped, not only must existing cases be treated, but the transmission that is constantly producing new infections and cases must also be halted. Trying to eliminate tuberculosis without stopping transmission would be like trying to empty a basin full of water without fi rst turning off the tap that fi lls it.
 Crucial steps to stopping transmission are fi nding people who have the disease and ensuring that they are immediately put on eff ective treatment so that they can be rapidly rendered non-infectious. In low-incidence, high-resource settings such as the USA, Canada, and the European Union, policies of targeted active case-fi nding are in place to limit transmission of tuberculosis in households, communities, and congregate settings. [3] [4] [5] Targeted active case-fi nding means actively seeking out and screening individuals at increased risk of having the disease so that they can be diagnosed early, and, through correct treatment, rendered non-infectious. Targeted active case-fi nding is a fundamental strategy for disease control that has been used to stop epidemics ranging from smallpox to severe acute respiratory syndrome to Ebola virus disease, and has been recognised as a crucial component of the epidemic-control response to tuberculosis since the 1930s. [6] [7] [8] By contrast, most tuberculosis programmes in lowincome and middle-income countries with high burdens of tuberculosis have adopted policies that rely on passive case-fi nding-waiting for the sick to seek care if they are able. Driven in large part by concerns over cost, this strategy prioritises treatment success among passively detected cases and considers case detection to be of secondary importance. 9-11 However, by the time sick individuals seek treatment for their symptoms, they have been infectious for some time, and transmission in the family and community has already occurred. 12, 13 • Stopping transmission is an essential component of halting the global tuberculosis epidemic; this requires fi nding individuals with tuberculosis and promptly initiating the correct treatment • Actively searching for tuberculosis cases in high-risk groups is an effi cient and eff ective way to improve tuberculosis case detection • Initiation of eff ective treatment rapidly renders patients non-infectious • The effi cacy of strategies to actively fi nd cases and ensure prompt eff ective treatment has been shown in high tuberculosis-burden settings • The ability of targeted active case-fi nding and prompt treatment to reduce tuberculosis incidence in the population has been suggested by both empirical evaluations and mathematical modelling • By applying existing knowledge comprehensively and exhaustively to stop the production of new infections and new cases, we can make a substantial impact on the tuberculosis epidemic
 The reliance on passive case-fi nding for tuberculosis has contributed to the present failure to prevent transmission at the level required to turn the tide of the tuberculosis epidemic. 12 Improvement of case detection by actively searching for sick individuals is only the fi rst step in stopping transmission. The second step is to ensure that individuals with tuberculosis are rapidly diagnosed and put on an eff ective treatment regimen. Delays in diagnosis and treatment contribute to persisting transmission of tuberculosis. 12,13 Diagnostic and treatment policies in high tuberculosis-burden countries have largely relied on conventional sputum smear microscopy as the main diagnostic technique and on a standard empirical treatment regimen of four fi rst-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. 14 However, sputum smear microscopy has severe limitations: it fails to detect about half of all tuberculosis cases; 15 its sensitivity in children sick with tuberculosis is about 10%; 15 its sensitivity in people living with HIV who are sick with tuberculosis is less than 30%; 16, 17 it cannot diagnose patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, who represented 15% of notifi ed cases in 2013; 1 and it cannot detect drug resistance. Furthermore, although cases that are detectable by sputum smear microscopy are generally more infectious than those that are not, the nondetectable cases have been shown to cause 13-17% of transmission in low-incidence settings. 18, 19 Reliance on smear micro scopy rather than more sensitive procedures for diagnosis thus allows infectious cases to remain undetected in the community for longer. In addition, policies that rely on both sputum smear microscopy and empirical treatment with a standard fi rst-line antituberculosis regimen can result in long periods of ineff ective treatment for patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis.
 The tuberculosis epidemic cannot be successfully and rapidly curbed without use of recognised control measures for communicable diseases, including targeted active case-fi nding and prompt initiation of the correct treatment. These activities are both feasible and eff ective in high tuberculosis-burden settings at present, despite the challenges facing health systems in many of these countries. Thus, with adequate resource investment and political will, substantial decreases in tuberculosis incidence are possible.
 Since the 1930s, a range of approaches to targeted active case-fi nding, tailored to local epidemiology, have been shown to improve tuberculosis case detection. 6,20,21 By focusing on populations at high risk for tuberculosis, targeted active case-fi nding strategies detect substantially more cases per number of people assessed than would be detected by screening in the general population. The expected yields of a few common approaches are described in table 1.
 Once a tuberculosis case is identifi ed, further transmission from that individual can be stopped almost immediately by initiation of eff ective treatment. A seminal prospective, randomised, controlled study 32 done at the Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Center, Madras (now Chennai), India, in the 1950s reported that household members of patients with tuberculosis who were treated at home had no greater risk of tuberculosis disease or infection after 5 years than household members of patients who were treated in sanatoria and thus restricted from contact with their families. Furthermore, since the 1950s, independent studies have measured the infectiousness of patients with tuberculosis who were being treated in hospital using an experimental model in which highly susceptible guineapigs were exposed to the air from a ward of patients with tuberculosis, and then tested for tuberculosis infection. These experiments repeatedly showed a rapid reduction in the patients' infectiousness after initiation of eff ective therapy, even while they might remain sputum smear positive. [33] [34] [35] In the earliest experiments, patients began treatment on the day of admission to the hospital; guineapigs exposed to patients who started eff ective treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis were only 2% as likely to be infected as guineapigs exposed to untreated patients, suggesting that the patients were rendered non-infec tious almost immediately after initiation of multidrug therapy. 33 In later studies using a similar experimental set-up, rapid attenuation of infectiousness was reported for patients with drugresistant tuberculosis who were treated eff ectively with regimens that contained suffi cient drugs to which the infecting strains were susceptible. 34 By contrast, these guineapig exposure studies have repeatedly reported most infections to be associated with patients who have undiagnosed or ineff ectively treated drug-resistant tuberculosis, under scoring the importance of rapid initiation of the correct regimen and the danger of protracted infectiousness in these patients. [33] [34] [35] [36] Epidemiologically, the continuing transmission of drugresistant strains that results from diagnostic failure or an absence of eff ective treatment is suggested by the prevalence of drug resistance in patients who have never

 Untargeted screening in general population in 22 high tuberculosis-burden countries 1 0·1-0·7% The combination of active case-fi nding and prompt initiation of eff ective treatment reduces transmission by removing infectious cases from the population before additional transmission occurs. Although the eff ect of these activities at a population level is diffi cult to measure over a short timeframe, evidence suggests that they have a role in reducing tuberculosis incidence. In a com munityrandomised trial in Brazil, eight com munities matched according to socioeconomic indicators were assigned to either an intervention or control condition. In the intervention communities, outreach workers actively sought out household contacts of tuberculosis cases for prompt screening, and treatment was given for both tuberculosis disease and infection. 37 The control communities received the local standard of care, which relied on contacts to present to health facilities for assessment, and did not routinely provide preventive therapy. At baseline, the two sets of communities had nearly identical annual tuberculosis case notifi cation rates (340 cases per 100 000 individuals in communities receiving the intervention and 339 per 100 000 in the controls). After 5 years, the intervention communities had a statistically signifi cant 15% lower annual tuber culosis case notifi cation rate than the control com munities (p=0·04). A community-randomised trial in Zambia and South Africa allocated 24 communities to four intervention conditions involving diff erent com binations of casefi nding interventions such that each group was similar with respect to baseline prevalence of tuberculosis and HIV infection, and demographic characteristics. 38 After 3 years, communities in which household contacts of patients with tuberculosis were systematically assessed had an 18% lower prevalence of tuberculosis in adults (p=0·095) and a 55% lower rate of tuberculosis infection in children (p=0·063) than communities in which household contacts were not assessed.
 Targeted active case-fi nding and prompt initiation of eff ective treatment are crucial components of epidemic control for infectious diseases. Although optimum methods for both can vary across settings, general strategies that have proven eff ective in a range of settings can provide a starting point for implementation. Table 2 presents key activities and strategies to be considered for stopping tuberculosis transmission in the context of a comprehensive approach to stopping the tuberculosis epidemic.
 In view of the inability of passive case-fi nding alone to halt tuberculosis transmission, targeted active casefi nding is important in all settings. However, diff erent characteristics are associated with increased tuberculosis risk in diff erent places, and the effi cacy of any single approach to active case-fi nding can vary widely across settings. 20 Thus, each tuberculosis programme has to identify what combination of targeted active case-fi nding activities is the most eff ective in the local context.
 One high-risk group that is present in all settings is contacts of patients with tuberculosis. Contact
 Targeted active case-fi nding Perform contact investigations of patients with tuberculosis Screen clients attending health facilities Use programme data to identify groups of people that account for a disproportionate share of the tuberculosis burden; groups can be defi ned by individual risk factors or geography Consider, pilot, and assess diff erent targeted active case-fi nding strategies to fi nd out what works best in a given setting Increase uptake of screening through awareness campaigns, community engagement, initiatives to mitigate stigma, and incentives Prevention of transmission in health facilities Provide paper masks to individuals suspected of having tuberculosis until they are receiving eff ective treatment Reduce contact between individuals suspected of having tuberculosis and other people seeking care, particularly susceptible individuals such as young children and people with HIV; contact can be reduced by having patients wait in diff erent areas on the basis of risk and symptoms, or by scheduling clinics for diff erent types of patients at diff erent times Expedite diagnosis for individuals suspected of having tuberculosis Open windows in waiting areas or use outdoor waiting areas where feasible Prompt initiation of eff ective therapy Develop protocols and strengthen health systems to ensure that results of diagnostic procedures are received and acted on promptly Use chest radiography and clinical algorithms in addition to bacteriological testing for diagnosis, especially for young children and people with HIV Use rapid molecular tests that can detect both tuberculosis and drug resistance Initiate presumptive treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis when a contact of a patient with drug-resistant tuberculosis is diagnosed with tuberculosis Formation of partnerships Integrate tuberculosis care with other health-care services such as HIV care and maternal-child health programmes Engage community members who advocate for best practices, encourage health-care-seeking behaviours, and support patients through treatment Partner with private sector providers to ensure that patients with tuberculosis receive timely diagnoses and appropriate treatment, and that they are reported to the national tuberculosis programme even if they receive care in the private sector investi gation refers to the process of systematically identifying and screening contacts of patients with tuberculosis. 39 Since the risk of transmission increases with the intensity and duration of contact, contact investigation in the household and other places where patients with tuber culosis live (eg, workers' dormitories, prisons) is a logical case-fi nding strategy to consider in all countries. Common components of contact investigations include patient interviews in the clinic, asking patients to bring household members and other close contacts (particularly children) to the clinic for assessment, and home visits by a health-care worker to identify and screen household members. Although programmes generally prioritise the most infectious cases for contact investigation, investi gations of children, who generally have non-infectious forms of tuberculosis, can lead to detection of infectious adult cases; this is sometimes called a source case investigation since transmission is assumed to have occurred from the adult to the child. At a children's hospital in Texas, USA, 17-24% of children diagnosed with tuberculosis were accompanied to the hospital by an adult with previously undiagnosed pulmonary tuber culosis. 40, 41 Another generally applicable strategy for targeted active case-fi nding is regular screening of social or demographic risk groups that contribute a disproportionate number of cases to the local tuberculosis burden (panel). This strategy is important in both low-burden settings and high-burden settings. Analysis of routinely collected programme data can help identify high-risk groups in a particular location. Furthermore, in some high-burden settings, analysis of programme data can identify geographical hotspots where community-level interventions such as door-to-door screening and deployment of mobile diagnostic units could be a high-yield activity (see Theron and colleagues, 46 paper 1 in this Series). In countries where genotyping is practised, such as China, the combination of genotype and geographical data might allow even more specifi c identifi cation of transmission hotspots.
 One practical consideration for the implementation of targeted active case-fi nding activities is how to convince individuals to undergo screening for a stigmatised disease, especially if screening requires time and eff ort on the part of the individual. Strategies that have proven successful at encouraging uptake of services for other stigmatised health issues (eg, HIV, leprosy) have included coupling services for a stigmatised health issue with services for a non-stigmatised one, and communitybased awareness campaigns to reduce stigma. 47 Several successful active case-fi nding initiatives for tuberculosis have incorporated advocacy and community mobilisation activities into their strategies. 20 Material incentives can also be useful in encouraging people to undergo screening; two randomised controlled trials in the USA reported that small monetary incentives doubled the proportion of homeless people who returned to the clinic to have their tuberculin skin tests read. 48 Another practical consideration is what screening and diagnostic algorithm to use. Strategies for targeted active case-fi nding typically use screening algorithms that progressively reduce the number of individuals at each step of assessment to ensure that time-intensive and resource-intensive procedures such as sputum culture and full clinical assessment by a physician are done for indivi duals who are likely to have tuberculosis. A common fi rst step is to ask individuals about symptoms and risk factors, and move only those who are symptomatic or high risk to the next step of assessment. However, the choice of symptoms included in the initial interview can greatly aff ect the performance of the symptom screen, with tradeoff s between sensitivity and specifi city. In a prevalence survey in western Kenya, 49 where the prevalence of bacteriologically confi rmed pulmonary tuberculosis was 0·6%, the presence of cough for 2 weeks or longer had 52% sensitivity and 89% specifi city in predicting tuberculosis, whereas the presence of any tuberculosis symptom (cough, haemoptysis, weight loss, fever, or night sweats) had 90% sensitivity and 32% specifi city. Furthermore, for children, additional symptoms such as reduced playfulness and failure to reach an ageappropriate weight are important components of a symptom screen. Finally, the comparatively high sensitivity (94%) and specifi city (73%) of an abnormal chest radiograph for predicting tuberculosis in the western Kenya survey 49 (with similar results reported from other prevalence surveys) strongly supports inclusion of chest radiography into screening algorithms.
 The decision to implement targeted active case-fi nding activities has practical implications for the tuberculosis Panel: Examples of targeted active case-fi nding policies in risk groups that contribute disproportionately to local tuberculosis burden Across the WHO African Region in 2013, the prevalence of HIV in adults aged 15-49 years was 4·5%, 42 but an estimated 34% of tuberculosis cases were associated with HIV. 1 Screening people with HIV for tuberculosis is therefore a crucial strategy for tuberculosis case detection.
 In Russia, about 0·5% of the population is incarcerated. However, prisoners accounted for 27% of tuberculosis cases in 1995. 43 Since then, Russia has focused on addressing tuberculosis in prisons, enforcing both mandatory screening and directly observed treatment. 43 These policies have been credited with reducing the proportion of tuberculosis cases that were detected in prisons to 12% in 2004.
 In the USA, tuberculosis incidence among homeless people is roughly 10 times the incidence in the general population. 44 National guidelines recommend that staff in homeless shelters monitor clients for persistent cough and ensure prompt assessment either at the shelter or by providing transportation to a health-care facility. 45 programme and the health system as a whole. Active case-fi nding activities require staff and diagnostic resources in addition to those already in place to support passive case-fi nding. Additionally, if active case-fi nding activities are successful, the number of patients requiring treatment will increase in the short term, even though subsequent reduction in transmission should reduce the number of cases in the long term. Therefore, anticipation of increased diagnostic and treatment capacity should be part of the planning process for any active case-fi nding activity. Furthermore, monitoring and assessment should be planned to ensure that the people screened by an active case-fi nding initiative are those at the highest risk rather than those who are easiest to reach, and that increases in diagnoses represent true case detection and not overdiagnosis. Finally, while active case-fi nding activities have as their main goal the prompt diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis disease, they can also provide a platform for the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis infection and exposure to prevent development of future cases (see Rangaka and colleagues, 50 paper 3 in this Series). Therefore, the coordination of case-fi nding and prevention eff orts should be considered.
 Health facilities are a unique setting in which targeted active case-fi nding can be combined with administrative and environmental infection control measures to prevent nosocomial tuberculosis transmission. Facilities where individuals who are sick spend hours waiting for health care in crowded and poorly ventilated waiting areas can promote transmission within the facility. Detection of these cases as soon as possible is thus crucial to prevent transmission. One strategy to identify cases and prevent nosocomial transmission is to screen individuals in waiting areas for tuberculosis symptoms and quickly separate symptomatic individuals from the general population. This type of rapid triage was instrumental in halting nosocomial transmission during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Asia. 7 For tuberculosis, the strategy ""Finding TB cases Actively, Separating safely, and Treating eff ectively"" (FAST) has helped facilities introduce procedures that reduce the risk and duration of exposure to tuberculosis for both patients and health-care workers. 51 The FAST strategy includes cough monitoring in waiting rooms and admission wards to identify individuals who might have tuberculosis, rapid diagnosis for those with tuberculosis symptoms, prompt separation of patients with suspected drug-resistant tuberculosis, and rapid initiation of eff ective treatment for all forms of tuberculosis. Although designed for health-care facilities, the FAST strategy could be adapted to other congregate settings as well. 52 Additionally, a range of administrative and environmental interventions can further augment eff orts to prevent transmission within facilities, without substantial additional resource investment (table 3) .
 Implementation of the FAST strategy in hospitals has reduced both unsuspected tuberculosis and delays in the initiation of eff ective treatment. After implementing FAST, the National Institute of Diseases of the Chest Hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, reported that 9% of patients admitted as so-called non-tuberculosis patients in fact had tuberculosis. 51 In a tuberculosis hospital in Voronezh, Russia, implementation of FAST using a molecular diagnostic test reduced the time from admission to initiation of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment to less than 5 days, compared with the weeks that patients would wait to receive results from mycobacterial culture and conventional drug susceptibility testing. 51
 The FAST strategy provides an integrated and streamlined approach that combines active case-fi nding, diagnosis, and treatment into a single facility-based protocol. When active case-fi nding is focused outside a health-care facility, strategies are needed to ensure that individuals identifi ed as being at risk for tuberculosis are linked to appropriate diagnosis and treatment, since searching for cases will not have any eff ect unless these cases are promptly diagnosed and eff ectively treated.
 In view of the limitations of sputum smear microscopy, the goal to diagnose all tuberculosis cases can only be accomplished through the use of other modalities such as radiography, molecular diagnostic tests, bacteriological culture, and clinical algorithms. 21 Because children and people with HIV are less likely than others to have bacteriological confi rmation of tuberculosis, use of clinical algorithms for these two groups is essential. [55] [56] [57] 
 Requesting that patients with tuberculosis wear surgical masks When admitted to hospital, patients receiving multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment at the Airborne Infections Research Facility in Emalahleni, South Africa, were asked to wear surgical masks during the day, excluding mealtimes; infectiousness of air from the ward was reduced after the intervention 53 Manipulation of clinic schedules to reduce risk of transmission to susceptible individuals in waiting rooms At the Indus Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, before the establishment of a separate tuberculosis clinic, clinic schedules were arranged so that no paediatric clinics were run on days during which patients with tuberculosis were seen (personal experience of FA).
 In various hospital spaces in Lima, Peru, the amount of ventilation was nearly 20 times higher when windows and doors were opened than when they were closed. With open windows and doors, these spaces were better ventilated than spaces with mechanical ventilation systems (eg, fan-based systems) 54 In the future, rapid biomarker-based tests that do not rely on detection of bacteria in sputum could improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis, particularly in children and people with HIV. Technologies under development at present include antigen detection tests and tests to analyse volatile organic compounds in breath or urine. 58 Failure to suspect or identify drug resistance at the time of tuberculosis diagnosis can result in patients receiving inadequate treatment regimens, which prolongs both illness and infectiousness and potentially causes amplifi cation of drug resistance. 59, 60 Patients can deteriorate and remain infectious for months in places where policies allow treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis to be considered only after a patient has been unsuccessfully treated with a fi rst-line regimen. Therefore, use of new molecular diagnostic tests to rapidly diagnose drug resistance and presumptive treat ment for drug-resistant tuberculosis are both integral to stopping transmission of drug-resistant strains. Molecular diagnostic tests can detect drug resistance in hours or days rather than the weeks needed for conventional culture-based drug susceptibility testing. In settings with high prevalence of drug resistance, such as Russia, Peru, and various southern African settings, universal drug susceptibility testing using molecular tests has been shown to be feasible, reducing the time to diagnosis of drug resistance and initiation of second-line treatment. 51, 61, 62 In settings with low rates of drug resistance in the general tuberculosis patient population, rapid molecular testing of people suspected of having tuberculosis or patients meeting certain criteria for being at an increased risk of drug resistance (eg, contacts of an individual with drug-resistant tuberculosis, individuals with a history of tuberculosis treatment, patients not responding to treatment, and refugees) has proven to be a feasible intermediate step toward universal drug susceptibility testing.
 Standardised risk criteria can also be used to identify individuals who should receive treatment for drugresistant disease, even in the absence of a drug susceptibility test result. For example, high concordance of drug susceptibility test pattern has generally been reported between the index case and secondary cases within households of patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis. 63 Therefore, presumptive treatment for drug-resistant disease is warranted for household members of patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis who are themselves diagnosed with tuberculosis, especially young children who are most likely to not have bacteriological confi rmation and be infected with the same strain as the index patient.
 Even a perfect diagnostic technology or algorithm cannot have an eff ect on transmission if patients are not rapidly started on treatment. Thus, not only is the method of diagnosis important to consider, but also the timeliness and ease with which patients receive diagnostic results and are linked to care. High rates of failure to initiate treatment after diagnosis have been reported in a range of settings. 64 Sometimes, gaps in the health-care delivery system can lead to a failure to communicate test results or an absence of action based on these results. 65, 66 In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, only 20% of patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis had started tuberculosis treatment within 2 weeks of testing using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, which yields results within hours. 67 In other situations, patients themselves might decline treatment despite receiving a diagnosis of tuberculosis, particularly if they have no or mild symptoms or if treatment interferes with their ability to work. Nearly a quarter of patients diagnosed with sputum smear-positive tuberculosis during a community survey in India did not initiate treatment, with the two most common reasons being lack of interest in treatment and having symptoms too mild to warrant treatment. 68 Therefore, strategies are needed to ensure that all individuals diagnosed with tuberculosis are informed of their diagnoses, counselled appropriately, and promptly treated. Strategies could include the collection of accurate contact information during the initial diagnostic encounter, optimisation of diagnostic procedures and communication systems to reduce time to diagnosis and treatment, active follow-up of people who do not initiate treatment, incentives for initiation of treatment, and oversight and support for individuals requiring it during treatment. In some countries, regulations exist that allow a tuberculosis programme to compel a patient to accept treatment despite his or her refusal; the decision about how to balance the rights of a patient with the public health system's mandate to protect the public is complex and warrants careful consideration. 69
 A health-care system that requires patients to seek or receive tuberculosis care within specifi c tuberculosisfocused settings or programmes might result in patients spending substantial time and eff ort accessing tuberculosis care, in addition to their other health-care needs. This burden can discourage patients from either seeking or remaining in care. Thus, a system that makes it easier for patients to access tuberculosis services in conjunction with other health-care services would probably improve both case detection and the probability of treatment initiation and completion.
 Many logical points of integration between tuberculosis services and other health-care services exist. The FAST strategy off ers one example of a way to integrate tuberculosis screening into primary care settings. Additionally, integration of tuberculosis and HIV services by use of a range of approaches is widely advocated, and is an obvious area for improvement in many countries with high burdens of both diseases. Maternal-child health programmes (including Integrated Management of Childhood Illness screening programmes and malnutrition clinics) provide a platform to off er tuberculosis treatment or preventive therapy to young children. 70 Other important points of contact include clinics treating patients with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or lung disorders associated with smoking, all of which are associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis. [71] [72] [73] [74] Achievement of this sort of coordination of care will require tuberculosis programmes to partner with other stakeholders in the general health services rather than working in isolation.
 Partnerships outside the public health-care sector can also improve the eff ectiveness of many of the strategies discussed thus far. For example, engagement of community members who advocate for best practices, encourage health-care-seeking behaviours, and support patients through treatment can help ensure that interventions initiated by the tuberculosis programme have wide-reaching and sustained eff ect. Additionally, partnerships with other government sectors, such as those in charge of prisons or social welfare programmes, can ease access to vulnerable or hard-to-reach populations. Finally, partnerships with the private sector are necessary in settings such as south Asia, where 80% of patients seek care from private providers. 75 In view of the large number and the heterogeneity of private providers, it is an immense undertaking for national tuberculosis programmes to eff ectively engage these providers to ensure that patients with tuberculosis receive timely diagnoses and appropriate treatment, and that all tuberculosis cases are reported to the national tuberculosis programme even if they are diagnosed and treated in the private sector. Although strategies will vary across settings, some approaches that have proven successful include use of large private hospitals with associated clinic networks as reporting centres for the national tuberculosis programme; use of mobile phone-based platforms to help report screening or diagnostic results from private facilities; and mass media campaigns that give publicity to private facilities that have partnered with the national programme to off er testing and treatment. 29, 75 Projection of impact What impact would be expected from a commitment to identify and treat more people with tuberculosis than is achieved at present? Models consistent with the present tuberculosis epidemics in China, India, and South Africa predict that an increase in case detection by 25% can achieve a 40-44% reduction in tuberculosis-associated mortality, a 22-27% reduction in incidence, and a 30-33% reduction in prevalence in 10 years (fi gure). 76 Furthermore, these interventions were deemed to be highly cost eff ective, even if the costs of the interventions were as high as US$2500 per case detected in India, and $5000 per case detected in China and South Africa. Importantly, these projections show that the populationlevel benefi ts of active case-fi nding accumulate with time since removal of infectious cases from the population prevents the development of additional cases in both the near-term and long-term future; thus an assessment at the end of 1 year is unlikely to show a substantial eff ect, even though the 10 year projected benefi t is substantial. These projections assume that detection is synonymous with prompt and eff ective treatment, so all case-fi nding has to be directly linked to the immediate delivery of care.
 Achievement of a 25% increase in case detection is feasible in view of the strategies already discussed. Of 19 active case-fi nding initiatives, each lasting 1 year, undertaken in 11 countries, the median increase in notifi cation rates of sputum smear-positive tuberculosis Figure: Projected impact of sustained active case-fi nding after 10 years in China, India, and South Africa 76 Impact represents reduction after 10 years compared with baseline, assuming an active case-fi nding programme that detects and treats 25% more cases than would otherwise be detected and treated in view of present epidemiological trends in each country. The additional cases detected are assumed to come from a homogeneous population, with detection occurring at a random point of disease progression. Figure cases was 35%, after controlling for historical trends in case notifi cation rates and changes in case notifi cation rates in control populations that did not receive the interventions. 20 In one of these initiatives, undertaken in Karachi, Pakistan, a combination of screening outpatients in clinics and a mass communication campaign encouraging people with prolonged cough to seek care more than doubled the case notifi cation rate in the intervention area compared with the control area. 29 A model consistent with local tuberculosis epidemiological data projected that if the level of case detection achieved during the intervention year were maintained, 24% of the tuberculosis cases and 52% of the tuberculosis deaths that would have occurred in the absence of the intervention would be averted in 5 years; even if the level of case detection were to fall back to baseline immediately after the intervention year, 13% of cases and 25% of deaths would be averted. 77
 Stopping an epidemic requires stopping transmission. For an airborne disease without an eff ective vaccine, stopping transmission requires fi nding all cases promptly and rendering them non-infectious through treatment.
 The only way to accomplish this is to search actively for cases, use eff ective diagnostic methods and algorithms, initiate patients promptly on the correct therapy, and support them through to cure. The knowledge necessary to do these activities exists and successes have been documented across a range of settings. While major changes to existing policies and care delivery systems will take time, action in the near future is possible. Some administrative and environmental interventions, such as providing individuals suspected of having tuberculosis with surgical masks until treatment begins and, where practical, opening windows in health facilities, can be implemented immediately without changes to existing systems or large investment of resources. Others, such as performing basic household contact investigations, implementation of the FAST strategy, and expansion of the use of molecular diagnostics, will require some additional human resources, training, and capacity building, but can be rapidly accomplished within the context of existing health-care delivery systems. Still others, such as integration of health-care services, have a slightly longer timeframe because they require the development of partnerships and the reorganisation of existing systems. The development and deployment of new point-of-care diagnostic technologies could accelerate these eff orts by making diagnosis easier in the future.
 By applying existing knowledge comprehensively and exhaustively, we can stop the production of new tuberculosis infections and cases and make a substantial impact on the epidemic. These eff orts would certainly be aided and enhanced by the development of new diagnostic tests, vaccines, and treatments. However, with suffi cient commitment of resources, engagement with stakeholders outside national tuberculosis programmes, and careful planning to ensure that all the components of a new comprehensive strategy are coordinated, tuberculosis rates can be substantially reduced.

As of Jan 25, 2020, the scale and geographical extent of the 2019-nCoV outbreak both within and outside mainland China are highly uncertain. We used this outbreak size estimate to project the number of cases that have been exported to other Chinese cities. 32 On Jan 19, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that only 43 (22%) of the 198 confirmed cases in its outbreak investigation had been exposed to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, 33 the most probable index source of zoonotic 2019-nCoV infections, which was closed and disinfected on Jan 1, 2020. For the sensitivity analysis, we assumed 129 and 172 cases (50% and 100% higher than the baseline scenario value). Given that both 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV could cause self-sustaining human-tohuman transmission in the community, we assumed that the serial interval of 2019-nCoV was the same as that of SARS-CoV in Hong Kong (mean 8·4 days; table 1). force of infection equal to 86 cases per day in the baseline scenario before market closure on Jan 1, 2020, and equal to 0 thereafter.

We estimated that if there was no reduction in trans missibility, the Wuhan epidemic would peak around April, 2020, and local epidemics across cities in mainland China would lag by 1-2 weeks. If transmissibility was reduced by 25% in all cities domestically, then both the growth rate and magnitude of local epidemics would be substantially reduced; the epidemic peak would be delayed by about 1 month and its magnitude reduced by about 50%.

We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar fi ndings obtained for prepandemic SARS.
 Methods We retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confi rmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notifi ed in the previous 2 weeks. To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS. We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data.
 Results
 procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient. Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R 0 would exceed 1-ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential.
 Interpretation Our analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential. We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.","Since September, 2012, WHO has been notifi ed of 64 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. 1 This new disease has many features reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-eg, predominance of respiratory symptoms, airborne transmission, high case-fatality ratio, and caused by a virus of the Betacoronavirus genus that is closely related to bat coronaviruses. [2] [3] [4] [5] The SARS-CoV pandemic had been preceded by outbreaks in southeast China between November, 2002, and January, 2003. 6, 7 During this period, the virus is thought to have been repeatedly introduced into human populations from its intermediate hosts (eg, the masked palm civet) before adapting to interhuman transmission. 8, 9 The molecular events leading to the mutation that enabled the SARS-CoV spike protein to bind with the human ACE2 receptor have been particularly well described. 10 The same sequence of events might be occurring with MERS-CoV, which has been repeatedly introduced into the human population for more than a year (from an unknown animal host) and might have human pandemic potential. One useful indicator of virus transmissibility is the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which represents the number of secondary cases per index case in a fully susceptible population. When R 0 is above 1, epidemic potential has been reached. We aimed to adapt a recently published method of estimating R 0 11 to the MERS-CoV outbreaks and compare the results with similar fi ndings obtained for prepandemic SARS.
 We retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters and clinical disease progression from various sources, including the WHO summary 1 and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases in the UK, 4 Jordan, 12 France, 13 and Saudi Arabia. 14, 15 As of June 21, 2013, 64 laboratoryconfi rmed MERS-CoV cases have been reported.
 The earliest two confi rmed cases appeared in a cluster of 13 individuals with respiratory symptoms in a hospital in Zarqa, Jordan, in April, 2012. Diagnosis was done retrospectively, by analysis of samples from these patients; two patients, those who died, tested positive for MERS-CoV. 12 Since then, other cases have occurred in and outside the Middle East (fi gure 1). 19 of these cases were regarded as sporadic, including three cases in individuals who were admitted to hospital in the UK and Germany. 15 reported cases were grouped into six small clusters of two to four cases, including four clusters in which interhuman transmission occurred outside the Middle East (UK, France, Tunisia, and Italy). In May, 2013, a large cluster of 23 confi rmed cases was reported in the Al-Hasa governorate, Saudi Arabia. An unrelated cluster of fi ve cases was later reported in the neighbouring city of Dammam, Saudi Arabia.
 We obtained data on prepandemic SARS clusters in the Guangdong province of China from the scientifi c literature. 7 Between November, 2002, and January, 2003, seven clusters of one, two, three, fi ve, seven, eight, and nine cases, each having one index patient, were reported.
 Our data analysis is based on the concept of transmission tree, defi ned as all cases related to one index patient. By contrast, the concept of cluster is based on temporal and geographical grouping and might include one or more transmission trees, depending on the number of index patients belonging to the cluster.
 For the branching process analysis, we assumed that all MERS-CoV introductions into the human population occurred in the Middle East. We took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confi rmed cases. We excluded the nine cases notifi ed in the 2 weeks preceding June 21, 2013, because the incubation period of MERS-CoV could be up to 14 days, so these cases might belong to current transmission clusters. 16 For improved modelling consistency, we also took into account seven probable cases: (1) one case, a patient who travelled from Saudi Arabia to Tunisia where two of his children, who had subsequent contact with him, tested positive; (2) the fourth case of the family cluster detected in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in October, 2012 (a patient aged 16 years who was symptomatic but was not tested for MERS-CoV); 14 (3) cases A and C, reported as probable in the investigation of the Al-Hasa cluster; 15 and (4) three cases in the Jordanian cluster. The large number of unconfi rmed cases (11 of 13) in the Jordanian cluster called for caution. On the basis of a 38% case-fatality ratio in individuals younger than 60 years (see summary statistics in the Results section), and considering that the patients with the two confi rmed cases in the Jordanian cluster died, we estimated that the expected cluster size could be 2/0·38, which is roughly 5. Hence, we considered three additionally probable cases next to the two confi rmed ones in the Jordanian cluster. We also did a sensitivity analysis of our results, varying the size of the Jordanian cluster between two and 13 (appendix).
 The partition of clusters into transmission trees is often ambiguous when the data are insuffi cient. We dealt with this limitation in several ways. First, we used published epidemiological investigations of MERS-CoV See Online for appendix clusters (ie, the Jordanian, 12 UK, 4 French, 13 Al-Hasa, 15 and Riyadh 14 clusters) to provide information about their tree structure. Second, we regarded the MERS-CoV clusters detected outside the Middle East as trees generated by the patient travelling outside the Middle East. Third, we made assumptions on the occurrence of transmission events on the basis of epidemiological links between cases to investigate the clusters that remained otherwise unresolved. We regarded cases as epidemiologically linked if the patients were either close family members or had documented contact and, furthermore, if the dates of onset were separated by the minimum incubation period (ie, 2 days 15 ). Hence, we did not consider infectious ness outside the symptomatic period, since no data support it at present, and all transmission data available so far are compatible with transmission during the symptomatic phase. 15 This feature was also true for SARS-CoV. 2 We investigated two diff erent scenarios for partitioning the remaining clusters. Our fi rst scenario assumes a large number of index patients per cluster, each generating a small tree, which results in a high introduction rate of the virus into the human population and a moderate transmissibility. The two cluster par tition ing rules of the fi rst scenario are that a report of an epidemiological link between two infected individuals certifi es that trans mission occurred between these individuals, and that all unlinked individuals are sporadic cases. However, we note that two epidemio logically linked cases might have become infected after common MERS-CoV exposure. Hence, the fi rst rule is a modelling choice that can be refi ned as further data become available. According to scenario 1, we regarded two Saudi Arabian clusters of two and four cases (the cluster of four cases located in Riyadh 14 ) as single trees since they consisted of family members. The cluster of fi ve reported in Dammam was partitioned into three sporadic cases and one tree of two cases, since two of the patients shared a hospital room. We split the Jordanian cluster into three sporadic cases and a tree of two cases (patient 3 and his brother, patient 8). 12 Our second scenario assumes a small number of large trees, which results in a low introduction rate and raised transmissibility of the virus. In this case, we grouped the individuals in one cluster to obtain the maximum tree sizes compatible with the epidemiological investigations. Hence, in the second scenario the Dammam and Jordanian clusters were regarded as transmission trees each containing fi ve cases. The distribution of tree sizes obtained for both scenarios is given in the table.
 We analysed MERS-CoV transmission using the theory of homogeneous branching processes. The key element of this theory is the distribution of the number of cases caused by an infected individual. Its average, the basic reproduction number of the pathogen infection R 0 , has a fundamental role in the transmission dynamics. If R 0 is less than 1, then all transmission trees terminateotherwise transmission trees might be infi nite and the disease becomes an epidemic. Assuming a Poisson distribution of the number of secondary cases, we inferred the R 0 of MERS-CoV using Bayesian analysis (appendix). We also did two sensitivity analyses of our R 0 results. First, we varied the size of the Jordanian cluster between two (the number of confi rmed cases) and 13 (the total number of confi rmed and probable cases). Second, we investigated the consequences of the outstanding event of six secondary cases caused by patient C of the Al-Hasa cluster in the dialysis ward (appendix).
 We calculated the rate of MERS-CoV introductions into the human population from the estimated number of index patients during the period of data collection (table) . We assigned corresponding CIs on the assumption that introduction events follow Poisson statistics (appendix).

 Overall, patients with confi rmed MERS-CoV were aged between 2 and 94 years (median 56 years, IQR 41-68·5) and most were men ( We obtained an R 0 of 0·60 (95% CI 0·42-0·80) for scenario 1 and 0·69 (0·50-0·92) for scenario 2. The number of transmission trees for each scenario provided the number of MERS-CoV introductions into the human population during the period of data acquisition. Hence, we obtained yearly introduction rates of 22·3 (95% CI 13·0-31·5) and 17·1 (9·0-25·3) for scenario 1 and 2, respectively. We also obtained an R 0 of 0·80 (0·54-1·13) for prepandemic SARS. Repeating the analyses assuming the size of the Jordanian cluster to be between two and 13 or excluding the outstanding event of six secondary cases caused by patient C of the Al-Hasa cluster in the dialysis ward 15 showed the robustness of our results (appendix). As shown in fi gure 2A, the average tree size is very sensitive to the value of R 0 , particularly when R 0 is close to 1. We further studied the expected yearly incidence of MERS-CoV infections, calculated by multiplying the intro duction rate into the human population by the average tree size, 1 / (1 -R 0 ). 11 Figure 2B shows a contour map of the yearly incidence versus the introduction rate and R 0 . Non-linear dependence qualifi es R 0 as the key parameter, particularly for values close to 1. On the same fi gure 2B, we plotted the parameters corresponding to our scenarios 1 and 2 and showed the region in the parameter space most likely to include the true parameters of MERS-CoV. This plot suggests that the possibility of MERS-CoV having an R 0 above 1 or less than 0·4, or a yearly introduction rate above 35, is very small. To assess the potential eff ect of future MERS-CoV outbreaks on our R 0 estimation, we analysed the change in the probability that R 0 exceeds 1 versus the tree size that would be observed next (fi gure 2C). In scenario 2, a tree larger than 98 cases would imply that the probability of having a pandemic MERS-CoV strain exceeds 5%. In scenario 1, reaching the 5% threshold would need the next observed tree to consist of 200 cases.
 When active contact tracing is operational, public health authorities might immediately stop viral transmission after the index patient has been diagnosed, and thus the available data would be just the number of secondary cases of the index patient before their isolation. This situation is addressed in fi gure 2D in which, in scenario 2, the 5% probability threshold is reached if the The average tree size versus R 0 as predicted by the theory of homogeneous branching processes. The dark blue and red dashed lines correspond to the values of R 0 that we calculated for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. (B) Contour plot of the expected Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) yearly incidence versus introduction rate into the human population and R 0 . The very dark blue region corresponds to yearly incidence estimates below 10. The dark red region corresponds to yearly incidence estimates above 320. All other solid colour regions correspond to yearly incidence estimates bounded by the values shown on the contours. The black square and red circle show the parameter sets of scenarios 1 and 2, respectively; the error bars represent the corresponding 95% CIs. As a visual aid, we have shaded the region comprising the parameter sets compatible with scenarios 1, 2, and the in-between area compatible with intermediate scenarios.

R 0 =basic reproduction number (the number of secondary cases per index case in a fully susceptible population). next index patient caused eight secondary cases. In scenario 1, the 5% threshold is reached if the next index patient caused 14 secondary cases.
 Our analysis suggests that MERS-CoV has not reached epidemic potential-ie, R 0 was less than 1. Although R 0 estimates of prepandemic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV under our second scenario are close, we cannot conclude that MERS-CoV will follow a similar path toward pandemic spread. Despite phylogenetic similarities, the two viruses have distinct biology, such as the use of diff erent human receptors. 10,17 SARS-CoV adaptation to human beings took just several months, whereas MERS-CoV has already been circulating for more than a year in human populations without mutating into a pandemic form. However, the speed of adaptation depends on several variables, some of which might widely diff er between China and the Middle East (eg, animal and human density, baseline preventive measures, and, most importantly, the prepandemic R 0 ). 18 Because of the very small number of MERS-CoV sequences available, nonsynonymous mutations suggesting viral adaptation could not be yet established. Hence, comparison between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV should remain cautious. Figure 2B displays the yearly number of cases as a function of two variables, the yearly introduction rate and R 0 . Control of this new zoonosis could therefore be exercised by addressing these two components.
 First, control could target a reduction in the rate of MERS-CoV introductions into the human population. However, the animal host responsible for MERS-CoV introductions is not yet known. This search should take high priority, focus on Middle Eastern countries where most cases occurred, and address the broad variety of species known to host coronaviruses, including bats, birds, mice, dogs, pigs, and cattle. 19 Reports have already pointed to sick goats and camels in the vicinity of patients as a potential source of MERS-CoV. 20, 21 Second, control could focus on a reduction in the infectious period of infected individuals through improved surveillance, rapid diagnosis, and isolation. When done eff ectively, active contact tracing could reduce the number of cases to the number of MERS-CoV introductions (ie, index patients) and the secondary cases they might cause before isolation. 22 We note that R 0 might also increase with the population density and is aff ected by the community age and contact structure. Large gathering events or travel of patients from the Middle East to densely populated areas might result in outbreaks with increased R 0 .
 Our analysis depends on the quality of the surveillance systems. 23 In view of the tendency for identifi cation of large clusters at the beginning of an epidemic, and insuffi cient data for partitioning clusters into smaller transmission trees, our tree-size data analysis might overestimate R 0 . Hence, this bias would not aff ect our conclusion that MERS-CoV does not have pandemic potential and is likely to be minimised now that public health surveillance systems are on alert. Also, timely control measures after diagnosis of a new patient will trim the natural pattern of transmission. Still, the virus will always have a short window of opportunity for transmission before the isolation of each new index patient. For this reason, we considered the situation in which the next available datapoint would be the count of cases secondary to the index patient, and provided a method that might be useful in places with eff ective surveillance.
 Another important issue is the possibility of asymptomatic and mild infections. A confi rmed case with mild symptoms, for which admission to hospital was not needed, occurred in the UK. 4 If asymptomatic and mild infections constituted an important fraction of the total, R 0 might be higher than our estimate. In the future, serological analysis of contacts will allow a fair estimation of asymptomatic infections. Serological tests for MERS-CoV are under development, but have not yet been deployed. Retrospective analysis of sera of contacts of SARS-CoV patients showed a very small (0·2%) proportion of asymptomatic infections. 24 Of note, serum samples of 2400 control patients at the Dr Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where the fi rst patient was diagnosed, did not detect MERS-CoV in an immunofl uorescence assay that was strongly positive with the serum of the patient, suggesting that MERS-CoV was not circulating undetected in the general population during the previous 2 years. 3 The main issue for now is how to interpret the data on the size of future outbreaks that surveillance systems will detect. Most certainly, future data will add to our knowledge about viral transmissibility and narrow the CIs around the R 0 estimate. Our analysis suggests that if eff ective contact tracing detected eight or more secondary cases caused by the next index patient, then,
 Systematic review A PubMed search on June 23, 2013, with the terms ""HCoV-EMC"", ""MERS-CoV"", and ""novel human coronavirus"" identifi ed 24, 14, and 46 reports, respectively, linked to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. 18 reports contained detailed epidemiological information about MERS-CoV cases, starting with the Sept 27, 2012, description of two cases by Danielsson and colleagues. 25 Articles relevant to our paper are cited in the text.
 Our report provides the fi rst estimation of the basic reproduction number R 0 for MERS-CoV, with evidence that the virus has not yet reached pandemic potential. Enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal host and transmission route to human beings should be urgently prioritised.
 under scenario 2, this would suggest, together with all knowledge gathered so far, that there is a more than 5% chance that the MERS-CoV R 0 is larger than 1-ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential. This fi nding seems unlikely because the largest count of secondary cases attributed to a patient is seven (six in a dialysis ward and one outside) and is an outlier.
 In conclusion, our analysis confi rms the importance of enhanced surveillance of MERS-CoV infection and an active search for its animal host, particularly in the Middle East where MERS-CoV infection is most prevalent (panel). Close monitoring of cases and contact tracing are of high priority to limit transmission, gather highquality data to update the R 0 estimates, and decrease opportunities for viral adaptation to interhuman transmission. One of the main lessons of the SARS pandemic has been that early control of the virus (while it was still confi ned to southeast China) might have prevented its global spread.

Patients 1 and 2 stayed in one room and patients 3-6 stayed in another room. Relatives 2-5 have developed fever, cough, and weak ness since Jan 4, 2020. Patients 1 and 3 had visited relative 1, aged 1 year, and the son of relative 2, on Dec 29, 2019, in a Wuhan hospital, who had been treated in hospital for febrile pneumonia (relative 2 accompanied relative 1 in the hospital over night; relative 1 later recovered and was discharged home on Dec 31, 2019). The incubation period was estimated to be between 3 and 6 days. The blood tests and CT scan of patient 6 were normal. She was given cefaclor for 3 days with no improvement. Except for patient 4, all six had normal or lower than average total white blood cell counts. Only the serum sample of patient 2 was positive and all other patients' serum, urine, and faecal samples were negative for this novel coronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis of the PCR products showed that the amplicon sequences of both RdRp and S genes from these five patients were novel (figure 3) and different from other known human or animal coronaviruses, including the SARS and bat SARS-related coronaviruses. Two complete virus genomes (HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b) were sequenced using Nanopore technology and showed a novel coronavirus that is most closely related to those of the bat SARS-like coronavirus bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (NCBI accession number MG772934) and bat-SL-CoVZC45 (NCBI accession number MG772933). All six patients were admitted to hospital under isolation, supportive care, and remained stable as of Jan 20, 2020. Several possible scenarios of transmission exist. The second scenario is that patients 1-5 have directly acquired the infection from relatives 2-5 and transmitted it to patient 7 on returning to Shenzhen. The attack rate is rather high, up to 83% if we included the five patients (patients 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) with unexplained ground-glass radiological changes of the lungs on CT scan as the case definition in this family outbreak after visiting Wuhan. 17 Notably, patients 3 and 4 were afebrile at presentation to our hospital. These cryptic cases of walking pneumonia might serve as a possible source to propagate the outbreak. The three oldest patients in this family with comorbidities had more severe systemic symptoms of generalised weakness and dry cough. The multifocal ground-glass changes on lung CT scan were typical of viral pneumonia. Their lung involvement was also more diffuse and extensive than those of the younger patients, whose blood test results were largely normal. Interestingly, the two younger adults (patients 3 and 4) initially had diarrhoea, which was also reported in 10·6% (15 of 142) of our SARS patients at presentation; 18 however, the subsequent faecal samples of patients 3 and 4 that were collected 9-10 days after symptom onset were negative for the virus after the diarrhoea had long subsided. 20 Diarrhoea and gastrointestinal involvement are well known in coronavirus infections of animals and humans.

However, substantial changes in Chinese society have been followed by a resurgent epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases. Sporadic reports have provided clues to the magnitude of the spread of syphilis, but a national surveillance eff ort is needed to provide data for planning and intervention.
 Methods We collected and assessed case report data from China's national sexually transmitted disease surveillance system and sentinel site network.
 Findings In 1993, the reported total rate of cases of syphilis in China was 0·2 cases per 100 000, whereas primary and secondary syphilis alone represented 5·7 cases per 100 000 persons in 2005. The rate of congenital syphilis increased greatly with an average yearly rise of 71·9%, from 0·01 cases per 100 000 livebirths in 1991 to 19·68 cases per 100 000 livebirths in 2005.
 The results suggest that a range of unique biological and social forces are driving the spread of syphilis in China. A national campaign for detection and treatment of syphilis, and a credible prevention strategy, are urgently needed.","Syphilis is a very serious infection that causes acute cutaneous manifestations including genital ulcers, chronic severe and debilitating compromise of the cardiovascular and nervous systems, and serious eff ects on reproductive and neonatal health. 1 During pregnancy, syphilis infection can lead to spontaneous abortion, congenital deformities, and severe neonatal disease.
 Syphilis was fi rst recognised in mainland China in 1505. 2 By the time the Communist party assumed power in 1949, the Chinese people were suff ering one of the biggest syphilis epidemics in human history. Surveillance studies in the 1950s showed that the infection was present in as many as 84% of prostitutes and 5% of the general population in some large cities, and 2-3% of rural residents. 3, 4 Mao Zedong and his government prioritised health care, and the control of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD) was one of their key aims. 4 In 1952, China developed an unprecedented and unique campaign to eliminate STD. The government instituted mass screening, provided free treatment to infected individuals, and closed brothels. 5, 6 This programme seemed to be highly eff ective, and studies by Chinese and international teams verifi ed the virtual eradication of STDs by the 1960s. [7] [8] [9] [10] However, long-term control of STD in China has proved elusive. Economic and social reforms designed to open China to the world have been successful, but also appear to have laid the foundation for the reemergence of STD. Increased personal wealth, greater geographical mobility, and more relaxed government control 11 set the stage for the spread of STD. The fi rst cases of syphilis in China after the death of Mao were reported in 1979. 12 These changes led to the establishment of the Chinese National Center for STD Control in 1986, followed by the launch of a national STD surveillance system by the Ministry of Health in 1987. The purpose of this report is to describe the growth and magnitude of the Chinese syphilis epidemic on the basis of Chinese governmental surveillance data.
 Surveillance of STD is done through mandatory casereporting from government facilities including STD clinics, designated provincial dermatovenereology centres, gynaecology and genitourinary clinics, maternity and children's hospitals, and other health providers in all 31 provinces, municipalities, and auto nomous regions of the country. Beginning in 2005, syphilis case-reporting moved from paper reports to electronic online submission.
 For each syphilis case, doctors or their assistants fi lled out a standardised STD reporting card with demographic (age in 10 year intervals, sex, home location, marital status, occupation, and education), clinical (diagnostic evidence, onset of symptoms, stage of syphilis, presence of other STD), and epidemiological information (route of acquisition). According to national guidelines, 13 primary syphilis was defi ned as a clinically compatible case characterised by one or more chancres and inguinal lymphadenopathy, and laboratory confi rmation of Treponema pallidum in clinical specimens by dark-fi eld microscopy or reactive non-treponemal rapid plasma reagin, or toluidine red unheated serum test and treponemal T pallidum haemagglutination, or particle agglutination assay for antibody to T pallidum; secondary syphilis was defi ned as a clinically compatible case characterised by maculopapular rash and, in many cases, lymphadenopathy, and laboratory test confi rmation as for primary syphilis; latent syphilis was defi ned as an asymptomatic case with a possible history of infection supported by two consecutive reactive non-treponemal tests (rapid plasma reagin), a reactive treponemal test (particle agglutination assay), and normal cerebrospinal fl uid; and tertiary syphilis was defi ned as a case with a history of primary, secondary, or latent syphilis with clinical manifestations involving the cardiovascular or central nervous system and laboratory confi rmation with reactive non-treponemal tests, or cerebrospinal fl uid abnormalities characterised by higher than normal amounts of white blood cells or protein. A case of congenital syphilis was defi ned as a neonate or child younger than 2 years aff ected by associated signs and symptoms such as rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy, with an infected mother, supported by detection of T pallidum in lesions by dark-fi eld microscopy or reactive serological test. 14 To increase the accuracy with which STD incidence could be assessed, a network of 16 sentinel surveillance sites was established in 1987 in areas with high rates of STD. This network was subsequently expanded in 1993 to 26 sites in various cities throughout China. A map of these sentinel sites is shown in fi gure 1. Each site has a designated organisational centre from either the dermatovenereology institute or Center for Disease Control hospital networks that coordinates mandated STD reporting from all STD service providers in their jurisdiction, which is in most places a city district or in some an entire city. These sites have strengthened manage ment, standardised diagnosis and treatment protocols, and established laboratory quality assurance measures, for STD surveillance. By comparing the number of STD diagnoses recorded in clinic and laboratory registries at sentinel sites with case reports in the surveillance system, twice-yearly quality control studies indicate that sentinel sites report all but less than 5% of newly diagnosed STD cases.
 Information from sentinel and non-sentinel sites is collected at the county level and reported quarterly to the next administrative levels until it reaches the National Center for STD Control, where all compiled surveillance data are stored in an electronic database (fi gure 2).
 EpiInfo (Version 1.1, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) was used to analyse the results in this study. Total syphilis incidence refers to the number of new syphilis cases at any stage per 100 000 people per year. Because reports based on classifi cation of syphilis into primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary syphilis were not introduced into surveillance reports until 1996, incidence data before this year refer to total syphilis incidence.
 The reported incidence of congenital syphilis was calculated by dividing the number of new congenital syphilis cases by the number of livebirths in a specifi ed year. National population and livebirth data were obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. 15 The average yearly rate of increase in incidence was calculated as a geometric mean by use of the formula: (incidence at time n divided by incidence at time 1)^(1/[n-1])-1, where n is defi ned by the interval number of years.
 The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and the team of coauthors had fi nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
 Nationwide surveillance data indicated that after remaining just below 0·2 cases per 100 000 people from 1989 to 1993, the total incidence of syphilis increased from 0·17 cases per 100 000 in 1993 to 6·5 cases per 100 000 in 1999, with incidence of primary and secondary syphilis accounting for 5·85 cases per 100 000 (fi gure 3). After decreasing slightly between 2000 and 2003 (perhaps more a result of administrative changes during that time than a real decline), the incidence of primary and secondary syphilis has increased in the past 2 years to 5·67 cases per 100 000 people. The average incidence of primary and secondary syphilis for the years 2000 to 2005 was 5·13 cases per 100 000 people per year. Incidence of congenital syphilis had grown at a very rapid rate with an average yearly increase of 71·9%, from 0·01 cases per 100 000 livebirths in 1991 to 19·68 cases per 100 000 livebirths in 2005 (fi gure 3). The actual numbers of cases of syphilis classifi ed by the stage of disease are shown in table 1.
 More than 70% of reported cases of syphilis in the past 10 years were in people aged 20-49 years. The mean ages were slightly higher in northern and central China than in other regions of the country (table 2). The ratio of male to female individuals with syphilis decreased from 2·0 to 1·0 between 1988 and 2000, and has held steady for the past 5 years.
 All China's 2882 counties reported cases of syphilis during the past 5 years. In 2005, the highest rates of total syphilis cases were reported in Shanghai (55·3 cases per 100 000 individuals), Zhejiang (35·9 per 100 000), and Fujian (26·8 per 100 000), which together with Jiangsu (13·0 per 100 000) form China's prosperous southeastern seaboard. Beijing municipality had the next highest rate (24·9 per 100 000), followed by the southern Zhujiang River Delta (Guangxi, Guangdong, and Hainan provinces), which reported rates of about 14-21 cases per 1 9 8 9 1 9 9 0 1 9 9 1 1 9 9 2 1 9 9 3 1 9 9 4 1 9 9 5 1 9 9 6 1 9 9 7 1 9 9 8 1 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 Reported incidence of primary and secondary syphilis cases Reported incidence of congenital syphilis cases

Thus, before 1996, data points for primary and secondary syphilis show incidence for total syphilis. However, an ad hoc survey of syphilis reports in 38 cities from 1990 to 1994 suggested that reported cases of primary, secondary, early latent, tertiary, and congenital syphilis accounted for 20·2%, 46·5%, 28·1%, 2·1%, and 0·7% of total cases, respectively. 
 Our report provides a comprehensive view of the reemergence of syphilis in China. These fi ndings are consistent with reports of the exceptional prevalence of syphilis in high-risk groups in China [16] [17] [18] and of the spread of other STD in China, 19 including a nationwide cross-sectional survey that showed a high prevalence of chlamydial infection, especially in urban coastal areas. 20 Worldwide, resurgence of syphilis in China corresponds to epidemics reported in several cities in the UK, 21 Ireland, 22 the Russian Federation states, 23 and the USA. 24 The incidence of primary and secondary syphilis in 2005 (5·67 cases per 100 000) was substantially higher than that in most developed countries; for example, the USA reported 2·7 cases of primary and secondary syphilis per 100 000 individuals in 2004. 24 Furthermore, the number of cases cited might not accurately refl ect the true extent of the epidemic. STDs treated at hospitals, family planning centres, gynaecological clinics, pharmacies, and private practitioners go largely un reported, 25, 26 although these venues represent important access points for patients with STDs. A study in Shenzhen and Guangzhou 27 showed that 27% of patients with STDs sought initial care at a site other than a government dermatovenereology centre; in Chengdu 28 and Hangzhou, 29 18-40% of patients sought care from private doctors and pharmacists. In an internal, unpublished quality-control study done in 1999, STD surveillance offi cials found that in one province, more than 75% of STD cases were not reported. Private practitioners were the least reliable, reporting only 0·2% of cases, followed by district-level hospitals (7·9%), provincial-level hospitals (15·4%), and city-level hospitals (35·5%).
 Surveillance reporting might also be limited by the availability of governmental resources. The 26 sentinel sites reported about 18% of the nation's aggregate syphilis cases, although these sites cover only 3% of the population. Such results suggest that non-sentinel sites are probably not reporting the actual scale of the epidemic, and that improved surveillance would yield a higher overall incidence than reported here.
 As an alternative approach we did a systematic review of published work, 17 which suggested the following prevalences of syphilis in specifi ed populations: antenatal women 0·45%; premarital testing 0·66%; voluntary blood donors 0·37%; migrant workers 1·4%; remunerated blood donors 2·86%; possible female sex workers 0·83%; incarcerated female sex workers 12·49%; drug users 6·81%; and men who have sex with men 14·6%. 17 In the past 5-10 years, syphilis rates seem to have increased in all these groups, with the greatest increase in drug users (0·96% per year), incarcerated female sex workers (1·41% per year), and men who have sex with men (4·50% per year). 17 Surveillance data and focused reports from throughout China provide compelling evidence of a substantial and worsening syphilis epidemic in individuals at high risk, and in the general population. Syphilis can have devastating health consequences, especially if untreated. 1 The increasing privatisation of health care in China has left many people without resources to seek care, particularly for problems like syphilis that on the surface appear to be self-limiting. In a 2004 survey, half the respondents from three provinces reported foregoing health care in the previous year because of its prohibitive cost. 30 This proportion is probably much higher in rural areas, as shown by results from one study done in a rural county outside Beijing where 80% of women with symptoms of STD did not seek health care because of its high cost and their own lack of knowledge about STD. 31 Obviously, any defects caused by congenital syphilis would be devastating. Additionally, syphilis can contribute to the spread of HIV infection by raising the viral burden in HIV-infected individuals 32 and by increasing susceptibility to infection. 33 Cotransmission of syphilis and HIV has been reported in Pune, India, 34 and syphilis infection in pregnant women might facilitate the vertical transmission of HIV. 35 Although the gravity of syphilis during pregnancy cannot be overstated, detection and treatment of the disease could be overshadowed by focus on the prevention of vertical HIV transmission. 36 The rapid spread of syphilis in China is probably attributable to a combination of biological and social forces. Grassly and co-workers 37 have argued that the Reported incidence of total syphilis from sentinel sites Reported incidence of total syphilis from nationwide STD surveillance system Incidence (per 100 000) extent of syphilis observed in a population most closely indicates the degree of herd immunity. In their analysis of changes in syphilis incidence in the USA over the past 50 years, they concluded that 10-year cycles of disease resurgence could result from depletion of individuals with immunity resulting from natural infection. 37 In view of the virtual absence of syphilis in China for 20 years, the general population of young, sexually active individuals would be completely susceptible to this infection. Social forces could be of even greater importance. Although prostitution in China has an extensive history, 38 strict governmental intervention restricted such practices for nearly 40 years. 6, 38 However, economic reforms (so obvious in China's growth and globalisation) have led to income gaps and a cultural climate that favours reemergence of sex work. 11 A substantial majority of men and a huge migrant population of male workers have created an increasing demand for sex work. 39 It is not a surprise that a high prevalence of syphilis in sex workers has been well documented. 16 Sexual practices are also changing. Young Chinese people are increasingly likely to experiment with sex at earlier ages and before marriage. 40 Additionally, reduced governmental emphasis on public-health services, increasing costs of individual health care, and reduced availability of health insurance 41 might have contributed to reduced recognition and treatment of syphilis.
 Clearly, China must attack the spread of STD and especially syphilis. One key component of this intervention is aff ordable syphilis screening, the tool that proved so powerful in the earliest days of Mao's government. 6 The southern city of Shenzhen has pio neered free syphilis screening for all pregnant women, a programme that has been shown to be cost eff ective and sustainable. 42 Further eff orts should also be directed at groups in which high syphilis prevalence has been documented, such as men who have sex with men 43 and female sex workers. 44 Thousands of health centres in China already off er free voluntary counselling and testing for HIV, and additional testing for syphilis in these centres would expand coverage of syphilis screening and help to integrate STD and HIV prevention eff orts. However, these strategies will need much support from local and national leaders, as part of the overall urban and rural health reforms. 45 STD prevention programmes need to be scaled-up for a mass audience. Preliminary results from the 100% condom use programmes for sex workers promoted in Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, and Hainan provinces are favourable, with sharp drops in the prevalence of syphilis in female sex workers. 46 These targeted interventions have been complemented by mass education campaigns directed at younger people.
 China has recently shown a great interest in the control of infectious diseases. Although the country was perhaps slow to recognise the threat of HIV, this infection is now a key governmental focus for which many active programmes are being developed, including needle exchange and methadone schemes for intravenous drug users, and free medical care for those who are infected with HIV. The resources put into place to control severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 47 and avian infl uenza 48 are also impressive.
 The spread of syphilis in China has been insidious, and has only recently attracted the attention it deserves. Initial eff orts to respond to this epidemic include the pilot screening and prevention programmes and national consultative meetings in 2005 and 2006 that have generated a response strategy and helped to place syphilis on the national agenda. China has shown once before that the control of syphilis is possible, 9 and we expect that a new national campaign, although challenging, will show benefi t.

Driven in large part by concerns over cost, this strategy prioritises treatment success among passively detected cases and considers case detection to be of secondary importance. 12 Improvement of case detection by actively searching for sick individuals is only the fi rst step in stopping transmission. Furthermore, although cases that are detectable by sputum smear microscopy are generally more infectious than those that are not, the nondetectable cases have been shown to cause 13-17% of transmission in low-incidence settings. Thus, with adequate resource investment and political will, substantial decreases in tuberculosis incidence are possible. Once a tuberculosis case is identifi ed, further transmission from that individual can be stopped almost immediately by initiation of eff ective treatment. In a com munityrandomised trial in Brazil, eight com munities matched according to socioeconomic indicators were assigned to either an intervention or control condition. Although optimum methods for both can vary across settings, general strategies that have proven eff ective in a range of settings can provide a starting point for implementation. 20 Thus, each tuberculosis programme has to identify what combination of targeted active case-fi nding activities is the most eff ective in the local context. One high-risk group that is present in all settings is contacts of patients with tuberculosis. 20 Material incentives can also be useful in encouraging people to undergo screening; two randomised controlled trials in the USA reported that small monetary incentives doubled the proportion of homeless people who returned to the clinic to have their tuberculin skin tests read. 48 Another practical consideration is what screening and diagnostic algorithm to use. 1 Screening people with HIV for tuberculosis is therefore a crucial strategy for tuberculosis case detection. In Russia, about 0·5% of the population is incarcerated. However, prisoners accounted for 27% of tuberculosis cases in 1995. 43 Since then, Russia has focused on addressing tuberculosis in prisons, enforcing both mandatory screening and directly observed treatment. Facilities where individuals who are sick spend hours waiting for health care in crowded and poorly ventilated waiting areas can promote transmission within the facility. Detection of these cases as soon as possible is thus crucial to prevent transmission. 7 For tuberculosis, the strategy ""Finding TB cases Actively, Separating safely, and Treating eff ectively"" (FAST) has helped facilities introduce procedures that reduce the risk and duration of exposure to tuberculosis for both patients and health-care workers. 52 Additionally, a range of administrative and environmental interventions can further augment eff orts to prevent transmission within facilities, without substantial additional resource investment (table 3) . 51 In a tuberculosis hospital in Voronezh, Russia, implementation of FAST using a molecular diagnostic test reduced the time from admission to initiation of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment to less than 5 days, compared with the weeks that patients would wait to receive results from mycobacterial culture and conventional drug susceptibility testing. With open windows and doors, these spaces were better ventilated than spaces with mechanical ventilation systems (eg, fan-based systems) 54 In the future, rapid biomarker-based tests that do not rely on detection of bacteria in sputum could improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis, particularly in children and people with HIV. 59, 60 Patients can deteriorate and remain infectious for months in places where policies allow treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis to be considered only after a patient has been unsuccessfully treated with a fi rst-line regimen. Therefore, use of new molecular diagnostic tests to rapidly diagnose drug resistance and presumptive treat ment for drug-resistant tuberculosis are both integral to stopping transmission of drug-resistant strains. Molecular diagnostic tests can detect drug resistance in hours or days rather than the weeks needed for conventional culture-based drug susceptibility testing. In settings with high prevalence of drug resistance, such as Russia, Peru, and various southern African settings, universal drug susceptibility testing using molecular tests has been shown to be feasible, reducing the time to diagnosis of drug resistance and initiation of second-line treatment. Thus, not only is the method of diagnosis important to consider, but also the timeliness and ease with which patients receive diagnostic results and are linked to care. 69
 A health-care system that requires patients to seek or receive tuberculosis care within specifi c tuberculosisfocused settings or programmes might result in patients spending substantial time and eff ort accessing tuberculosis care, in addition to their other health-care needs. 70 Other important points of contact include clinics treating patients with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or lung disorders associated with smoking, all of which are associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis. [ 71] [72] [73] [74] Achievement of this sort of coordination of care will require tuberculosis programmes to partner with other stakeholders in the general health services rather than working in isolation. Partnerships outside the public health-care sector can also improve the eff ectiveness of many of the strategies discussed thus far. Importantly, these projections show that the populationlevel benefi ts of active case-fi nding accumulate with time since removal of infectious cases from the population prevents the development of additional cases in both the near-term and long-term future; thus an assessment at the end of 1 year is unlikely to show a substantial eff ect, even though the 10 year projected benefi t is substantial. The only way to accomplish this is to search actively for cases, use eff ective diagnostic methods and algorithms, initiate patients promptly on the correct therapy, and support them through to cure. While major changes to existing policies and care delivery systems will take time, action in the near future is possible. Still others, such as integration of health-care services, have a slightly longer timeframe because they require the development of partnerships and the reorganisation of existing systems. The development and deployment of new point-of-care diagnostic technologies could accelerate these eff orts by making diagnosis easier in the future. These eff orts would certainly be aided and enhanced by the development of new diagnostic tests, vaccines, and treatments. CMY, SK, and MCB conceived the idea for this Series paper.

Intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters, and nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV continue to occur. Between April 2012 and December 2019, 2499 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 858 deaths (34·3% mortality) were reported from 27 countries to WHO, the majority of which were reported by Saudi Arabia (2106 cases, 780 deaths). Large outbreaks of human-to-human transmission have occurred, the largest in Riyadh and Jeddah in 2014 and in South Korea in 2015. MERS-CoV remains a high-threat pathogen identified by WHO as a priority pathogen because it causes severe disease that has a high mortality rate, epidemic potential, and no medical countermeasures. This Seminar provides an update on the current knowledge and perspectives on MERS epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, management, infection control, development of new therapeutics and vaccines, and highlights unanswered questions and priorities for research, improved management, and prevention.","During the past 17 years three lethal zoonotic diseases of humans caused by novel coronaviruses, severe acute repiratory syndrome (SARS) in November, 2002, 1 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in April, 2012, 2 and more recently coronavirus disease in December, 2019. 3 All three causative coronaviruses, respectively, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) have focused the attention of global public health authorities and are listed in the WHO Blueprint list for priority pathogens 4 because of their pandemic potential, threat to global health security, and the absence of any effective treatments.
 SARS-CoV was first identified in humans in Guangdong, China, in November, 2002 and subsequently spread rapidly worldwide to 29 countries, resulting in 8098 human SARS cases with 774 deaths (9·6% mortality). 1, 5 The SARS epidemic ended abruptly in July, 2003, 1 and no human cases of SARS have been detected over the past 15 years. MERS-CoV was first identified as causing human disease when it was isolated from a lung sample of an adult patient who was admitted at a hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with severe pneumonia and died of multiorgan failure. 6 A retrospective study then linked MERS-CoV to a hospital outbreak in April, 2012, in Jordan. 7 MERS-CoV is considered a zoonotic pathogen, with MERS-CoV-infected dromedary camels being the animal source of infection to humans. 8, 9 Unlike SARS-CoV, which was contained within a year of emerging, MERS-CoV continues to circulate and cause human disease with intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters, and nosocomial outbreaks in the Middle East with considerable risk of spreading globally. 2,10 Several outbreaks of human-to-human MERS-CoV trans mission have occurred, the largest outside the Middle East occurring in South Korea in 2015. 11, 12 This outbreak was associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, as well as having substantial economic, social, and health security effects. 12 SARS-CoV-2 (initially named 2019-nCoV) was detected in December 2019 after sequencing of clinical samples from a cluster of patients in Wuhan, China who dev -eloped pneumonia of unknown cause. 13 This outbreak is rapidly evolving and as of March 3, 2020 there have been 88 948 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 3043 deaths (3·4% mortality). Outside China, there have been 8774 cases reported from 64 countries with 128 deaths. 3 This Seminar reviews current knowledge and provides an update on MERS-CoV epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, management, infection control, and development of new therapeutics and vaccines, and also highlights unanswered questions and priorities for research, improved management, and prevention.
 MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, are members of the Coronaviridae family of the order Nidovirales. Other human coronaviruses generally cause mild respiratory infections (eg, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1). MERS-CoV, like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, can cause highly lethal disease in humans. MERS-CoV is a large single-strand positive-sense RNA virus (figure 1). [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] The 30-31 kb coronavirus genome encodes a large number of proteins, which might confer versa tility in adapting to new environments and enhance cross-species transmission. MERS-CoV has four struc tural proteins: spike (S) protein, envelope (E)protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The S protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein located as a trimer on the virus surface and consists of S1 and S2 subunits. It has crucial roles in binding, fusion, and entry into host cells.
 The S1 subunit has a receptor binding domain that binds to the host cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). The S2 subunit has two regions, heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2), which rearrange to form a six-helix bundle to enable membrane fusion. The E and M proteins are present in the viral membranes and are required for viral assembly, budding, and intracellular trafficking. MERS-CoV enters host cells via binding of its S protein to the host cell DPP4 receptor (figure 1; appendix pp 2-3). 15, 17 DPP4 is less abundant in the nasal cavity and epithelial cells of the upper airways but is highly expressed on the epithelial cells of the distal airways and type I and II pneumocytes in the lung alveoli, non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and some haemopoietic cells. 15 DPP4 is also widely expressed on the epithelial cells of several other organs and tissues such as the kidneys, intestine, liver, thymus, and bone marrow-thus widespread dissemination of MERS-CoV could occur in the body. The structures of the S protein of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses have been deter mined using cryoelectron microscopy 16, 17 and provide the basis for rational design of protective antibodies and other therapeutics.
 A primary MERS-CoV infection is defined by WHO as a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection that has no direct epidemiological link to a human MERS-CoV infection, and was acquired outside of a health-care facility presumably from direct or indirect contact with the reservoir host-dromedary camels. 19 A secondary MERS-CoV infection is defined by WHO as a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection with a direct epidemiological link to an individual with confirmed or probable MERS-CoV infection. 19
 Laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV human infections 19 
 The origin of all primary human MERS-CoV infections remains unknown. Dromedary camels are a host reservoir species for the MERS-CoV (appendix pp [3] [4] [5] . [20] [21] [22] [23] Humans can acquire MERS-CoV through direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels or infected patients [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] (figure 4A) . However not all cases infected in the community report contact with dromedary camels (appendix p 4-5). The transmission of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans is now well documented in the Arabian Peninsula, [23] [24] [25] but the extent to which this transmission is occurring in countries outside the Arabian Peninsula requires definition. Experimental infections have shown that infected dromedaries shed MERS-CoV from their nasal secretions with minimal signs of illness, which is limited to rhinorrhoea. [27] [28] [29] Full-genome phylogenetic analysis indicates that evolution of diverse MERS-CoV lineages in camels have caused human infections, perpetuating a low barrier for interspecies transmission. 21, 29, 30 However, African MERS-CoV lineages in camels imported into Saudi Arabia have not established themselves in camels in Saudi Arabia, 9, 30 indicating potential differences in transmission dynamics and selection pressure. Analysis of population dynamics shows that Arabian viruses can maintain endemicity without introduction of additional lineages. 9,30 WHO is supporting molecular and serological studies at the dromedary-human interface in several countries in Africa and south Asia. 31 The phylogenetic relationship of complete genomes of MERS-CoV strains obtained from camels and humans has been published. 32 See Online for appendix ) and accessory proteins (ORFs 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 8b) are encoded in the end third of the 3' end of the genome of the genome. MERS-CoV binds to its cellular receptor DPP4 via the S protein, which is processed by host proteases to expose a fusion peptide. The viral genome is then released into the cytoplasm, where it is translated on host ribosomes into rep1A and rep1B proteins. The polyprotein is cleaved by two viral-encoded proteases, encoded by nsp3 and nsp5. Proteins involved in genome and subgenome replication and transcription include nsp12 (the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRP]) and two associated proteins, nsp7 and nsp8. 127 Nsp13 (a helicase), nsp14 (which encodes an N7 methyltransferase and ExoN, a protein required for genome fidelity), and nsp16 (a 2'-O methyltransferase) are also necessary for optimal genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis. MERS-CoV transcription involves the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs, which encode the structural and accessory proteins located at the 3' end of the genome. Subgenomic and genomic RNAs are co-terminal, sharing the same 5' leader and 3' sequences. Subgenomic RNAs code for structural and accessory proteins (ORF3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b). ORF8b is encoded within the N gene (marked with purple lines). These accessory proteins are believed to have immunoevasive properties, but are not essential for replication, and are variably deleted in human and camel virus isolates. [128] [129] [130] Genomic replication occurs on membrane structures such as double membrane vesicles (DMVs), convoluted membranes (CM), and vesicle packets (VP), which are merged DMV 131 that have been formed from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) by the combined action of nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 (lower right). After synthesis on replicase-transcription complexes, RNA is encapsidated by the N protein and transported to the ERGIC (endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi compartment), where budding into membranes containing the S, E, and M proteins occurs before release from the cell. 3CLPro=chymotrypsin-like protease.

 The epidemiological patterns of MERS-CoV in humans have remained consistent since MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012. 2 Primary cases often report direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels and present across a wide clinical spectrum from mild to severe fulminant disease. Individuals with severe primary MERS-CoV infections are often older than 65 years with comorbidities, and symptoms can present late. Individuals with mild primary MERS-CoV infections are often missed by current surveillance systems since they usually do not present to health-care facilities.
 Secondary cases have resulted from human-to-human transmission among close contacts. To date, secondary transmission has occasionally occurred between close contacts of individuals with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV in household settings. 33, 34 However, secondary transmission in health-care facilities has repeatedly occurred in several countries and has, on occasion, resulted in large outbreaks (appendix p 5)-such as 39 Transmission via contact with contaminated hospital environments is possible during outbreaks, although genomic studies providing an evidence base are lacking. Since environmental contamination is a potential source of infection, it is prudent to take precautionary infection control measures.
 Health-care-associated outbreaks of MERS-CoV affecting inpatients, health-care workers, and visitors are characteristic of MERS (panel 2) and account for approximately 50% of reported cases. 2 
 The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV remain to be defined because autopsies are generally not done either for religious and cultural reasons or to prevent environmental contamination with subsequent infection of health-care workers. Therefore, there are few data on the histopathological changes in patients with MERS-CoV infection, even in severe disease. 46, 47 The only two autopsies available show that viral infection was confined predominantly to the respiratory tract, although viral particles were detected in the kidney in one of the reports. 47 Further, ex vivo human kidney cultures were shown to support productive MERS-CoV infection. 48 However, it is not known whether infection of this organ contributes to worse outcomes compared with infections confined to the respiratory tract. Viral RNA, but not infectious MERS-CoV, was detected in the blood for at least 2 weeks after diagnosis.
 Whether this viral RNA represented an extrapulmonary infection is not clear, since MERS-CoV neutralising antibody was detected in the serum at the same time in some patients. 49 Pathological changes in the lungs include evidence of focal haemorrhagic necrotising pneumonia with exudative diffuse alveolar damage, indistinguishable from findings detected in severe pneumonia caused by other viral agents.
 Several experimentally infected animal models for MERS have been developed (appendix p 6). 50, 51 Methods for gene silencing and editing are being further developed, therefore it is likely that additional viral and host factors important in MERS-CoV pathogenesis will be identified.
 MERS-CoV pathogenesis reflects a balance between coronavirus-induced protective and pathogenic host immune responses and direct cytotoxic effects of the virus. 52 According to studies of patients infected with SARS-CoV and of mice and other animals infected experimentally with MERS-CoV, successful resolution of MERS and long-term protection from re-infection likely requires well coordinated innate and adaptive B-cell and T-cell responses. In patients with SARS, innate immune responses characterised by an extended period of cytokine secretion (eg, IFNα and IFNβ) was correlated with delayed antibody responses and poor management outcomes; this prolonged innate response has not yet been shown in patients infected with MERS-CoV. 53 MERS-CoV productively infects activated human T cells and induces delayed cytokine responses after infection of human myeloid cells in vitro, both of which could impair virus clearance and the development of an effective immune response. [54] [55] [56] During the acute phase of MERS, robust virus-specific CD8 T-cell responses were detected in most patients with severe or moderate disease, with antibody and CD4 T-cell responses appearing later in the disease course. 57 T-cell and antibody responses were reliably detected 2-3 weeks after diagnosis, although they were detected earlier in some patients. 49, 57 Studies of MERS survivors showed that MERS-CoV-specific antibody responses tended to be lower and transient in patients with mild or subclinical disease when compared with patients with severe disease, in whom MERS-CoV-specific antibody responses were detected for at least 2 years. [57] [58] [59] [60] In contrast, T-cell responses were detected in all MERS survivors for at least 2 years. 59 The transitory nature of the antibody response in mild disease and greater stability of the T-cell response suggest that induction of both will be required for optimal longterm protection; the measurement of both will enhance the accuracy of prevalence studies.
 The specific exposures that lead to sporadic MERS-CoV infections are unknown, therefore it is impossible to estimate the incubation period in primary cases. However, based on data from cases of human-to-human transmission, the incubation period is a median of 5-7 days, with a range of 2-14 days (median 5·2 days [95% CI 1·9-14·7]). 2,10,21,61-63 Immunocompromised patients can present with longer incubation periods of up to 20 days. 64
 The clinical presentation of patients infected with MERS-CoV ranges from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory illness to rapidly progressive pneumonitis, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multiorgan failure with fatal outcome (figure 5). 2,10,11,61-70 It is not possible to distinguish patients with a legitimate asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection from those who develop mild disease because reports to WHO provide signs and symptoms information only at the time of reporting. Many individuals remain asymptomatic whereas some go on to develop mild disease, which is why WHO classifies these individuals as mild or asymptomatic. Asymptomatic-to-mild infection rates of 25-50% have been reported.
 The signs and symptoms associated with MERS are non-specific, with or without multisystem involvement, and thus could be mistaken for other causes of respira tory tract or gastrointestinal illnesses. 2,10,11,61-70 Therefore, the clinical diagnosis of MERS can be easily missed. Patients with MERS can typically present with fever, chills, rigors, headache, a non-productive cough, sore throat, arthralgia, and myalgia followed by dyspnoea. Other associated symptoms include coryza, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sputum production, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain. Some patients with MERS can present with atypical symptoms of mild respiratory illness without a fever and a gastrointestinal illness that precedes the develop ment of pneumonia. 64,67,68 Neuromuscular manifestations include hypersomnolence, weakness, and tingling in the extremities similar to Guillain-Barré syndrome or virusrelated sensory neuropathy. 68 Co-infection of MERS-CoV with other respiratory viruses (such as parainfluenza The pathogen: MERS-CoV • Anti-viral therapeutics including host-directed therapies or immune-based therapies are in development.

MERs-CoV=Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. virus, rhinovirus, influenza A or B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses, and human meta pneu movirus) and nosocomial bacterial infections has been reported in patients receiving intensive care. 61, 67 Immunocompromised patients or those with comorbidities
 Immunocompromised patients or patients with chronic heart, liver, and kidney disease can present with atypical features, such as a longer incubation period, a longer period from initial PCR positivity to symptom onset, persistent prolonged viral shedding, and increased mortality. [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] MERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people older than 60 years, and those with chronic comorbid diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, immunosuppression, and diabetes.
 In children yonger than 5 years, MERS-CoV infection appears to be rare, and usually presents as mild disease with cough as the predominant clinical symptom. Acute and severe respiratory illness (ie, a fatal outcome after multiorgan failure) has been noted in only two of 38 reported paediatric cases and these were in boys aged 9 months and 2 years with comorbidities (infantile nephrotic syndrome and cystic fibrosis, respectively). [71] [72] [73] [74] Data on the prevalence of MERS-CoV in pregnant women are limited to case reports, and the clinical presentations and mortality rates are similar to nonpregnant women. 75 MERS should be kept on the differential diagnosis list for ill travellers returning home from MERS-CoV endemic areas who present with acute febrile illness (temperature ≥38°C), aches and pains, headache, cough, dyspnoea, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, unexplained leucopenia (white blood cell count <3·5 × 110⁹/L), and thrombocytopenia (platelets <150 × 10⁹/L)-either with or without prominent respiratory symptoms. 2, 10, 11, [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] It is important that clinicians are alert to the possibility that patients could have MERS in all health-care settings where the virus is circulating so that an accurate diagnosis can be made and infection control measures implemented efficiently. 76
 The type and quality of the clinical specimen are important in the laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection. Both upper respiratory tract specimens (oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs) and lower respiratory tract specimens (sputum, endotracheal aspirate or lavage) should be analysed whenever possible. [77] [78] [79] Patients with MERS might not shed the virus during the early stage of their illness; thus, initial negative results from upper respiratory samples do not rule out the possibility of MERS and patients should be retested using a lower respiratory tract sample. Several studies of MERS-CoV viral load measurements show that upper respiratory tract specimens have lower viral loads than lower respiratory specimens. 11, 12, 79, 80 MERS-CoV RNA has been detected in blood, urine, and stool-but at much lower viral loads than in the respiratory tract. 81, 82 Clinical specimens must be collected by trained staff using appropriate personal protective equipmenteg, when taking nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens, Dacron or rayon swabs specifically designed for collecting specimens for virology must be used. 77, 78, 83 These swab kits should contain virus transport medium. A single negative test result does not exclude the diagnosis and repeat sampling and testing is strongly recommended. 83 A minimum of two samples, preferably from the lower respiratory tract, are needed to exclude MERS-CoV after initial assessment. To confirm clearance of the virus, respiratory samples should be collected sequentially (every 2 to 4 days) over ensuing days until there are two consecutive negative results at least 24 h apart in people who are clinically recovered. 77
 WHO guidelines for testing should be followed. 77 MERS-CoV testing must be performed in appropriately equipped biosafety laboratories by staff trained in the relevant technical and safety procedures. National or WHO guidelines on the laboratory biosafety should be followed in all circumstances. 83 Three real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays for routine detection of MERS-CoV have been developed targeting upstream of the E protein gene (upE) and open reading frame (ORF)1b and ORF1a. The assay for the upE target is considered highly sensitive and is recommended for screening, with the ORF1a assay (ORF1a assay is considered more sensitive than ORF1b assay). 77 An updated roadmap for MERS-CoV product development lists all available diagnostics and other diagnostics in the developmental phase. 84 Several diagnostic tests are under development to accelerate turnaround times from sample analysis to result. [85] [86] [87] A 2018 rapid and specific assay for the detection of MERS-CoV combines the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification technique and a vertical flow visualisation strip (RT-LAMP-VF) to detect the nucleocapsid gene of MERS-CoV. 86 The RT-LAMP-VF assay provides detection of MERS-CoV within 35 min and is easier to perform than the WHO-recommended rRT-PCR method. 86 Several serological assays are available for detection of MERS-CoV: ELISA, recombinant spike immunofluorescent assay, and spike pseudoparticle neutralisation and microneutralisation assay. [87] [88] [89] [90] A case confirmed by serology requires evidence of seroconversion in two samples, ideally taken at least 14 days apart, by a screening (eg, ELISA, immunofluorescence assay) and a neutralisation assay. 77, 78 Imaging A range of abnormal but non-specific chest x-ray findings are seen in patients with MERS. 91, 92 These abnormal ities include unilateral or bilateral bronchovascular shadowing, interstitial infiltrates, reticular opacities, reticulonodular shadowing, nodules, pleural effusions, and patchy to confluent consolidation (appendix pp [18] [19] . Lower lobes tend to be affected more than upper lobes early in the course of MERS and rapid opacification of lungs and progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur.
 High-resolution CT might show ground glass opacities (figure 5B) in early CT findings (with or without consolidation) followed by interlobular septal and intralobular interstitial thickening with peripheral and lower lobe involvement 93, 94 within the first week of MERS-CoV infection. During subsequent weeks, a so-called crazy-paving lung abnormality, cavitation, tree-in-bud pattern and centrilobular nodules, constrictive obliterative bronchiolitis, bronchiolitis obliterans, peribronchiolar air-trapping, thickened peripheral bronchioles, and organising pneumonia have been observed. 95
 Currently, there are no specific anti-MERS-CoV therapies available for human use. The mainstay of clinical management of MERS cases is mostly symptom focused, providing supportive care 10,61 with pain and fever management, treating concomitant or secondary bacterial infections, and supporting vital organ functions. Mild MERS cases can be managed at home. 96 Predictive factors for development of pneumonia include older age (>56 years), high fever, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, C-reactive protein greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL, and a high viral load in sputum (threshold cycle value of rRT-PCR <28·5). 10, 70 Respiratory failure and acute kidney injury (with haematuria and proteinuria) are common among patients admitted for hospital care because of the severity of their disease and who require mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and dialyses. 10, 61, 70 Several empirical treatments have been studied in severely ill patients. Therapies used for severely ill patients with MERS have included convalescent plasma, corticosteroids, antiviral agents (eg, interferons and ribavirin), and protease inhibitors, or combination of members from these groups. A systematic review of 30 publications on therapeutic agents used for MERS treatment in various outbreaks showed a complete absence of an accurate evidence base and emphasised the need for controlled trials. 97
 Several agents have shown inhibitory effects against MERS-CoV in cell cultures, including interferons, ribavirin, ciclosporin, and mycophenolic acid. [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] Empirical lopinavir-ritonavir, pegylated interferon alfa-2a, and ribavirin have been used for serious cases, but no efficacy data are yet available. There is an ongoing randomised clinical trial in progress in Saudi Arabia (the MIRACLE trial; NCT02845843) comparing lopinavir-ritonavir, recombinant interferon beta, and standard supportive care against placebo and standard supportive care in patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS requiring hospital admission. This recursive, multicentre, placebocontrolled, double-blind, randomised controlled trial is designed to include two components, each consisting of two stages. The first two-stage component is designed to adjust sample size and determine futility stopping, but not efficacy stopping (n=34). The second two-stage component is designed to determine efficacy stopping and possibly readjustment of sample size.
 The use of plasma from patients with MERS who have made a full recovery (convalescent plasma) requires clinical trial evaluation. Preclinical animal data show that transfer of serum samples from MERS-CoVimmune camels to infected mice resulted in reduced weight loss and lung histo pathology, 106 thus suggesting therapeutic potential. In the 2015 Korean outbreak, three of 13 patients with MERS with respiratory failure were given four infusions of convalescent plasma. 107 Two of three showed neutralising activity. Donor plasma with a plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) titre of 1/80 had a meaningful serological response after convalescent plasma infusion, while that with a PRNT titre of 1/40 did not. The authors conclude that for effective convalescent plasma infusion in patients with MERS, donor plasma with a neutralisation activity of a PRNT titre greater than or equal to 1/80 should be used.
 Antibiotic therapy is commonly started empirically in seriously ill patients. A retrospective study of 136 patients with MERS found that macrolide therapy resulted in no reduction in mortality or faster MERS-CoV RNA clearance compared with those who were not treated with macrolides. 108
 For serious cases, hospital inpatient care is required to reduce the risk of complications such as organ failure and secondary infections. Non-invasive ventilation is associated with a high failure rate (92%) in patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to MERS-CoV infection. 109 Patients with severe symptoms might need to be managed in an intensive care unit, where lungprotective ventilatory strategies for acute respiratory distress syndrome, inotropic support, antimicrobial therapy for co-infections, and renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure can be provided.
 Studies show no benefit from the use of systemic corticosteroids. Systemic corticosteroids were shown to delay viral clearance in critically ill patients with MERS-CoV infection. 100
 A range of potential treatments are under consideration, development, or evaluation (panel 3). A phase 1, first-inhuman, single site, randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of single ascending doses of a co-administered monoclonal antibodies REGN3048 and REGN3051 administered intravenously in healthy adult volunteers (NCT03301090) is ongoing and study duration will be approximately 16 months. Another study is comparing patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support with those who did not receive ECMO support (NCT02627378). Several monoclonal and polyclonal neutralising antibody products, including novel chimeric camel or human heavychain antibodies, are protective in animal models, [110] [111] [112] and their potential use for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis in outbreak management requires evaluations in controlled trials.
 In a mental health study, 7·6% of 1656 patients who were quarantined showed symptoms of anxiety, and 6·4% reported feelings of anger during the 2 weeks of quar antine. 113 Mental health support, accurate information, and appropriate supplies, including food, clothes, and accommodation, should be provided to people who feel isolated.
 Several studies have reported disease severity and mortality risk factor data from patients in the Middle East and South Korea. 11, 12, 21, [114] [115] [116] [117] Ahmed and colleagues collected the daily information on MERS-CoV cases posted online by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health between Dec 2, 2014, and Nov 12, 2016, and reviewed 660 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS. 114 They showed mortality at day 3 (13·8%), day 30 (28·3%), and overall (29·8%). Patients older than 60 years were more likely to die (45·2% mortality) from their infections than were younger patients (20%).
 Several factors are associated with severe disease and high mortality rates in patients with MERS. These factors include male sex, comorbid pre-existing illnesses (such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, cancer, chronic heart, lung, and kidney disease, and immunocompromised states), low serum albumin, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, concomitant infections, and positive plasma MERS-CoV RNA. DPP4 receptors are upregulated in the lungs of smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which might explain why patients with comorbid lung diseases are prone to severe illness. 118 In the 2015 Korean outbreak, the case-fatality rate was 20·4% (39 of 186 patients died), the in-hospital mortality was 19·4% (36 of 186 patients), 7-day mortality (from symptom onset) was 3·8% (seven of 186), and 28-day mortality was 17·7% (33 of 186). 11, 12 Host factors associated with mortality in this outbreak were older age (>60 years), smoking history, pre-existing pneumonia, abnormal renal function, and comorbidity. Low albumin, altered mentality, and high pneumonia severity index score at admission were risk factors for mortality.
 In a study of long-term effects after recovery from MERS, 119 patients with severe illness who were admitted to intensive care reported higher limitations in some measure of their quality of life than patients with less severe illness who were managed in medical wards. The long-term consequences of MERS illness on survivors appear to be similar to those caused by other viral causes of severe acute respiratory infections such as influenza, parainfluenza, and metapneumovirus. 120 Follow-up imaging studies of patients who recover from MERS indicate that lung fibrosis might develop in a substantial number of patients. 95
 The prevention of transmission of MERS-CoV in the community and in health-care settings is crucial to preventing outbreaks and further spread. Several substantive reviews and WHO guidelines are available on the subject. 21, 61, 76, 96 It is important to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene, and to implement stringent contact and droplet precautions among health-care workers. To prevent community transmission, contact tracing, quarantine or isolation of close contacts, and public education are important measures. 20, 60 In hospitals, early case detection followed by isolation is essential, ideally in negative pressure isolation rooms. The main infection prevention and control measures for managing patients with MERS are well documented from the SARS epidemic and from experiences from managing MERS outbreaks (appendix pp 7-8).
 Advances in technology, vaccine platforms, clinical trial designs, and bioinformatics are supporting MERS-CoV vaccine development (appendix [8] [9] . WHO target product profiles for MERS-CoV vaccines calls for the development of three types of MERS vaccines: a human vaccine for long-term protection of people at high exposure risk, such as health-care workers and those working with potentially infected camels; a human vaccine for reactive use in outbreak settings; and a dromedary camel vaccine to prevent zoonotic trans mission. 121 Multiple types of vaccine candidates are in development including inactivated whole virus, live attenuated virus, viral vectored vaccines, subunit vaccines, and DNA vaccines. 121, 122 Most vaccines use the S protein or the domain of the S protein required for binding to host DPP4 as an immunogen, since neutralising antibodies are mostly directed to the receptor binding domain.
 WHO, Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, and World Organization for Animal Health, in consultation with global MERS community, identified knowledge gaps and priorities for MERS research, surveillance, management, and control (panel 4). 31 Several recent publications have highlighted the importance of a one-human-environmental-animal-health (One Health) approach to tackle and control the spread of MERS-CoV (appendix p 9). 31, [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] Conclusion MERS-CoV is a pathogen with epidemic potential that continues to cause sporadic human disease and remains on the WHO Blueprint 2020 priority list. 4 Given that MERS-CoV appears to be highly endemic among dromedary camels from geographically widespread areas of the Middle East and Africa, zoonotic transmission with consequent risk of human epidemics will most likely continue for years to come. 8, 9 MERS-CoV endemic and at-risk countries must invest more in surveillance, in public health research, and in medical interventionsincluding human and camel vaccine development. The continued risk of human MERS-CoV outbreaks 7 years after its first discovery, effective human and camel MERS-CoV vaccines appear to be the ideal way to prevent continuing spread of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels in the Middle East and in humans at high risk of acquiring community and nosocomial MERS-CoV infection.

The earliest two confi rmed cases appeared in a cluster of 13 individuals with respiratory symptoms in a hospital in Zarqa, Jordan, in April, 2012. We took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confi rmed cases. On the basis of a 38% case-fatality ratio in individuals younger than 60 years (see summary statistics in the Results section), and considering that the patients with the two confi rmed cases in the Jordanian cluster died, we estimated that the expected cluster size could be 2/0·38, which is roughly 5. The partition of clusters into transmission trees is often ambiguous when the data are insuffi cient. We dealt with this limitation in several ways. Second, we regarded the MERS-CoV clusters detected outside the Middle East as trees generated by the patient travelling outside the Middle East. Third, we made assumptions on the occurrence of transmission events on the basis of epidemiological links between cases to investigate the clusters that remained otherwise unresolved. We split the Jordanian cluster into three sporadic cases and a tree of two cases (patient 3 and his brother, patient 8). The distribution of tree sizes obtained for both scenarios is given in the table. Its average, the basic reproduction number of the pathogen infection R 0 , has a fundamental role in the transmission dynamics. We calculated the rate of MERS-CoV introductions into the human population from the estimated number of index patients during the period of data collection (table) . We assigned corresponding CIs on the assumption that introduction events follow Poisson statistics (appendix). The sponsors of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had fi nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Hence, we obtained yearly introduction rates of 22·3 (95% CI 13·0-31·5) and 17·1 (9·0-25·3) for scenario 1 and 2, respectively. 11 Figure 2B shows a contour map of the yearly incidence versus the introduction rate and R 0 . Non-linear dependence qualifi es R 0 as the key parameter, particularly for values close to 1. To assess the potential eff ect of future MERS-CoV outbreaks on our R 0 estimation, we analysed the change in the probability that R 0 exceeds 1 versus the tree size that would be observed next (fi gure 2C). The very dark blue region corresponds to yearly incidence estimates below 10. R 0 =basic reproduction number (the number of secondary cases per index case in a fully susceptible population). next index patient caused eight secondary cases. In scenario 1, the 5% threshold is reached if the next index patient caused 14 secondary cases. Control of this new zoonosis could therefore be exercised by addressing these two components. This search should take high priority, focus on Middle Eastern countries where most cases occurred, and address the broad variety of species known to host coronaviruses, including bats, birds, mice, dogs, pigs, and cattle. In the future, serological analysis of contacts will allow a fair estimation of asymptomatic infections. Serological tests for MERS-CoV are under development, but have not yet been deployed. 24 Of note, serum samples of 2400 control patients at the Dr Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where the fi rst patient was diagnosed, did not detect MERS-CoV in an immunofl uorescence assay that was strongly positive with the serum of the patient, suggesting that MERS-CoV was not circulating undetected in the general population during the previous 2 years. 25 Articles relevant to our paper are cited in the text. This fi nding seems unlikely because the largest count of secondary cases attributed to a patient is seven (six in a dialysis ward and one outside) and is an outlier.

Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19.
 We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk.
 Findings Countries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city of Beijing, respectively.
 Interpretation Many countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations. Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.","On Jan 30, 2020, WHO declared the current novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. 1 As of , the epidemic registered 42 708 cases in China and spread to 25 countries that reported a total of 395 cases. 2 Limited local transmission outside China was reported in Germany, France, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, Vietnam, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, and the USA.
 All continents reported confirmed cases of COVID-19. Africa confirmed its first case in Egypt on Feb 14, 2020. China is Africa's leading commercial part ner; thus, there are large travel volumes through which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 could reach the continent. Several measures have already been implemented to prevent and control possible case importations from China; 3,4 however, the ability to limit and control local transmission after importation depends on the application and execution of strict measures of detection, prevention, and control. These measures include heightened surveillance and rapid identification of suspected cases, followed by patient transfer and isolation, rapid diagnosis, tracing, and follow-up of potential contacts. 1 The application of such a vast technical and operational set of interventions depends on each country's public health and laboratory infrastructures and resources.
 We assessed the risk of importation of cases of COVID-19 to Africa from affected provinces in China, and contextualised this risk with each country's vulnerability to epidemic emergencies and capacity to respond. Importation risk was determined by the volume of air traffic connections [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] from areas where the virus currently circulates in China. Each country's functional capacity to manage health security issues is based on WHO International Health Regulations (IHR) Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (MEF), 10 and on an indicator of vulnerability to emerging epidemics.
 The risk of importation of cases of COVID-19 to Africa from China was estimated based on origin-destination air travel flows from January, 2019; 8, 11, 12 number of cases in Chinese provinces; and the population in each of the Chinese provinces that reported transmission. Air travel flows counts the number of origin-destination tickets and account for any connection at intermediate airports. 11 Case data included all confirmed cases recorded until Feb 11, 2020. 13 Human population data per province 14 were used to estimate incidence in China. Province-level incidence data were linked to the three airports with the largest volumes in each province (figure 1). 12 The province of Hubei was not included among the possible locations able to export the virus, given the travel ban introduced by Chinese authorities on Jan 23 and 24, 2020. 5 The importation risk per country in Africa was measured as the probability of importing a case from the infected provinces in China, accounting for the origindestination travel flows originated from such provinces and for their different epidemic levels (appendix p 2).
 For sensitivity, we considered a larger area as the basin of attraction of the airports of Beijing and Shanghai, which included their neighbouring provinces (appendix p 2).
 For each African country, the most likely origins of potential case importation were identified by computing a country's exposure to each Chinese province, measuring the probability of a city in China being the origin of a travelling case to the country. Similarity between exposure profiles of different countries was quantified with entropy-based metrics, 15 and used to group countries with similar importation patterns via agglomerative clustering (appendix p 2).
 The WHO IHR MEF is a set of four components developed by WHO to support the evaluation of a country's functional ability to detect and respond to a health emergency. The IHR MEF is composed of a mandatory self-reporting of capacity (the State Party Self-Assessment Annual Reporting [SPAR] 10 ), and three voluntary compo nents, namely the Joint External Evaluation, 16 the after-action reviews, and simulation exercises, which are all collected and dissemi nated by WHO. SPAR generates data and has indicators for all African countries for 2018. 17 Joint External Evaluation is consolidated through joint internal and external evaluation processes. In Africa, Joint External Evaluation data were only available for 43 countries from 2016 to 2019. 16 The 2018 SPAR database 17 contains 24 indicator scores, organised and grouped according to the following capacities (bracketed number shows indicators per capacity 10 ): legislation (three), IHR Coordination (two), zoonoses (one), food safety (one), laboratory (three), surveillance (two), human resource (one), national health emergency framework (three), health service provision (three), communication (one), points of entry (two), chemical events (one), and radi ation emergency (one). The SPAR index was derived to quantify each
 Evidence before this study The current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly within China and across many countries. Very few data are available that describe and estimate the risk of international spread beyond Asia and Europe. We searched PubMed for articles in English published on and before Feb 1, 2020, that included ""coronavirus"", ""CoV"", ""2019-nCoV"", and ""international spread"". Few studies have investigated the risk of spread based on local incidence of COVID-19 in China at the province level, international air travel to countries in Africa, local capacity to detect the outbreak, and capacity to contain the outbreak successfully.
 Given the scarcity of evidence of potential importations of COVID-19 to Africa, we used multiple data streams to assess the risk of spread to countries in Africa. By doing so, we have highlighted the risk of importation based on both local incidence data from provinces in China and air travel from airports most affected by the current outbreak. We further assessed, using multiple indicators, how the capacity to respond varies across the countries identified at risk. To better assess the changing epidemiology of risk, we also predicted how changes in local incidence in China might change the geographical distribution of importation risk in Africa.
 Based on measures of incidence in China, health capacity in Africa, and air travel volumes, the results presented in this study have implications for the prioritisation of deployment of resources across Africa. 13 and annual volume of outflow passenger per airport 12 Cumulative incidence was calculated as total number of confirmed cases per province divided by population of the province.

 Both SPAR and Joint External Evaluation metrics were designed to quantify each country's functional capacity, without accounting for other indirect factors that might compromise the control of emerging epidemics, such as demographic, environmental, socioeconomic, and political conditions. The Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) was introduced as a synthetic metric of vulnerability to account for these factors. 18 Another indicator, the INFORM Epidemic Risk Index, was developed by the EU Joint Research Centre in collaboration with WHO, to account for different combined effects of each country's epidemic transmission risk, infrastructure, vulnerability, and coping capacity. 19 For African countries where data were available, a multivariate analysis of these indicators showed a high correlation between SPAR and Joint External Evaluation indicators, and between IDVI and INFORM Epidemic Risk Index (appendix p 3). Given their coverage and complementarity, we selected SPAR and IDVI for our analysis. Both SPAR and IDVI indicators range from zero to 100, with increasing levels of capacity and decreasing vulnerability, respectively.

 Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa were the countries at highest importation risk from China, with moderate to high SPAR capacity scores (87, 76, and 62, respectively) and IDVI (53, 49, and 69, respectively; figures 2, 3). Countries with the second highest importation risk ranking included Nigeria and Ethiopia, with moderate capacity (51 and 67, respectively), but high vulnerability (27 and 38, respectively), and substantially larger populations potentially exposed (figure 1). Morocco, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya had similar moderate importation risk and population sizes; however, these countries presented variable levels of capacity (ranging from 34 to 75) and an overall low IDVI (<46), reflecting a high vulnerability (except Morocco, with an IDVI of 56). All other countries had low to moderate importation risk and low to moderate IDVI, with most having a low SPAR capacity score, with the exception of Tunisia and Rwanda. No substantial change was observed when the larger basins of attraction for the airports of Beijing and Shanghai were considered (appendix p 3). For comparison, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries had a SPAR ranging from 51 to 99, with a mean of 84·2 (SD 12·36), and an IDVI ranging from 78 to 97, with a mean of 88·3 (SD 6·33; figure 3 ).
 Three clusters were identified among the countries with non-negligible risk ( figure 4) . Each of the clusters corresponded to different Chinese airports as the main source of entry risk. Cluster number 1 was highly exposed to Beijing, and moderately exposed to Guangdong province and Shanghai; cluster number 3 (including Botswana and Lesotho only) was exposed exclusively to the potential risk from airports in the Fujian province; and cluster number 2 was heavily exposed to risk from Guangdong province and weakly to Zhejiang province (figure 4).
 Early detection of COVID-19 importation and prevention of onward transmission are crucial challenges to all countries at risk of importation from areas with active transmission in China. 12 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America have already reported secondary spread following importation. Onward transmission potentially occurring in countries with weaker health systems is a major public health concern.
 We show that the risk of importation to African countries is highly heterogeneous, with Egypt, Algeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, and Nigeria estimated to be at highest risk. We also identified that part of this heterogeneity in Africa depended on the distribution of cases within Chinese provinces. Although certain provinces in China are 21 together with all Chinese airline companies, and others). Previous and current evidence indicates that realistic travel restrictions would have a limited effect in containing the epidemic and would delay the risk that the outbreak extends to new countries by only a few weeks. 8, 22, 23 Travel or trade restrictions are not currently recommended by WHO. 1 Algeria, Ethiopia, South Africa, and Nigeria were part of the 13 top priority countries identified by WHO on the basis of their direct links and volume of travel to China. 4 Egypt, which we estimated to be at highest risk, was not part of that list, although Cairo was identified as the African airport with the highest passenger volume from the affected areas. 9 Few other discrepancies were observed (Morocco and Angola were estimated to be at moderate risk, but did not appear in WHO's 13 top priority list) that might be explained by different risk estimation approaches. In our assessment, we accounted for the distribution of incidence within China and the volume of travel from China with the passenger network. This assessment strongly affects the spatial pattern in the risk of importation. In addition, we considered full origindestination itineraries as opposed to direct flights only. Yet our data do not allow us to distinguish between travel for tourism or business, or across nationalities of passengers. Contrary to Europe, where most cases among initial importations were Chinese tourists travelling for holiday, cases in Africa might be more likely to be business than travel related, given the strong commercial links between African countries and China.
 An insufficiency of passenger data (eg, reason for travel [tourism vs business], nationality, age, sex, and socioeconomic status) also prevent us from accounting for different risk exposure of travellers to China. Travel flow data to estimate risk have already been validated against confirmed imported cases, 8 indicating that homogeneous assump tions on travellers' profiles and risk of exposure in China are enough to explain the exportations reported so far.
 Countries at the highest risk of importation, based on the current epidemic situation in China, had moderate to high capacity scores; however, these scores might correspond to different contributions to the mean SPAR indicators, reflecting different aspects of a country's functional capacity. For example, South Africa had the maximum score for laboratory capacity (100), but a low score in risk communication (20) . Conversely, Nigeria had a low score in the laboratory capacity (27) and the maximum score in the IHR Coordination capacity (100). Conversely, countries with the lowest SPAR capacity score (ie, Kenya, Tanzania, and Ghana) had moderate to low importation risk. The evaluation of additional factors (ie, demographic, socioeconomic, and political factors) included in the IDVI that might influence the overall potential effect of an unfolding epidemic identified several countries that had a significant impor tation risk with a low to medium IDVI, such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Algeria. The risk of importation from other points of entry, such as seaports, was not evaluated.
 Our results should be interpreted carefully. The overall risk of importation to Africa is lower than that to Europe (1% vs 11%, respectively, according to our estimates on the current situation), but response and reaction capacity are also lower. The overall SPAR score and IDVI of African countries are linked to their overall wealth, and are generally significantly lower than many high-income countries with higher overall resources for detection, prevention, and control. Comparatively, China has a SPAR score of 93 and an IDVI of 63.
 African countries have recently strengthened their preparedness against COVID-19 importations. 3, 4, 24 Many countries have improved airport surveillance and implemented temperature screening at ports of entry, 4 thanks to equipment that was readily available following the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic, including high-risk countries according to our analysis-South Africa, Ethiopia, and Nigeria, with the latter also interviewing passengers arriving from China. Overall recommendations to avoid travel to China have been issued (eg, by the Ministry of Health of Nigeria). Communication campaigns have been intensified after the publication of WHO guidelines encouraging the provision of information to health professionals and the general public, often with 24 h dedicated hotlines, as in the case of Senegal. 3 Some countries remain ill-equipped. Some are without the diagnostic capacity for rapid testing for the virus; thus, if cases are imported, tests will need to be done abroad, which might critically increase the delay from identification of suspected cases to their confirmation and isolation, affecting possible disease transmission. WHO is currently supporting countries to improve their diagnostic capacity. In the African region, this capacity has now expanded from just two referral laboratories 4 to a larger set of countries, and is expected to continue to increase in the upcoming weeks. 25 The capacity of these laboratories is still limited by the shortage of personnel trained to run the tests, and inadequate stock of materials needed to do these tests. It is essential to train, equip, and strengthen the diagnostic capacities of hospital laboratories close to infectious disease and emergency departments to reduce the time to deliver results, manage confirmed cases and contacts more rapidly, and preserve strict infection control measures.
 In the African region, resources to set up quarantine rooms for suspected cases at airports and hospitals, or to trace contacts of confirmed cases, as recommended by WHO, might be scarce. 74% of countries in Africa have an influenza pandemic preparedness plan; however, most are outdated (prior to the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic) and considered inadequate to deal with a global pandemic. 26 Countries might not have the same capacity to manage repatriations of nationals (eg, African students) from the province of Hubei in China, as done by high-income countries, because of a scarcity of resources, including personnel, centres, and equipment for quaran tine and isolation. The epidemic in China highlights the rapid saturation of the hospital capacity if the outbreak is not contained. Increasing the number of available beds and supplies in resource-limited countries is crucial in preparation for possible local transmission following importation.
 The aftermath of recent epidemics and pandemics (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1 pandemic, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Ebola) have highlighted the need to reinforce national public health capabilities and infrastructures, including diseasesurveillance systems and laboratory networks, as well as human capacity (eg, training in surveillance, epidemic response, and diagnostic testing). 27, 28 National public health capabilities and infrastructures remain at the core of global health security, because they are the first line of defence in infectious disease emergencies. 27 Crisis management plans should be ready in each African country; involvement of the international community should catalyse such preparedness. Our findings should help to inform urgent prioritisation for intensified support for preparedness and response in specific African countries found to be at moderate to high risk of importation of COVID-19 and with relatively low capacity to manage the health emergency.

Syphilis was fi rst recognised in mainland China in 1505. 2 By the time the Communist party assumed power in 1949, the Chinese people were suff ering one of the biggest syphilis epidemics in human history. Beginning in 2005, syphilis case-reporting moved from paper reports to electronic online submission. 14 To increase the accuracy with which STD incidence could be assessed, a network of 16 sentinel surveillance sites was established in 1987 in areas with high rates of STD. This network was subsequently expanded in 1993 to 26 sites in various cities throughout China. EpiInfo (Version 1.1, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) was used to analyse the results in this study. Total syphilis incidence refers to the number of new syphilis cases at any stage per 100 000 people per year. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and the team of coauthors had fi nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Nationwide surveillance data indicated that after remaining just below 0·2 cases per 100 000 people from 1989 to 1993, the total incidence of syphilis increased from 0·17 cases per 100 000 in 1993 to 6·5 cases per 100 000 in 1999, with incidence of primary and secondary syphilis accounting for 5·85 cases per 100 000 (fi gure 3). The mean ages were slightly higher in northern and central China than in other regions of the country (table 2). Our report provides a comprehensive view of the reemergence of syphilis in China. Syphilis can have devastating health consequences, especially if untreated. 31 Obviously, any defects caused by congenital syphilis would be devastating. 33 Cotransmission of syphilis and HIV has been reported in Pune, India, 34 and syphilis infection in pregnant women might facilitate the vertical transmission of HIV. Grassly and co-workers 37 have argued that the Reported incidence of total syphilis from sentinel sites Reported incidence of total syphilis from nationwide STD surveillance system Incidence (per 100 000) extent of syphilis observed in a population most closely indicates the degree of herd immunity. In their analysis of changes in syphilis incidence in the USA over the past 50 years, they concluded that 10-year cycles of disease resurgence could result from depletion of individuals with immunity resulting from natural infection. 11 A substantial majority of men and a huge migrant population of male workers have created an increasing demand for sex work. Young Chinese people are increasingly likely to experiment with sex at earlier ages and before marriage. 42 Further eff orts should also be directed at groups in which high syphilis prevalence has been documented, such as men who have sex with men 43 and female sex workers. However, these strategies will need much support from local and national leaders, as part of the overall urban and rural health reforms. 46 These targeted interventions have been complemented by mass education campaigns directed at younger people.

Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested.
 Findings Patient 1-a woman in her 60s-returned from China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but had frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted 8 days later and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347 underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195 health-care personnel. Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under investigation, in addition to Patient 2. These 43 persons under investigation and all 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
 Interpretation Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two people with prolonged, unprotected exposure while Patient 1 was symptomatic. Despite active symptom monitoring and testing of symptomatic and some asymptomatic contacts, no further transmission was detected.
 Funding None.","In January, 2020, a novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was iden tified as the causative agent for a cluster of pneumonia cases initially detected in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China. 1 SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease now named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , had spread throughout China and to 26 additional countries as of Feb 18, 2020. 2 Phylogenetic data implicate a zoonotic origin, 3 and the rapid spread suggests ongoing personto-person transmission. Several studies offer additional insight into person-to-person transmission. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] However, substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding the transmissibility between humans, including the level of exposure to a confirmed case at which transmission is more likely to occur.
 On Jan 23, 2020, Illinois, USA, reported the state's first laboratory-confirmed case (index case) of COVID-19 in a traveller who returned from Wuhan in mid-January, 2020. Subsequently, the first evidence of secondary transmission in the USA was reported on Jan 30, when the husband of the index patient, who had not travelled outside the USA, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Public health authorities did an intensive epidemiological investigation of the two confirmed cases.
 This Article describes the first person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 in the USA, including the clinical and laboratory features of both patients and the assessment and monitoring of several hundred individuals with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
 The Illinois Department of Public Health, Chicago Department of Public Health, Cook County Department of Public Health, and DuPage County Health Department consulted with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for technical assistance and invited a CDC field team to assist with onsite investigations after laboratory confirmation of the first case of COVID-19.
 Patients with COVID-19 were defined as individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Contacts were defined as people who reported or were identified to have potential exposure to a case on or after the day of symptom onset of the case (table 1). The earliest reported day with new symptoms was used as date of symptom onset. The date of symptom onset for the index case is considered day 0 for the purposes of this investigation, and all subsequent dates will be described by day of investigation (DOI), starting with DOI 0. In this Article, the numbers of contacts exposed to either case on or after the day of their first positive laboratory result are also presented.
 Patients with COVID-19 were interviewed using a standardised questionnaire to identify symptom history, locations visited while symptomatic, and individuals with whom they had contact while symptomatic. The Illinois COVID-19 Investigation Team, comprised of local and state public health staff and the CDC field team, worked with locations visited (eg, workplaces, retail establishments, or health-care facilities) by patients with COVID-19 to identify additional individuals who might have had exposures to SARS-CoV-2. To identify possible exposures in health-care personnel, patient logs and staffing records were obtained and reviewed for all health-care settings visited by patients with COVID-19. Security footage was reviewed to identify additional health-care personnel and patients who had contact with patients with COVID-19 during transport through the admitting hospital. Health-care personnel were defined as all people working in health-care settings who had the potential for exposure to infectious materials, 12 including members of the Illinois COVID-19 Investigation Team. All other contacts were classified as community members, including patients in the same indoor environment in a health-care setting (eg, a hospital waiting room).
 Health-care personnel and community members with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 were interviewed using standardised contact questionnaires to assess exposure and whether the individual had true contact with a patient with COVID-19. Exposure risk was classified according to frameworks designed by members of the Illinois COVID-19 Investigation Team in consultation with CDC subject-matter experts (table 1) . These frameworks were based on published guidance for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and designed and implemented before interim risk assessment guidance for COVID-19 released by CDC. 10, 11 Active monitoring of contacts All health-care personnel and community contacts assessed to have had low-risk, medium-risk, mediumhigh-risk, or high-risk exposures were enrolled in active symptom monitoring, which continued for 14 days after last exposure to a patient with COVID-19. Active symptom monitoring was done using Research Electronic Data Capture software (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Contacts received automated, twice-daily emails inquiring about symptoms, including cough and shortness of breath, and a request for a self-measured temperature. If symptoms or fever (temperature of >38°C) were reported, or if contacts did not respond or declined email monitoring, public health officials telephoned contacts daily. For hospital-based health-care personnel not excluded from work, pre-shift symptom assessment for fever, cough, or shortness of breath was implemented by hospital occupational health services. To identify any
 Evidence before this study We searched PubMed for articles published between database inception and Feb 18, 2020, describing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using the search terms ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""novel coronavirus"", ""2019-nCoV"", or ""COVID-19""; and ""transmission"", ""person-toperson"", or ""human-to-human"". We found 34 articles, of which 13 were primary reports of person-to-person transmission. None provided full details of the contact investigation and none were from North America.
 We detail prolonged, unprotected contact between a travelrelated index case who was symptomatic and her husband, who subsequently acquired infection. This represents the first known person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA. We also detail a thorough contact investigation related to these cases. We identified, risk-stratified, and actively monitored almost 350 contacts of both cases. 43 contacts developed symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath in the 14 days following their last exposure to either case and were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 32 asymptomatic health-care professional contacts who had exposures across a range of risk levels were also tested for SARS-CoV-2. All 75 tested negative.
 Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two people with prolonged, unprotected exposure. No further transmission was detected, despite monitoring contacts for symptoms and testing all who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath and testing a convenience sample of asymptomatic health-care professional contacts. Further detailed reports of contact investigations associated with cases of SARS-CoV-2 could improve understanding of the transmissibility of this novel virus.
 contacts (including those that could not be reached for active symptom monitoring) seeking care for fever, cough, or shortness of breath at an emergency department, the Illinois Department of Public Health used locally available, near real-time surveillance data received from regional acute care hospitals, which included symptom and diagnoses data and personally identifiable information for matching.
 If a contact developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath during active symptom monitoring, they were classified as a person under investigation (PUI; a standard case designation used by CDC during an outbreak) 13 and were isolated and tested for SARS-CoV-2.
 For PUIs, specimens were collected and sent to CDC for testing. Specimens included upper (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) and lower respiratory specimens (sputum) if spontaneously produced. For patients with COVID-19, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, serum, sputum, urine, and stool specimens were collected and sent to CDC for testing at initial presentation, and then 10 Criteria were based on published MERS-CoV guidance and additional input from CDC subject matter experts. Close contact was defined as being within approximately 6 feet or within the room or care area of a confirmed COVID-19 case (including sharing a health-care waiting area or room), or being in a shared air space vacated by a confirmed case within the previous 2 h. Transient interactions, such as walking by confirmed case, were not considered close contact. Of note, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimen collection were not listed as aerosol-generating procedures in the CDC guidance, but were included as high-risk exposures in this investigation. §Risk categorisation was developed on Jan 31, 2020, before published guidance from CDC for COVID-19. 11 Criteria were based on published MERS-CoV guidance and additional input from CDC and state and local health officials. The medium-high-risk classification was included owing to the identification of some community contacts who did not meet the highest category of exposure risk but were nevertheless concerning. 
 Additionally, a convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts had one-time nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens obtained at least 7 days from their highest-risk exposure. All health-care personnel contacts were offered testing, but laboratory capacity and availability of healthcare personnel to undergo testing were limited in the setting of this urgent investigation. Before Patient 2 reported symptoms to public health investigators, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were also collected from Patient 2 owing to his high-risk exposures to Patient 1. Specimens were collected per CDC guidance. 14 All specimens were refrigerated at 2-8°C before shipping on icepacks to CDC. CDC did real-time RT-PCR (rtPCR) to detect three separate genetic markers of SARS-CoV-2, as previously described. 15 The cycle threshold value ranges for the three markers were interpreted as a semiquanti tative measure of the RNA concentration in the specimen.
 There was no funding source for this study.
 Patient 1 is a female in her 60s who travelled to Wuhan on Dec 25, 2019, and returned to Illinois on Jan 13, 2020, and who was not symptomatic while travelling. In Wuhan, she visited a hospitalised relative regularly and visited other family members who had undiagnosed respiratory illnesses, one of whom was later hospitalised with viral pneumonia. No contacts had laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19, but it is unknown whether any were tested for SARS-CoV-2.
 On DOI 6, she sought care at an outpatient clinic for fever, fatigue, and cough and was hospitalised that day for pneumonia. She was reported to public health authorities as a PUI on DOI 7. Retrospectively, she reported that her symptoms, which also included nausea, abdominal discomfort, and dizziness, started as early as 6 days before admission (figure). Before hospitalisation, she had frequent, close contact with her husband on DOI 0-6 when she had an active cough. Her husband had not travelled to Wuhan. She and her husband live together, eat together, share a bed, and have frequent face-to-face interactions. Facemasks or other personal protective equipment (PPE) were not used at the home. Her husband was classified as having high-risk exposures and began active symptom monitoring on DOI 7 with specimen collection on DOI 11, before his report of any new symptoms. Patient 2 has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with a chronic, productive cough and baseline dyspnoea; therefore, the timing of symptom onset related to COVID-19 was difficult to determine (figure). When first interviewed as a contact on DOI 7, he reported no fever or change in chronic respiratory symptoms. Later, he reported increased dyspnoea and sputum production starting on DOI 11, which was also the first day of specimen collection as a contact in Patient 1's investigation. Upon further interview of Patient 2's contacts, it was suggested that some non-specific symptoms might have started as early as DOI 3, with fatigue and worsening cough. On DOI 14, he reported new haemoptysis and worsening dyspnoea through active monitoring. He was promptly admitted to the hospital and placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens from DOI 11 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on DOI 15.
 On hospital admission, vital signs, and physical examination for Patient 1 were within normal limits. Her chest radiograph demonstrated no abnormalities, but a CT scan of her chest revealed bilateral multifocal infiltrates and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. On admission, Patient 2 had mild tachypnoea and coarse breath sounds with mild wheezes bilaterally, although whether these signs represented a change from his baseline status is unclear. Patient 2's chest radiograph showed emphysematous changes and right lower lobe infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. For both patients, testing for other viral and bacterial respiratory infections was negative. Both experienced mild leukopenia (Patient 1 white blood count nadir 3·0 × 10³ cells per μL, Patient 2 nadir 3·4 × 10³ cells per μL), lympho penia (Patient 1 absolute lymphocyte count nadir 0·7 × 10³ cells per μL, Patient 2 nadir 0·8 × 10³ cells per μL), and mild elevations in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (Patient 1 peak 46 units per L and 66 units per L, Patient 2 peak 47 units per L and 75 units per L). No other remarkable laboratory results were noted.
 Both patients recovered and were discharged to home isolation on DOI 23. Hospital admission was extended while arrangements were made for home isolation. Home isolation for both patients was lifted on DOI 33, following two sets of negative respiratory specimens collected 24 h apart.
 Patient 1 wore a facemask in the emergency department waiting room and was placed on droplet precautions in the emergency department and for the first 10 h after admission. She was subsequently transferred to an AIIR, where health-care personnel entering the patient's room were required to adhere to Standard, Contact, and Airborne Precautions, including hand hygiene, gloves, gown, respirator, and eye protection. 16 Health-care personnel were enrolled in active monitoring, and potential breaches were recorded and investigated to determine risk classification. Patient 2 was immediately evaluated and admitted to an AIIR and placed on Transmission-Based Precautions as described for Patient 1. For Patient 1, initial nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and sputum specimens collected on DOI 7 were positive, whereas serum and urine were negative. Her initial sputum rtPCR cycle threshold values ranged between 24-25, indicating high viral burden before isolation. Sputum specimens remained positive longer than all other specimens for both cases ( figure, appendix pp 3-4) . Stool specimens collected for Patient 1 also remained positive longer than nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens; however, Patient 2 had no positive stool specimens. Neither Patient 1 or 2 had serum or urine specimens that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
 372 contacts of either Patient 1 or Patient 2 were identified. Public health investigators were able to assess exposure risk and actively monitor symptoms for 347 (93%) of the 372 contacts, including 222 (94%) of 236 contacts with exposure on or after the date of first positive specimen collection. There were 25 people that had insufficient contact information to complete active monitoring. None of these individuals were found to have emergency department visits with fever, cough, or shortness of breath using near real-time surveillance data received from regional acute care hospitals for 14 days after their last exposure. Data presented are for those actively monitored. Of these 347 contacts, 195 (56%) were health-care personnel and 152 (44%) were community members. Although the majority of monitored contacts (228 [66%] of 347) had low-risk exposures, 119 (34%) had exposures of medium risk or greater (table 2) .
 Although Patient 1 and 2 live together and were hospitalised in the same facility, and therefore shared several common contacts (65 shared community contacts from emergency department or outpatient waiting rooms and 28 health-care personnel who interacted with both patients), they also had many unique contacts. Patient 1 had 92 unique health-care personnel contacts and 16 unique community contacts, including one household contact (Patient 2). Patient 2 had 75 unique health-care personnel contacts and 71 unique community contacts, including 51 from outpatient waiting rooms.
 The majority of contacts (303 [87%] of 347 total monitored contacts and 195 [88%] of 222 monitored contacts on or after the date of first positive specimen collection) did not develop symptoms consistent with PUI criteria. Additionally, surveillance data from Illinois acute care hospitals indicated that no asymptomatic monitored contacts or other contacts who could not be reached for active symptom monitoring presented to an emergency department with fever, cough, or shortness of breath during DOI 6-30.
 During active symptom monitoring, 44 (13%) of 347 total contacts became PUIs, including 27 (12%) of 222 monitored contacts who had exposures on or after the date of first positive specimen collection.
 As a household contact, Patient 2 was the only community member who had a high-risk exposure. He became a PUI and subsequently the only other patient with COVID-19 in this investigation. Of the remaining 43 PUIs, all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 while symptomatic; 32 of these PUIs were health-care personnel and 11 were community contacts. Although 18 (41%) of 44 PUIs had low-risk exposures, 26 (59%) had exposures of medium risk or greater. 32 health-care personnel contacts who were not PUIs had one-time nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens collected 7-14 days after their highest-risk exposure. All of these exposures occurred on or after the date of first positive specimen collection of a patient with COVID-19. 21 (66%) of these asymptomatic health-care personnel had exposures of medium risk or greater. All were negative for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of testing.
 This Article documents the first known person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA. Transmission occurred between close household contacts, from an index travel-associated case who subsequently transmitted the infection to her husband. Their prolonged, unprotected close contact occurred across multiple days early in her illness, before Patient 1 sought clinical care. No additional cases of COVID-19 were identified through active symptom monitoring of several hundred community and health-care personnel contacts, testing of symptomatic PUIs, or screening of a subset of asymptomatic healthcare personnel contacts. These data suggest that personto-person transmission of COVID-19 might be most likely to occur through unprotected, prolonged exposure to a patient with symptomatic COVID-19. Our experience of limited transmission of SARS-CoV-2 differs from that documented in Wuhan, where transmission has been reported to occur across the wider community and in health-care personnel, 6 and from experiences of other similar coronaviruses. [17] [18] [19] The severity of illness, the extent of viral shedding, and timing of exposures to a symptomatic patient might all have contributed to the limited transmission described here. Infection control measures within the hospital setting and an aggressive public health response might also have prevented further exposures.
 Much like the first US case of COVID-19 in Washington, 20 both Illinois patients had mild-to-moderate illnesses that started with non-specific symptoms, making early identification difficult for patients, clinicians, and public health investigators. Furthermore, Patient 2's baseline cough and dyspnoea made iden tifying new symptoms challenging. These factors have implications for detection of future cases. Clinicians and public health officials should maintain a low threshold for testing in patients with comorbidities that might obscure obvious signs and symptoms of COVID-19.
 The timing and duration of viral shedding after SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. In the two Illinois patients, sputum specimens remained rtPCR-positive longer than other specimen types. Recognising that rtPCR testing detects any SARS-CoV-2 RNA, not necessarily infectious virus, further studies are needed to understand how viral shedding and detection are associated with transmission. Such studies have implications for public health recommendations regarding the type and duration of isolation required for patients with COVID-19 and will allow for more focused and targeted contact tracing and testing of appropriate specimens based on duration of illness.
 These data are preliminary and subject to several limitations. First, this Article describes only one known transmission event and the associated contact investigation. Findings might not be generalisable or representative of broader transmission patterns. Second, this investigation might not have identified all individuals with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, because epidemio logical investigations are dependent on individuals' recall of places visited, people seen, and symptom onset. The date of symptom onset for Patient 2 was especially difficult to ascertain. Given this uncertainty, we applied a conservative approach for identifying contacts of Patient 2 by using the earliest reported date of possible symptom onset, DOI 3. This could have artificially increased the number of contacts and provided false reassurance of infrequent transmission. Therefore, we also present data separately for exposures that occurred on or after the first known date of viral positivity.
 Third, this investigation took place before published CDC guidance for classifying exposure risk among contacts of patients with COVID-19. 10, 12 The risk classification used here differed from the now published guidance in some key areas. For example, we considered nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimen collection aerosol-generating procedures, and therefore classified health-care personnel performing these without all recommended PPE as high risk, whereas they are classified as medium risk according to the guidance. Additionally, we included community members as contacts if they entered the same indoor environment (eg, hospital waiting room) within 2 h of a patient with COVID-19, an approach based on other viruses with airborne transmission patterns, such as measles. Current interim guidance requires contacts to have been in the room at the same time as a patient with COVID-19. Therefore, the risk stratifications used here might not be comparable to future investigations using this guidance.
 Fourth, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens collected on both PUIs and asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were collected at a single timepoint; a single negative SARS-CoV-2 rtPCR might not be sufficient to definitively rule out infection over a 14-day incubation period, and only a convenience sample of a minority of health-care personnel contacts were tested in this study, albeit weighted to capture those with higherrisk exposures. Additionally, the active symptom monitoring employed here would not detect asymptomatic transmission. Future serological studies of exposed contacts will allow a better understanding of asymptomatic infection rates. Furthermore, updated CDC guidance recommends including sore throat as a possible symptom of COVID-19 when evaluating healthcare personnel, 10 whereas in this investigation, only those with fever, cough, or shortness of breath were tested for SARS-CoV-2.
 Nevertheless, our ongoing investigation has only detected transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a single household contact with frequent, prolonged interactions with the index patient. The absence of COVID-19 among healthcare personnel supports recommendations regarding appropriate infection control. These findings also support CDC's assessment that, without using appropriate PPE, people living in the same household as, or providing care in a non-health-care setting for, a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 have high-risk exposure. 21 In these contexts, CDC's recommendation for people with high-risk exposures to remain quarantined with no public activities might be effective in reducing onward person-toperson transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 11 Given the difficulty in detecting new symptoms in patients with underlying lung disease, CDC recommends that clinicians considering a diagnosis of COVID-19 should discuss testing with public health departments on a case-by-case basis. 22 Patients with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath should call their health-care provider before seeking care so that appropriate preventive actions can be implemented. 21 Healthcare facilities should rapidly triage and isolate suspected PUIs and notify infection prevention services and local health departments for support in testing, management, and containment efforts. 22 Contributors IG, TDM, JCH, and HLK each led aspects of the contact investigation and JRV and JEL provided overall leadership and guidance to the investigation.

Outside China, there have been 8774 cases reported from 64 countries with 128 deaths. Other human coronaviruses generally cause mild respiratory infections (eg, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1). 15, 17 DPP4 is less abundant in the nasal cavity and epithelial cells of the upper airways but is highly expressed on the epithelial cells of the distal airways and type I and II pneumocytes in the lung alveoli, non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and some haemopoietic cells. The structures of the S protein of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses have been deter mined using cryoelectron microscopy 16, 17 and provide the basis for rational design of protective antibodies and other therapeutics. 27] [28] [29] Full-genome phylogenetic analysis indicates that evolution of diverse MERS-CoV lineages in camels have caused human infections, perpetuating a low barrier for interspecies transmission. Analysis of population dynamics shows that Arabian viruses can maintain endemicity without introduction of additional lineages. MERS-CoV binds to its cellular receptor DPP4 via the S protein, which is processed by host proteases to expose a fusion peptide. The viral genome is then released into the cytoplasm, where it is translated on host ribosomes into rep1A and rep1B proteins. The polyprotein is cleaved by two viral-encoded proteases, encoded by nsp3 and nsp5. ORF8b is encoded within the N gene (marked with purple lines). After synthesis on replicase-transcription complexes, RNA is encapsidated by the N protein and transported to the ERGIC (endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi compartment), where budding into membranes containing the S, E, and M proteins occurs before release from the cell. MERS-CoV=Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 54] [55] [56] During the acute phase of MERS, robust virus-specific CD8 T-cell responses were detected in most patients with severe or moderate disease, with antibody and CD4 T-cell responses appearing later in the disease course. 2,10,21,61-63 Immunocompromised patients can present with longer incubation periods of up to 20 days. Many individuals remain asymptomatic whereas some go on to develop mild disease, which is why WHO classifies these individuals as mild or asymptomatic. Asymptomatic-to-mild infection rates of 25-50% have been reported. A recombinant camelpox virus expressing the S protein has been shown to induce neutralising antibodies in camels. • • Avoid ingesting raw camel meat, dairy products, or urine. • Vaccine development for people with high camel exposure. • Face masks and hand hygiene measures for all HCW and family contacts. • Occupationally exposed people have a higher risk of infection compared to the general public. 2, 10, 11, [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] It is important that clinicians are alert to the possibility that patients could have MERS in all health-care settings where the virus is circulating so that an accurate diagnosis can be made and infection control measures implemented efficiently. 77] [78] [79] Patients with MERS might not shed the virus during the early stage of their illness; thus, initial negative results from upper respiratory samples do not rule out the possibility of MERS and patients should be retested using a lower respiratory tract sample. 77, 78, 83 These swab kits should contain virus transport medium. A single negative test result does not exclude the diagnosis and repeat sampling and testing is strongly recommended. 77
 WHO guidelines for testing should be followed. 85] [86] [87] A 2018 rapid and specific assay for the detection of MERS-CoV combines the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification technique and a vertical flow visualisation strip (RT-LAMP-VF) to detect the nucleocapsid gene of MERS-CoV. 86 The RT-LAMP-VF assay provides detection of MERS-CoV within 35 min and is easier to perform than the WHO-recommended rRT-PCR method. 87] [88] [89] [90] A case confirmed by serology requires evidence of seroconversion in two samples, ideally taken at least 14 days apart, by a screening (eg, ELISA, immunofluorescence assay) and a neutralisation assay. Lower lobes tend to be affected more than upper lobes early in the course of MERS and rapid opacification of lungs and progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur. 95
 Currently, there are no specific anti-MERS-CoV therapies available for human use. 96 Predictive factors for development of pneumonia include older age (>56 years), high fever, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, C-reactive protein greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL, and a high viral load in sputum (threshold cycle value of rRT-PCR <28·5). 10, 61, 70 Several empirical treatments have been studied in severely ill patients. Preclinical animal data show that transfer of serum samples from MERS-CoVimmune camels to infected mice resulted in reduced weight loss and lung histo pathology, 106 thus suggesting therapeutic potential. 107 Two of three showed neutralising activity. Antibiotic therapy is commonly started empirically in seriously ill patients. 108
 For serious cases, hospital inpatient care is required to reduce the risk of complications such as organ failure and secondary infections. Studies show no benefit from the use of systemic corticosteroids. Systemic corticosteroids were shown to delay viral clearance in critically ill patients with MERS-CoV infection. 100
 A range of potential treatments are under consideration, development, or evaluation (panel 3). Another study is comparing patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support with those who did not receive ECMO support (NCT02627378). 113 Mental health support, accurate information, and appropriate supplies, including food, clothes, and accommodation, should be provided to people who feel isolated. 11, 12 Host factors associated with mortality in this outbreak were older age (>60 years), smoking history, pre-existing pneumonia, abnormal renal function, and comorbidity. Low albumin, altered mentality, and high pneumonia severity index score at admission were risk factors for mortality. Several substantive reviews and WHO guidelines are available on the subject. 21, 61, 76, 96 It is important to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene, and to implement stringent contact and droplet precautions among health-care workers. 20, 60 In hospitals, early case detection followed by isolation is essential, ideally in negative pressure isolation rooms. 121 Multiple types of vaccine candidates are in development including inactivated whole virus, live attenuated virus, viral vectored vaccines, subunit vaccines, and DNA vaccines.

22,22,3e3c84ba064eb8d3a0f7972d43235da7271478e8,,The Health of Americans 2 Challenges of infectious diseases in the USA,"In the USA, infectious diseases continue to exact a substantial toll on health and health-care resources. Endemic diseases such as chronic hepatitis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections aff ect millions of individuals and widen health disparities. Additional concerns include health-care-associated and foodborne infections-both of which have been targets of broad prevention eff orts, with success in some areas, yet major challenges remain. Although substantial progress in reduction of the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases has been made, continued cases and outbreaks of these diseases persist, driven by various contributing factors. Worldwide, emerging and reemerging infections continue to challenge prevention and control strategies while the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance needs urgent action. An important priority for control of infectious disease is to ensure that scientifi c and technological advances in molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics are well integrated into public health. Broad and diverse partnerships across governments, health care, academia, and industry, and with the public, are essential to eff ectively reduce the burden of infectious diseases.","Infectious disease prevention and control continues to improve for much of the world. During the past two decades, overall mortality from infectious causes decreased, with notable decreases recorded for lower respiratory tract infections and diarrhoeal diseases. 1 Despite these successes, infectious diseases accounted for nearly a quarter of the estimated 52·8 million deaths in 2010. 1 The eff ect of these diseases varies greatly by geographical area and populations, with low-income countries most aff ected.
 In the USA, attention to and action against emerging infections and infectious diseases greatly increased after a 1992 landmark report by the Institute of Medicine (Emerging infections: microbial threats to health in the United States). 2, 3 The report clearly outlined the increased risk of emerging infections in a highly connected world, highlighted the nation's crumbling public health infrastructure, and called for substantial improvements in the USA's capacity to address these mounting challenges. In response to this report, both the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed research and prevention strategies to reduce emerging infectious diseases 4, 5 and improve preparedness for outbreaks. At CDC, this plan led to the development and implementation of many new programmes designed to improve epidemiology and laboratory capacity at the national, state, and local levels. In the 1990s and early 2000s, substantial complementary investments were made to build similar, multilevel capacity against bioterrorism threats. During the past two decades, these networks, systems, and programmes have helped to forge strong links between clinical, research, and public health communities and strengthened US capacity to detect and respond to national and international outbreaks.
 Our Series paper describes examples of recent and continuing challenges to control infectious diseases in the USA. We discuss vaccine-preventable diseases and the substantial successes and persistent challenges in their control; health-care-associated infections (HAIs), a leading preventable cause of death; emerging zoonotic and vector-borne diseases and their spread across a globalised world; foodborne infections, increasingly linked to new sources of contamination; and the intersecting epidemics of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), chronic viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis. Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, several of which have become or are becoming resistant to all available drugs, are intensifying these threats. In addition to their eff ect • Despite major advances towards their control, infectious diseases continue to present substantial challenges to health and health-care resources in the USA • Priority actions to meet these challenges include addressing high-burden diseases such as HIV and chronic hepatitis, foodborne diseases, and health-care-associ ated infections; targeting outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases; and controlling endemic and emerging vector-borne and zoonotic infections • Antimicrobial resistance has become a global health crisis that demands new multidisciplinary approaches and collaborations across local, state, regional, national, and international levels • Rapidly evolving molecular technologies and increases in microbial understanding off er new opportunities for treatment, prevention, and control of infectious diseases • Ongoing enhancements in communication capacities, including social media, are bringing new techniques to monitor infectious diseases and rapidly share prevention information on human health, these diseases cause substantial health-care, workplace, and other societal costs. We discuss priority actions needed to meet these challenges including modernisation of existing surveillance systems to better inform public health action; enhancement of public health laboratories to incorporate the latest molecular technologies for improved disease detection and outbreak response; and strengthening of the clinical and public health interface to facilitate information exchange and leverage changes in health care to improve prevention and control of infectious diseases.
 The development and widespread delivery of safe and eff ective vaccines is one of the most benefi cial and cost-saving means to control infectious diseases. For each US birth cohort receiving recommended childhood immunisations, around 20 million illnesses and more than 40 000 deaths are prevented, which results in about US$70 billion savings in direct and societal costs. 6 Since 2000, new vaccines against pneumococcal disease, rotavirus, meningococcal disease, herpes zoster, and human papillomavirus (HPV) have been introduced and recommended for diff erent populations as part of US public health policy. Immunisations against pneumococcal disease and rotavirus infection have had a substantial eff ect. Routine vaccinations for infants with a seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), which began in 2000, greatly decreased the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in young children, and indirectly in adults. 7 From 1998-99 to 2007, overall incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease decreased by 45%; 8 in children (aged <5 years) the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease decreased from around 99 cases per 100 000 population during 1998-99 to 21 cases per 100 000 population in 2008. 9 In 2010, a 13-valent vaccine (PCV13) was introduced that off ered protection against an additional six serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae. By the end of 2011, rates of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by these six serotypes had decreased by nearly 90% in children younger than 5 years and by 45-64% in adults compared with pre-PCV13 introduction rates. 10 Rotavirus vaccination, recommended for US infants from 2006, has had a substantial eff ect on the number of hospital admissions for diarrhoea in young children. Compared with pre-vaccine years, an estimated 77 000 fewer admissions for diarrhoea occurred in US children (aged <5 years) during 2008-09, which reduced hospital costs by around $242 million. 11 Substantial and sustained decreases in rotavirus activity have occurred during every rotavirus season since the vaccine was introduced, with the number of positive rotavirus tests decreasing by 74-90% during 2010-11 and 2011-12 rotavirus seasons compared with pre-vaccine years. 12 The success of these vaccines could mask the toll and dangers of these once prevalent infections; thus focused eff orts are needed to communicate the continued importance of immunisations.
 Vaccination against HPV, the most common STI in the USA, 13 has been recommended for preteens and young adults since 2006 for girls 14 and since 2011 for boys. 15 HPV infections play a causal part in many cancers including cervical, other anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancers. Vaccination protects against the HPV types that cause 70% of cervical and most of the other HPV-attributable cancers. One of the two available vaccines also protects against genital warts. However, uptake of the three-dose HPV vaccination series has been disappointingly slow. In 2011, only 53% of girls aged 13-17 years had received at least one vaccine dose and only 35% had completed the series. 16 Eff orts to motivate health-care providers to off er the HPV vaccine and educate parents and young women of its cancer-preventing capacity are important components of this disease-reducing strategy.
 US outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseasesparticularly measles, mumps, and pertussis-result from many factors including disease importation, parental decisions to delay or refuse immunisations, and waning vaccine-induced immunity. Although the USA was declared to have eliminated measles in 2000, 17 around 50-100 imported cases occur every year. In 2011, however, more than 220 measles cases and 17 outbreaks were reported in the USA, mainly linked to large outbreaks in several European countries. 18 This number was the highest yearly total of US reported cases of measles since the elimination of this disease until 2014, when ongoing outbreaks had resulted in almost 288 cases by May 23. 19 These cases emphasise the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage and ensuring appropriate messaging for travellers. Such cases can also present specifi c concerns for health-care settings. Because cases of measles are rare, health-care providers might not recognise signs or symptoms, which can facilitate further spread, including by health-care providers who do not have complete immunisations or immunity. 20 Containment of measles outbreaks requires substantial public health resources. Estimated public health costs from two 2011 outbreaks in Utah aff ecting 13 people exceeded $330 000. 21 In 2006, the largest US outbreak of mumps in two decades was reported, with 6584 cases-most from eight mid-western states and colleges. 22 As with other US mumps outbreaks, 23,24 cases mainly included people living in close proximity such as dormitories and occurred despite high coverage rates of two-dose vaccine. Although the need for a third-dose of mumps-containing vaccine to be given during outbreaks and for the development of an improved vaccine has been discussed, the benefi t of these additional strategies is unclear.
 Although outbreaks of measles and mumps have been episodic in the USA, the country has had sustained increases in pertussis cases (fi gure 1). In the mid-1990s, pertussis vaccination shifted from whole-cell to an acellular vaccine to reduce adverse events. However, in the mid-2000s, illness in children and teens began to rise despite high vaccination rates, which prompted new recommendations for a pertussis booster (Tdap) in teenagers. 25 Even with these new recommendations, pertussis rates have continued to increase, with substantial outbreaks in California in 2010, 26 and in Washington State in 2011-12. 27 A retrospective study 28 in California showed that waning immunity from the acellular vaccines was the probable cause of disease resurgence. Research is in progress to improve defi nitions for predictors of immunity and to strengthen control eff orts. Priority activities are focused on reduction of pertussis-related deaths, which occur mainly in young infants, prompting US recommendations for Tdap vaccination for pregnant women and people in close contact with infants. 29
 Every year, around one in fi ve patients acquires an HAI in US hospitals. 30 These infections result in about $26-33 billion in excess medical costs and around 99 000 deaths yearly. 30, 31 However, these estimates do not include the substantial burden and consequences of HAIs in non-hospital settings such as long-term care facilities, dialysis settings, and outpatient clinics, where an increasing number of invasive practices are done. HAI reduction strategies largely focus on endemic problems such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central-line-associated bloodstream infections, and surgical-site infections, all of which can fuel antimicrobial resistance. Investigations of HAI-related outbreaks can provide important information for improvements in infection control. 32 For example, infections due to unsafe injection practices, 33 including reuse of syringes and inappropriate use of single-use vials, have led to targeted educational campaigns for both patients and health-care providers. 34 Outbreaks have also occurred from contaminated products including those prepared in compounding pharmacies. In 2012-13, a large HAI outbreak in the USA-involving more than 14 000 patients who were potentially exposed and resulting in 751 reported cases of fungal infections, including 384 cases of meningitis and 64 deaths across 20 states 35 -was caused by injections of contaminated steroids produced by a single compounding facility. 36 In the early to mid-2000s, several large-scale US regional and state-wide projects showed substantial decreases for central-line-associated bloodstream infections in intensive care units through focused eff orts to increase adherence to a set of recommended practices for insertion and maintenance of intravascular catheters. 37, 38 Momentum from these and other successes [39] [40] [41] led to new federal, state, and local eff orts to prevent HAIs. In 2009, a national action plan was released, setting goals and metrics for the prevention of HAIs. 42 Additional eff orts included state mandates for HAI reporting to improve accountability and fi nancial incentives off ered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for adherence to CDC's infection control guidelines. All 50 states now have HAI prevention plans and state HAI coordinators, resulting in stronger links between health-care facilities, state health departments, state hospital associations, and qualityimprovement organisations.
 A major component of eff orts to reduce HAI infections is CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), the most extensive and widely used HAI tracking system in the USA. With NHSN, data for HAIs and other related issues, including adherence rates of infection control, use of antibiotics, infections with multidrug-resistant organisms, and safety and vaccinations of health-care personnel, are obtained and made available to facilities, states, and regional and national organisations to help to identify and correct problems and to measure progress. Established as the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System in 1970, NHSN includes more than 12 000 facilities in all 50 states and extends beyond hospitals to include outpatient dialysis centres and nursing homes. Numbers of participating facilities and types of data obtained are expected to increase in the future. Reports of NHSN data, including national and state-specifi c reports of standardised infection ratios, have shown many successes in the reduction of the burden of certain HAIs, including a 41% decrease in central-line-associated bloodstream infections, 17% decrease in surgical-site infections, and 7% decrease in catheter-associated urinary tract infections in 2011 when compared with baseline (2008, 2009) rates. 43 Despite these successes, additional eff orts are needed, with intensifi ed actions aimed at reduction of antibiotic-resistant threats. 44 Comprehensive approaches are needed to prevent introduction and spread of infections as patients move between and within health-care facilities and into communities. A major concern is Clostridium diffi cile infection, a common and sometimes fatal infection that occurs mainly in association with health-care settings in patients receiving antibiotics. Transmitted by the faecal-oral route, C diffi cile infections rapidly spread in these settings because spores can survive on fomites and environmental surfaces for months. From 2000-09, discharge diagnoses of C diffi cile infection in patients in US hospitals more than doubled-from 139 000 to 336 600-and the number of patients with a primary C diffi cile infection diagnosis tripled, from 33 000 to 111 000, and only recently have these infections begun to plateau. 45 47 CRE infections can be severe, with mortality rates more than 40%, 48 and can easily spread from hospitals to other health-care settings in communi ties. CRE containing New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) are of particular concern; NDM enzymes can be encoded on plasmids, which spreads multidrug-resistance to other Enterobacteriaceae and other bacteria. Identifi cation of patients colonised by or infected with CRE and segregation of patients and staff can reduce these infections, 49 but additional steps are needed. A crucial measure to control antibiotic resistance is eff ective implementation of antibiotic stewardship programmes to restrict the use of these drugs for appropriate indications. Additional eff orts include enhanced surveillance and laboratory networks with advanced molecular diagnostic capacities to improve detection, characterisation, and control of these infections.
 Zoonotic and vector-borne diseases represent most emerging infections in the USA and worldwide. 50 In 2012, two notable outbreaks of zoonotic diseases in the USA were caused by Sin Nombre virus-the causative agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome-that was carried by deer mice infesting cabins in Yosemite National Park 51 and by a variant swine infl uenza virus carried by pigs exhibited at agricultural fairs. 52, 53 The variant swine infl uenza virus and avian infl uenza strains fi rst reported in China (H5N1 54 and H7N9 55, 56 ) are closely monitored because of concerns about their potential to evolve into pandemic strains with the capacity for sustained human-to-human transmission. The infl uenza strain that caused the 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic, which was fi rst reported in the USA, was a genetic reassortment of swine, avian, and human infl uenza viruses. 57 Public health authorities are also carefully monitoring a novel coronavirus, 58 termed the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which belongs to the same viral species as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, a zoonotic virus linked to Chinese horseshoe bats. 59 Associated with a 30% death rate, MERS-CoV has been focused in countries in the Arabian Peninsula, mainly Saudi Arabia, and has garnered global attention towards its control. Sporadic clusters of MERS-CoV cases had been reported since April, 2012, but in March, 2014, cases began to increase substantially, with 493 cases of the 699 laboratory-confi rmed cases reported from March 27 to June 11, 2014. 60 In May, 2014, two cases of MERS-CoV were reported in the USA (in Indiana and Florida) in travellers from Saudi Arabia.
 Mosquito-borne illnesses are particularly unpredictable and diffi cult to control. 61 West Nile virus (WNV), which was fi rst reported in in the USA in 1999, 62 is now the main cause of arboviral disease in the country, aff ecting thousands of people every year. 63, 64 Major outbreaks have occurred periodically (fi gure 2). In 2012, 5674 cases, including 2873 cases of WNV neuroinvasive disease and 286 deaths, were reported. 65 Texas was at the epicentre of the 2012 outbreak 66 with about a third of all reported cases. 64 High proportions of WNV neuroinvasive disease suggest reporting bias, however, because severe cases are more likely than mild cases to be reported and asymptomatic infections would probably not be detected. Data from population-based surveys show that Year in all people who become infected with WNV (including people with asymptomatic infections) less than 1% will develop severe neuroinvasive disease. 67 In addition to WNV, dengue fever, the most prevalent vector-borne viral disease in the world, is resurging globally, aff ecting millions of people, including in Asia (70% of all cases, worldwide), Africa (16%), and the Americas (14%). 68 Puerto Rico, which has had epidemics of dengue activity periodically since 1963, reported the largest dengue outbreak in its history in 2010, with more than 21 000 cases. 69 In 2009 and 2010, Florida reported the fi rst cases of dengue acquired in the continental USA outside of the Texas-Mexico border since 1945. 70 The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and CDC are working to strengthen dengue control in the Americas and to ensure public heath preparedness for detection and control of exotic mosquito-borne diseases. One example is chikungunya fever, 71 a dengue-like disease fi rst detected in Tanganyika in 1953 that spread to parts of Asia and Europe, 72 and has now emerged in the Americas. 73 Between December, 2013, and June, 2014, cases of chikungunya infection have been reported in almost 20 countries in the Americas, mainly in the Caribbean. 73 The incidence and geographical spread of tick-borne diseases is increasing in the USA. Lyme disease-the most commonly reported vector-borne illness in the USA-has spread from northeast to mid-Atlantic regions and the upper Midwest along with its insect vector (the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis); these insects can also carry parasites that cause babesiosis and bacteria that cause human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. 74 Additional areas endemic for Lyme disease occur along the Pacifi c coast. 75 Another endemic tick-borne disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever-caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii-has become a particularly serious problem on Arizonan tribal lands in areas where the disease was not previously reported. These disease outbreaks represent the fi rst time that Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the brown dog tick, has been confi rmed as a vector for Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the USA. 76, 77 This tick feeds on dogs at every stage of its life cycle and usually lives in and around homes. CDC, the Arizona Department of Health Services, the Indian Health Service, and tribal health departments are working to test a prevention and vector control strategy for Rocky Mountain spotted fever that includes homeowner education, use of acaricides, tick collaring, and control of the local dog population. 78 Additionally, within the past 4 years, two previously unknown tickborne pathogens whose epidemiology, transmission patterns, and clinical spectrum of illness remain unclear, have been identifi ed in the USA: an Ehrlichia muris-like agent in Minnesota and Wisconsin 79 and the Heartland phlebovirus in Missouri. 80 Public health eff orts to reduce illness and deaths from zoonotic and vector-borne diseases focus on improvements to disease surveillance, public health education, treatment, and prevention, and on actions to sustain and strengthen vector control programmes. 81 These strategies also off er increased opportunities to improve collaborations for infectious disease control between human, animal, and environ mental health experts-the concept of One Health.
 Every year, around 48 million foodborne illnesses occur in the USA, resulting in 128 000 admissions to hospital and 3000 deaths. 82, 83 About 9·4 million of these illnesses can be attributed to major pathogens, mainly norovirus, non-typhoidal Salmonella spp, Clostridium perfringens, and Campylobacter spp. 82 Although most foodborne illnesses do not occur as part of recognised outbreaks, around 1000 US foodborne disease outbreaks are reported every year, aff ecting tens of thousands of individuals. 84 Most of these outbreaks are local; however, multistate outbreaks have been detected more often in recent years. In 2011, CDC investigated about 30 major multistate outbreaks. These increases in frequency, however, could partly be a result of improved detection, surveillance, and typing methods for foodborne infections.
 Factors that might facilitate multistate foodborne disease outbreaks include centralised food production and processing, and subsequent broad distribution of products. 2, 85 In the past few years, eff orts to improve food safety in the USA through regulations and policies include the Egg Safety Rule, passed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010, to decrease Salmonella contamination of shell eggs, and the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act, which expands FDA's authority to improve food safety and highlights CDC's eff orts to improve foodborne disease surveillance and outbreak responses.
 Since 1996, the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet)-a collaboration with CDC, ten state health departments, academic institutions, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS), and FDA-has done active, population-based surveillance of laboratory-confi rmed infections caused by major foodborne pathogens. Although progress to address several key foodborne pathogens has been made, 86 particularly with Shiga toxinproducing E coli serotype O157, in recent years progress has stalled. 87, 88 The rate of Salmonella infections-the most commonly reported foodborne infection-has been largely unchanged. 88 In the USA, Salmonella causes around 1 million infections 82 and $365 million in direct medical costs every year. 86 An important component in eff orts to identify and stop foodborne disease outbreaks is PulseNet, a national network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories that use pulsed-fi eld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns to identify clusters of foodborne illnesses that might signal an outbreak. In the USA, more than 80 state and federal laboratories participate in this For more on PulseNet see http:// www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/ surveillance system and submit PFGE patterns from six bacterial pathogens to a CDC database to identify similar cases of foodborne illnesses that might signal an outbreak. Over the past 15 years, this system has detected hundreds of outbreaks, enabling faster and more accurate responses. PulseNet-triggered investigations have resulted in the recall of more than 1·5 billion pounds of contaminated food and have prompted new actions by industry and food regulatory agencies to make food safer. Since 2006, data from foodborne disease investigations have identifi ed more than a dozen newly implicated foods in foodborne disease outbreaks (panel). Data from nearly 4600 outbreaks in 1998-2008 were used to help to establish the proportion of foodborne illnesses attributable to specifi c food commodities across 17 major food categories. Produce accounted for almost half of all foodborne illnesses from these outbreaks, with most deaths caused by meat and poultry. 89 Because many foodborne disease outbreaks occur across many states and countries and therefore could go undetected, eff orts to ensure the continued capability of laboratory-based and cluster-detection surveillance systems such as PulseNet are crucial. Detection of bacterial pathogens is changing from culture to an increased use of point-of-care molecular tests. 90 Although these tests have great potential for broader applications in detection and control of infectious diseases, the increased use of cultureindependent diagnostics brings new challenges to public health laboratory-based surveil lance systems that rely on culture and bacterial isolates for strain identifi cation. Fundamental changes in these systems are needed to ensure their continued eff ectiveness.
 Despite major advances in prevention, treatment, and care, HIV infection is a substantial challenge to public health worldwide. In the USA, around 1·1 million people are living with HIV. 91 The epidemic is generally concentrated in urban areas and disproportionately aff ects African-Americans, Latinos, and men who have sex with men (MSM). 91 Overall, incidence has remained stable for more than a decade, 92 with an estimated 47 500 new infections in 2010. 93 However, in young MSM, particularly young black MSM, rates of new infections have increased, 93 prompting targeted campaigns to help to engage with these populations. 94 Despite public health recommendations for routine HIV testing for people aged 13-64 years, 95 around 16% of people infected are unaware of their infection, 91 precluding access to life-prolonging treatment and increasing the risk of transmission to their sexual partners. With data showing that antiretroviral drugs reduce the risk of HIV transmission and acquisition, 96,97 prevention eff orts include treatment for people living with HIV and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for people who are HIV negative but at a substantial risk for HIV. Only 25% of the US population with HIV is virally suppressed, and improvements are needed at each stage of the continuum of care, with particular attention to disparities in race or ethnicity and age. 98 For example, young people are less likely to have their infection diagnosed or have viral suppression compared with other age groups. 98 To address the US epidemic, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) was released in 2010, with main goals to: reduce HIV incidence; increase access to care and improve health outcomes for people with HIV; and reduce HIV-related health disparities. 99 CDC's eff orts to advance the NHAS goals are focused on the combination of evidenced-based, cost-eff ective, and scalable prevention interventions for geographical areas and populations with the greatest burden of HIV. Expanded surveillance to monitor community CD4 cell counts and viral loads is also increasingly used to target high burden areas. 100 As new prevention options such as PrEP emerge, operational research will guide implementation of interventions, whether biomedical, behavioural, or structural, to strengthen eff orts to mitigate the US epidemic. 101
 Around 20 million newly acquired STIs occur every year in the USA, 13 resulting in about $16 billion in health-care costs. 102 Nearly half these infections occur in young people (aged 15-24 years). 13 Similar to HIV, racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately aff ected by STIs, as shown in chlamydia and gonorrhoea national surveillance data. 103 In 2012, chlamydia and gonorrhoea rates of infection for black people were around seven and 15 times higher, respectively, than those for white people. 103 Another urgent challenge for prevention and control of STIs is the threat of emerging cephalosporin resistance, which could lead to untreatable gonorrhoea (fi gure 3). 104, 105 Gonorrhoea is the second most commonly reported US notifi able disease, 103 and if untreated can lead to severe health outcomes including pelvic infl ammatory disease and subsequent infertility. To address this challenge requires enhanced surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility such as through the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project; improved primary prevention, screening, and partner services; and development of new therapies. 103, 105 Guidelines to treat gonorrhoea have been changed to preserve the last available eff ective treatment option for as long as possible. 106
 Although US rates of acute viral hepatitis infection have decreased overall during the past two decades, 107 chronic hepatitis remains a substantial challenge. Around 800 000 to 1·4 million people in the USA are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 2·7-3·9 million have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). 107 Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately aff ected; HCV prevalence in non-Hispanic black people is about double that in non-Hispanic white people, 108 and Asian and Pacifi c Islanders account for more than half of all Americans living with chronic HBV infection. 109 Many people with chronic hepatitis do not know that they are infected, which increases their risk for cirrhosis or liver cancer and for unknowingly transmitting infection. A national action plan for viral hepatitis, released in 2011 and updated in 2014, provides steps to improve prevention, increase diagnosis and access to care for individuals infected, and improve coordination of federal and partner eff orts. 110 With improvements in treatment for HCV now available, CDC has issued revised HCV testing recommendations 111 that augment risk-based guide lines 112 and recommend one-time testing for people born between 1945 and 1965 to identify undiagnosed infections 113 and link individuals with HCV to care. People in this designated baby boomer age cohort now account for around 75% of prevalent HCV infections and HCV-related mortality. 114 Implementation of these revised testing recommendations could thus identify an estimated 800 000 additional cases and avert about 120 000 deaths. 115
 Although rates of tuberculosis cases in the USA are at record lows (less than 10 000 new cases were reported in 2012), the disease continues to disproportionately aff ect people born outside the USA and racial and ethnic minorities. 116 Outbreaks also occur in hard-to-reach populations, such as drug users and the homeless. 117, 118 Diagnosis and management of the 11 million people in the USA with latent tuberculosis infection is a challenge but is essential since most active disease results from such infections. 119, 120 Key strategies include targeted testing and treatment and engagement of medical providers outside of public health departments. 119 Although more pressing globally, management of tuberculosis and HIV co-infection and surveillance for drug resistance are important components of tuberculosis control eff orts in the USA. 116, 121 Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant strains continue to challenge elimination goals for tuberculosis, and fi rst-generation and second-generation antituberculosis drug shortages have occurred. The FDA accelerated approval of bedaquiline, a novel drug for the treatment of pulmonary MDR tuberculosis. 122
 For any country, eff ective control of infectious diseases is dependent on focused eff orts to decrease endemic infections in at-risk and susceptible populations, combined with strong epidemiological and laboratory capacity to detect and stop emerging threats. Inherent in these eff orts are well established links between clinical, public health, and research communities working with non-traditional partners such as industry, law enforcement, businesses, and the media. Although at their core these collaborations need to be established locally, such crucial partnerships have to extend across state, national, and international levels. Together, these alliances can form a global infrastructure and system to detect and control infectious diseases. With that aim, in February, 2014, the USA and other nations joined WHO, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, and the World Organization for Animal Health in a new global health security agenda designed to enhance strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to threats of infectious disease. 123 Partner countries will work together to meet a series of objectives covering crucial issues aff ecting control of infectious disease such as antimicrobial resistance, biosafety and biosecurity, global disease detection and response networks, and emergency responses. Much emphasis has been placed on the aptly named perfect storm inherent in today's globalised world for rapid emergence and spread of infectious diseases. Despite this persistent challenge, extraordinary achievements in science and technology continue to bolster the capacity to recognise and respond to these threats. Scientifi cally, next-generation sequencing and state-of-the-art bioinformatics capabilities are transforming the practice of microbiology and the speed at which infectious pathogens can be detected and analysed. 85,124 These technologies provide a new level of information about infectious pathogens and therefore off er tremendous opportunities for public health eff orts to detect and control outbreaks, target antimicrobial resistance, and develop and refi ne treatments and vaccines. [125] [126] [127] Additionally, the increasing understanding of the role of human microbiomes in disease development and new links between infectious agents and chronic diseases opens new possibilities for disease prevention and treatment. 128 Advances in electronic communications have also been essential and have enabled rapid sharing of health and safety information and expertise by health-care and public health workers, researchers, law enforcement, the media, and private individuals. These communication capacities can facilitate and enhance research and public health partnerships worldwide, generating broad sharing of research fi ndings and health updates in near real time. The latest surge in health communications has come from social media tools, which are increasingly being used to extend the reach of public health information. To ensure that these rapidly changing scientifi c and technological advances are routinely used in public health is a crucial challenge and priority.
 The remarkable ability of infectious agents to adapt to new environments and exploit the susceptibilities of their hosts will continue to complicate and obstruct eff orts for their control. In the USA, the largest gains will be achieved through focused eff orts to reduce high burden and high consequence diseases and to strengthen eff orts to promote early detection of and rapid response to emerging infections. Priorities for these eff orts include prevention measures with broad-reaching eff ects such as vaccines, multifaceted approaches to decrease antimicrobial resistance, and testing and education to reduce the further spread of preventable infections. In addition, new opportunities for control of infectious disease are envisioned through US health reforms, which are expanding access to care and improving health-care coordination for many underserved populations.",3e3c84ba064eb8d3a0f7972d43235da7271478e8,2014-07-11,"Khabbaz, Rima F; Moseley, Robin R; Steiner, Riley J; Levitt, Alexandra M; Bell, Beth P",The Lancet,10.1016/s0140-6736(14)60890-4,The Lancet,700.0,True,"On Jan 30, 2020, WHO declared the current novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. All continents reported confirmed cases of COVID-19. Africa confirmed its first case in Egypt on Feb 14, 2020. Air travel flows counts the number of origin-destination tickets and account for any connection at intermediate airports. SPAR generates data and has indicators for all African countries for 2018. 17 Joint External Evaluation is consolidated through joint internal and external evaluation processes. In Africa, Joint External Evaluation data were only available for 43 countries from 2016 to 2019. Given the scarcity of evidence of potential importations of COVID-19 to Africa, we used multiple data streams to assess the risk of spread to countries in Africa. By doing so, we have highlighted the risk of importation based on both local incidence data from provinces in China and air travel from airports most affected by the current outbreak. Based on measures of incidence in China, health capacity in Africa, and air travel volumes, the results presented in this study have implications for the prioritisation of deployment of resources across Africa. 13 and annual volume of outflow passenger per airport 12 Cumulative incidence was calculated as total number of confirmed cases per province divided by population of the province.

The first author and the corres ponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Each of the clusters corresponded to different Chinese airports as the main source of entry risk. Although certain provinces in China are 21 together with all Chinese airline companies, and others). Previous and current evidence indicates that realistic travel restrictions would have a limited effect in containing the epidemic and would delay the risk that the outbreak extends to new countries by only a few weeks. 8, 22, 23 Travel or trade restrictions are not currently recommended by WHO. 9 Few other discrepancies were observed (Morocco and Angola were estimated to be at moderate risk, but did not appear in WHO's 13 top priority list) that might be explained by different risk estimation approaches. This assessment strongly affects the spatial pattern in the risk of importation. Countries at the highest risk of importation, based on the current epidemic situation in China, had moderate to high capacity scores; however, these scores might correspond to different contributions to the mean SPAR indicators, reflecting different aspects of a country's functional capacity. For example, South Africa had the maximum score for laboratory capacity (100), but a low score in risk communication (20) . Our results should be interpreted carefully. African countries have recently strengthened their preparedness against COVID-19 importations. 3, 4, 24 Many countries have improved airport surveillance and implemented temperature screening at ports of entry, 4 thanks to equipment that was readily available following the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic, including high-risk countries according to our analysis-South Africa, Ethiopia, and Nigeria, with the latter also interviewing passengers arriving from China. Overall recommendations to avoid travel to China have been issued (eg, by the Ministry of Health of Nigeria). All data used are publicly available, and sources are cited throughout."

 reported to have SARS after exposure to an index case. One infected staff member had no exposure to any admitted patient with SARS and was classified as a communityacquired infection. All index patients and infected staff in the study, except for one, showed a four-fold rise in the number of antibodies to corona-like virus.
 356 completed questionnaires were returned, covering 85% of the staff on roster. Non-responders were mostly those on leave or night shift, which is rotated among the staff. We excluded 102 staff who had no contact with index patients. Most of the infected staff were from the medical wards (table 1) , and omitted at least one of the four measures queried. Two who were using a mask reported only paper masks.
 Staff who used masks, gowns, and handwashing were less likely to develop SARS than those who did not use them, but the association for gloves was not significant (table 2) . None of the 69 staff reporting use of all four measures became infected. By contrast, all 13 infected staff had omitted at least one of the measures (p=0·0224). However logistic regression of the four measures with forward stepwise selection showed that only use of masks was significant in the final model (table 2) .
 The staff who wore surgical masks and N95 masks were significantly associated with non-infection (table 2), but this was not seen for paper masks.
 That use of masks and hand-washing was associated with non-infection, and that no staff became infected when they used all four measures, suggest that precautions against droplets and contact are adequate for prevention of nosocomial SARS, where no aerosolisations are expected. The surgical and N95 masks were both effective in significantly reducing the risk of infection, which together with the finding that 30% of non-infected staff did not use masks (table 2) supports that transmission is not airborne. The finding that paper masks did not significantly reduce the risk is not unexpected. Such masks, being easily wet with saliva, are never recommended as a precaution against droplets. 3 In any survey, recall bias is a concern. However, it probably had little effect since the associations shown are clear and the information requested was about simple concrete behaviour and events that took place recently. Masks seem to be essential for protection, since only this measure was significant in stepwise logistic regression. Thus, in hospital, the other three measures add no significant protection to the mask. This finding fits well with droplets transmission because droplets are generated at the face level making the mask crucial for protection.

He was examined by JJYS. His fever had gone by March 12, and his chest radiograph was normal. His platelet count was 94ϫ10 9 /L and white-cell count was 3·4ϫ10 9 /L (monocytes 0·4ϫ10 9 /L). A nasopharyngeal swab grew no pathogens.
 He was admitted to the SARS triage ward on March 13, and was started on oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice a day and levofloxacin 500 mg daily. Further blood tests showed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (platelets 61ϫ10 9 /L, D-dimer 630 ng/mL, prothrombin time 11·1s, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 43·3s). His white-cell count was 1·8ϫ10 9 /L (neutrophils 1·1ϫ10 9 /L, lymphocytes 0·5ϫ10 9 /L, and monocytes 0·2ϫ10 9 /L. His chest radiograph showed a prominent right hilum. CT of his thorax showed an ill-defined opacity with an air bronchogram in the apical posterior segment of the right lower lobe and diffusely in the right middle lobe. He was started on oral ribavirin 1·2 g thrice daily and intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg daily. His fever settled the next morning and his coagulopathy improved (APTT 40·7 s, platelet count 105ϫ10 9 /L, and D-dimer of 564 ng/mL). On March 19, 2003, oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg was started.
 On the evening of March 20, he had a fever of 38·9°C. His white blood cell count rose to 15·7ϫ10 9 /L (predominantly due to an increase in neutrophils). A secondary bacterial chest infection was suspected, and cefipime 2 g was given intravenously. Over the next 2 days he became increasingly breathless and his coagulopathy became worse (D-dimer 716 ng/mL, prothrombin time 11·9 s, platelets 199ϫ10 9 /L). The patient was given a single dose of methylprednisolone 500 mg intravenously and 4 L/min of oxygen. After this, he began to get better. Coagulation parameters returned to normal, he was weaned off of oxygen, and was discharged from hospital on March 31, 2003, on 0·3 mg/kg prednisolone and ribavirin 600 mg orally three times a day. On April 7, his chest radiograph showed worsening consolidation of the consolidation of the right middle zone and the prednisolone was increased to 0·5 mg/kg. This illness shows several characteristic features of SARS. There is often a break in the fever between the viraemic stage (days 1-3) and the lung inflammation phase of the illness. Patients who become apyrexial for several days still need up to 10 days of quarantine and follow-up. Haemorrhagic-fever-like illness with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy does occur but is usually mild. Although 78·3% of SARS patients in our centre had an abnormal chest radiographs when feverish, 3 some can have relatively normal radiographs. As shown in this case, a chest CT can show hidden pneumonic changes and facilitate a rapid diagnosis.",31388ba5c68c124d6a969d9d4a9ff694da8c6c2b,2003-05-03,"Wu, Eugene B; Sung, Joseph JY",The Lancet,10.1016/s0140-6736(03)13170-4,The Lancet,700.0,True,"In January, 2020, a novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was iden tified as the causative agent for a cluster of pneumonia cases initially detected in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China. 2 Phylogenetic data implicate a zoonotic origin, 3 and the rapid spread suggests ongoing personto-person transmission. 4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] However, substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding the transmissibility between humans, including the level of exposure to a confirmed case at which transmission is more likely to occur. This Article describes the first person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 in the USA, including the clinical and laboratory features of both patients and the assessment and monitoring of several hundred individuals with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Health-care personnel and community members with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 were interviewed using standardised contact questionnaires to assess exposure and whether the individual had true contact with a patient with COVID-19. We found 34 articles, of which 13 were primary reports of person-to-person transmission. None provided full details of the contact investigation and none were from North America. contacts (including those that could not be reached for active symptom monitoring) seeking care for fever, cough, or shortness of breath at an emergency department, the Illinois Department of Public Health used locally available, near real-time surveillance data received from regional acute care hospitals, which included symptom and diagnoses data and personally identifiable information for matching. For PUIs, specimens were collected and sent to CDC for testing. Specimens were collected per CDC guidance. There was no funding source for this study. Patient 1 is a female in her 60s who travelled to Wuhan on Dec 25, 2019, and returned to Illinois on Jan 13, 2020, and who was not symptomatic while travelling. On DOI 6, she sought care at an outpatient clinic for fever, fatigue, and cough and was hospitalised that day for pneumonia. Facemasks or other personal protective equipment (PPE) were not used at the home. When first interviewed as a contact on DOI 7, he reported no fever or change in chronic respiratory symptoms. Upon further interview of Patient 2's contacts, it was suggested that some non-specific symptoms might have started as early as DOI 3, with fatigue and worsening cough. On DOI 14, he reported new haemoptysis and worsening dyspnoea through active monitoring. He was promptly admitted to the hospital and placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). On hospital admission, vital signs, and physical examination for Patient 1 were within normal limits. For both patients, testing for other viral and bacterial respiratory infections was negative. Both patients recovered and were discharged to home isolation on DOI 23. Patient 2 was immediately evaluated and admitted to an AIIR and placed on Transmission-Based Precautions as described for Patient 1. Stool specimens collected for Patient 1 also remained positive longer than nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens; however, Patient 2 had no positive stool specimens. There were 25 people that had insufficient contact information to complete active monitoring. None of these individuals were found to have emergency department visits with fever, cough, or shortness of breath using near real-time surveillance data received from regional acute care hospitals for 14 days after their last exposure. Although the majority of monitored contacts (228 [66%] of 347) had low-risk exposures, 119 (34%) had exposures of medium risk or greater (table 2) . Patient 2 had 75 unique health-care personnel contacts and 71 unique community contacts, including 51 from outpatient waiting rooms. As a household contact, Patient 2 was the only community member who had a high-risk exposure. He became a PUI and subsequently the only other patient with COVID-19 in this investigation. All were negative for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of testing. Transmission occurred between close household contacts, from an index travel-associated case who subsequently transmitted the infection to her husband. Much like the first US case of COVID-19 in Washington, 20 both Illinois patients had mild-to-moderate illnesses that started with non-specific symptoms, making early identification difficult for patients, clinicians, and public health investigators. These factors have implications for detection of future cases. In the two Illinois patients, sputum specimens remained rtPCR-positive longer than other specimen types. These data are preliminary and subject to several limitations. Findings might not be generalisable or representative of broader transmission patterns. Fourth, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens collected on both PUIs and asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were collected at a single timepoint; a single negative SARS-CoV-2 rtPCR might not be sufficient to definitively rule out infection over a 14-day incubation period, and only a convenience sample of a minority of health-care personnel contacts were tested in this study, albeit weighted to capture those with higherrisk exposures. The absence of COVID-19 among healthcare personnel supports recommendations regarding appropriate infection control. 11 Given the difficulty in detecting new symptoms in patients with underlying lung disease, CDC recommends that clinicians considering a diagnosis of COVID-19 should discuss testing with public health departments on a case-by-case basis.

The 2014 Lancet Series on the new discipline of mass gatherings medicine was launched at the World Health Assembly of Ministers of Health in Geneva in May, 2014. The Series covered the planning and surveillance systems used to monitor public health risks, public health threats, and experiences of health-care providers from mass gathering events in 2012 and 2013. This follow-up Review focuses on the main public health issues arising from planned mass gathering events held between 2013 and 2018. We highlight public health and research data on transmission of infectious diseases and antibioticresistant bacteria, mass casualty incidents, and non-communicable diseases, including thermal disorders. In the events discussed in this Review, the combination of a large influx of people, many from countries with outbreakprone infectious diseases, with a high degree of crowd interactions imposed substantial burdens on host countries' health systems. The detection and transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in pilgrims attending the Kumbh Mela and the Hajj raise concern of possible globalisation from mass-gathering religious events. Priorities for further investments and opportunities for research into prevention, surveillance, and management of these public health issues are discussed.

Priorities for further investments and oppor tunities for research into prevention, surveillance, and management of communicable and noncom municable diseases, thermal disorders, and mass casualty incidents are discussed.","A mass gathering is defined by WHO as a planned or spontaneous event that gathers substantial numbers of attendees who might strain the health planning and response capacities of the host community, city, or country. 1 Mass gatherings can present important public health challenges related to the health of attendees and of the host country population and health services. 2 The concept of mass gathering medicine as a specialty emanated from discourse on the 2009 Hajj, which was held during the 2009 HIN1 influenza pandemic (panel 1). 3 The first International Conference on Mass Gatherings Medicine was held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in October, 2010, where The Lancet Infectious Diseases Series on mass gatherings was launched (panel 1). 4 This conference led to a coalition of experts from virtual WHO mass gathering collaborating centres and global academic and public health faculty 5 to guide develop ment of, and update, optimal public health and medical prevention and treatment guidelines at mass gathering events. 6, 7 Mass gathering medicine as a new discipline was highlighted at the World Health Assembly of Ministers of Health in Geneva in May, 2014, where The Lancet Series on mass gathering medicine was launched. 7 These stateoftheart reviews covered the planning and surveillance systems used to monitor public health risks, public health threats, and experiences of health care providers from three mass gathering events: the London 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, 8 the 2012 Union of European Football Associations European Championship finals, 9 and the Hajj pilgrimages of 2012 and 2013. 10 They set out the planning and surveillance systems used to monitor public health risks and described existing and potential public health threats (panel 2) and the experiences of healthcare providers.
 Since the launch of The Lancet Series in 2014, various public health threats have continued to pose public health challenges for the planning of events and during events at various mass gathering events. This followup Review focuses on the main public health issues arising from planned religious, sporting, scouting, cultural, and musical mass gathering events held between 2013 and 2018: the Kumbh Mela 2013 and 2016 pilgrimages in India, the 12th Festival of Pacific Arts, the UN's Third Conference on Small Island Developing States, and the Micronesian Games in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup, the 23rd World Scout Jamboree in Japan in 2015, and the annual Hajj pilgrimages of 2015, 2016, and 2017 in Saudi Arabia. We highlight public health and research data on transmission of infectious diseases, emergence of antibioticresistant bacteria, mass casualty incidents arising from stampedes and terrorist attacks, and noncommunicable diseases, including heatrelated
 The Kumbh Mela, the Hindu religious pilgrimage festival, is the largest mass gathering event in the world, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] it attracts more than 120 million pilgrims from across the world for up to 2 months, and is held every 3 years alternately along the banks of four holy rivers: the Ganga, or Ganges, River (Haridwar district), Godavari River (Nasik district), Kshipra River (Ujjain district), and Sangam River (Prayag district, Allahabad) at a confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati. The 2013 Kumbh Mela event was attended by 70 million Hindu pilgrims over 55 days at the confluence of the Yamuna and Ganga Rivers. 19 The Kumbh Mela is a highly coordinated and organised event, where WHO recomendations for mass gatherings are implemented (panel 3). 1, 2 The Indian Government and local authorities plan well ahead of each Kumbh Mela event and have established plans for physical and public health infrastructure to be in place. Socalled temporary popup cities that include tents for pilgrims, water pipelines and clean water supply, toilets, sanitation and sewage disposal facilities, vector control and sur veillance teams, security services, and administrative assistance for pilgrims are set up along the river. [20] [21] [22] A range of healthcare facilities are put in place and hospitals are prepared to receive pilgrims requiring inpatient treatment and intensive care for every Kumbh Mela festival. 21 Internal roads and pontoon bridges are built for these popup cities and are designed to streamline and facilitate pilgrim crowd movement and flow. 22 State government irrigation and water resources departments and the Central Pollution Control Board work closely together to increase the capacity of sewage treatment plants and to ensure sufficient flow to remove contamination by releasing water into rivers. 19, 20 90 000 kL/day of potable water were supplied for the 2013 Kumbh Mela for drinking and cooking, with 550 km of water pipelines were laid for distribution through 20 000 taps. 19 Approximately 45 000 toilets were provided, although there was little health promotion messaging. 21 Similarly to other mass gatherings, random inspection and vaccinations were done for immunocompromised individuals. 21
 The Kumbh Mela is unique in that it involves frequent and prolonged bathing by pilgrims in the holy river, a ritual which is believed to break the cycle of reincarnations and convey immortality. 17, 18 Contamination of river water with faeces, urine, saliva, and sputa is inevitable and leads to transmission of waterborne and respiratory tract infections. 12, 14, 20, 21 A notable example of such a cycle of transmission is the 1817-24 Asia cholera pandemic, which was associated with the Kumbh Mela. 23 urination. 21 Bacterial load in the river increased by approximately 130 fold. 12, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] At the 2013 Kumbh Mela, a study 15,16,20 that followed 30 000 pilgrims in four sector hospitals found a 5% incidence of diarrhoeal diseases over a 23day period. A rise in nonbloody diarrhoea cases was seen just 2 days after the main bathing day on Jan 29, 2013, and a peak in upper respiratory tract infections coincided with the peak in nonbloody diarrhoeal disease. The use by pilgrims of fires fuelled by cow dung or firewood resulted in more than 23% seeking cough medicine and smoke from choolahs using wood or coal was the commonest cause of respiratory illnesses among 15 000 patients. 13 The observation that a socalled shaving ritual could increase the risk of bloodborne disease transmission has not yet been confirmed, because the practice is surrounded by secrecy and there is little of information on how widespread it is. 13
 The presence of extendedspectrum βlactamasepro ducing Escherichia coli in municipal sewer systems and waste water in Hyderabad, India, have sparked concerns that antibioticresistant bacteria could be spreading at massgathering religious events. 26 The rivers of India are known to be polluted owing to inadequately treated household and industrial effluents. 26, 27, 29 A 20 times increase in blaNDM-1 gene carrying bacteria during the pilgrimage on the bank of the Ganges was observed during the 2015 Kumbh Mela. 27 A novel antibioticresistant bacterial species, Corynebacterium godavarianum, has been isolated from the bathing site of the Godavari River. 25 In response to this growing global concern, 28 an expert panel concluded that use of antibiotics should be restricted to acute travellers whose diarrhoea is incapacitating. 30
 Since the stampede at the Kumbh Mela in 2015, 22 the risk of crush injuries, stampedes, and other mass casualty incidents, such as fires, have been minimised by close surveillance and constant evaluation of crowd flow. Site preparation and negotiations with the various akharas (sects) to predetermine the order of ritual baths has resulted in a reduction in the number of deaths due to stampedes from about 500 people in 1954 to 37 in 2015 (table). 22
 The Festival of Pacific Arts and the Micronesian Games are a feature of PICTs. 38, 39 Although several of the event host countries have a population under 200 000, such as Yap State (population 11 000) in the Federated States of Micronesia that hosted the 9th Micronesia games in July 2018, the health security risks remain the same, and can be proportionally greater, than similar events in larger countries, due to the influx of people and its effect on the fragile health infrastructure of PICTs. Three enhanced surveillance activities for mass gathering events in PICTs occurred during national or regional disease outbreaks that had the potential to severely affect the mass gatherings, place greater strain on health services, and cause substantial tourismrelated economic and reputation loss.
 The Eighth Micronesian Games took place in Pohnpei State, Federated States of Micronesia, in July, 2014. 38 Pohnpei is a small island state of around 36 000 people in the western Pacific. The Games attracted about 1700 athletes and officials from several Micronesian countris and territories. In June, 2014, 6 weeks before the opening of the Games, Pohnpei reported the first case of measles in an outbreak that spanned the duration of the Games and the following 3 months and resulted in a total of 251 cases. 40 The UN's Third Conference on Small Island Developing States was held in Apia, Samoa on Sept 1-4, 2014. 41 Attracting more than 3000 delegates from 115 countries, it was the largest event ever to be hosted by Samoa, a Polynesian island nation in the south Pacific with a population of around 187 000. In late July, 2014, an extensive chikungunya virus disease outbreak began in Samoa that resulted in more than 4000 cases 4 months later. 42 The 12th Festival of Pacific Arts was hosted by the Micronesian island of Guam (population 163 000) in 2016. 43 The Festival was a large event, attracting more than 2500 artists and performers from 27 countries and territories across the Pacific. These island communities (some very small, such as the Pitcairn Islands with fewer than 50 residents) would have been greatly affected by the introduction of a novel disease. The Festival was held Panel 3: Key considerations related to communicable disease alert, response, and operation plans for mass gatherings • Risk assessment and management, surveillance and alert systems, and outbreak alert and response twinned to effective communication strategies • Rapid identification of attendees with communicable diseases and their contacts for potential quarantining and instituting preventive infection control measures • Medical care planning and guidelines (preventive medicine, mandatory vaccinations, food management, water and waste management, and identification of physical and fire hazards) • Public health measures (water protection and provision, food protection and provision, and syndromic surveillance) • Emergency planning and response (rapid access to injured or ill patients, provision of triage in the field and at aid stations, provision of on-site care for minor injuries and illnesses, effective and timely stabilisation and transport of patients requiring evacuation) • Disaster medicine, trauma, and triage and level of care • Mobile units, health stations, and designated hospitals • Use of modern technologies for proactive surveillance, early diagnosis and rapid detection, data collection, analyses, sharing, and communication. • Updating travel guidelines, including vaccinations, for each specific mass gathering event while Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and measles outbreaks were occurring in several participating countries. 40, 42, 44, 45 At all these mass gathering events, the combination of large influxes of people and high degrees of social mixing in the presence of highly infectious pathogens, emerging nonvaccinepreventable diseases, and diseases with incurable long term consequences (eg, Zika birth defects) could have introduced substantial population burdens and consequences for health systems. To counter these threats, enhanced surveillance for these mass gathering events was essential to ensure health security. 41, 46 The three events used enhanced syndromic surveillance that built on the existing panPacific WHOled weekly syndromic surveillance, 47 ensuring host countries were prepared. However, although short, the period of intense activity that characterises mass gathering surveillance is a substantial burden to stretched local public health resources. To alleviate this burden additional support was gained from within host countries and from external partners provided by the Pacific Community, which has extensive experience of mass gathering surveillance, and the Pacific Island Health Officers Association.
 Massgathering surveillance in the Pacific has shown the value of a strong foundation in existing disease surveillance and of regional partnerships. These two aspects were essential in host countries' ability to implement comprehensive and intensive massgathering surveillance. However, although the benefit of early warning disease surveillance was established, longer term sustainable surveillance improvements were harder to realise. For example, local public health departments borrowed personnel from other departments and external support, all of whom returned to their previous duties once the massgathering surveillance finished.
 The massgathering surveillance was successful 46,47 on all three occasions and showed that even small nations can (with the right support) provide health security in the face of substantial health risks. In doing so, these events proved the value of the mass gathering surveillance in providing health security assurance to event organisers, participants, and local and regional communities as well as showing that small island nations can meet International Health Regulations requirements and implement enhanced massgathering surveillance.
 Various public health concerns were raised before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics and Paralympics in August, 2016. [48] [49] [50] [51] In February, 2016, WHO declared the Zika virus a public health emergency of international concern owing to the Zika outbreak in Brazil and its association with birth defects. 50 There was global pressure for the Games to be either postponed or moved to another country. 52 The WHO Emergency Committee on Zika virus decided that postponing or cancelling the Games had no public health justification, [49] [50] [51] 53 stating that ""indi vidual risks in areas of transmission are the same whether or not a mass gathering is conducted, and can be minimised by good public health measures"". 50 Because Brazil is a dengueendemic country, the risk of dengue to nonimmune visitors was also a concern, 54 based on the experience from a pilgrimage in Senegal 55 and from GeoSentinel data. GeoSentinel is a global network of travel medicine providers focused on sentinel surveillance, which generates evidencebased assessments of infectious disease risks for attendees of future mass gatherings events. 56, 57 As with the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics in London, 18 WHO provided technical support to the Brazilian Ministry of Health and International Olympic Committee to ensure public health safety during the Games. This support included improving the quality of water for recreation and preventing the spread of Zika virus by increasing vector control efforts. In spite of intensive media coverage, no cases of Zika virus were confirmed among people who attended, both during the Games and since returning to their home countries. 50 gathering events during infectious disease outbreaks with epidemic potential. 60 Before the 2016 Summer Olympics, another concern was related to water sports and athletes being exposed to polluted waters. 61 However, a study 61 done during tests in 2015 showed no increased incidence of diarrhoea among exposed individuals compared with controls. When travellers to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil were compared with other travellers to Brazil during the same period, the majority in both groups were bitten by insects and had sunburns as environmental risk factors, and every third traveller suffered from diarrhoea. 58, 61 Men travelling to the World Cup tended to have more sexual contacts outside of a relationship than a control group of other travellers to Brazil and also had more alcohol intake. 48
 The 2018 FIFA World Cup was hosted by Russia between June 14 and July 15, 2018. 62 The event was attended by 3 million people with 32 international teams participating in 64 football matches in 12 stadiums across 11 cities: Ekaterinburg, Kaliningrad, Kazan, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, RostovonDon, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, and Volgograd. 62 Data from WHO's Regional Office for Europe 62 showed that the Russian Federation had reported 454 isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples from urban tertiary care hospitals across the country before the event. Carba penem resistance occurred in 74% of Acinetobacter spp isolates, 49% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, and 12% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. 23% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillinresistant and 91% of K pneumoniae isolates were resistant to third generation cephalosporins. Although no reported major public health incidences were reported, the 2018 FIFA World Cup created heightened awareness of the threat of the transmission and globalisation of antibioticresistant bacteria. No crosssectional or longitudinal cohort studies from the event have been published.
 The 23rd World Scout Jamboree was hosted by Japan between July 28 and Aug 8, 2015, and was attended by 33 000 scouts of up to 17 years of age from 162 countries. 63 The World Scout Jamboree is an international Scout Movement camp. It takes place every 4 years, with the site of the Jamboree rotating between continents. The daily schedule includes arduous activities, such as climbing, woodchopping, and knife handling, and preparing one's own meals on gas stoves. Apart from risk of transmission of infectious diseases, injuries, and burns, it induces a range of psychological disorders, inc luding homesickness and behavioural and neuropsychological disorders. 64 No major infectious diseases outbreaks were reported during the Jamboree. However, within 9 days of the end of the event, six cases of laboratoryconfirmed invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitides capsular serogroup W occurred among scouts and their close contacts in Scotland and Sweden. [65] [66] [67] Soon after return to Scotland, three scouts and one relative were diagnosed with invasive meningo coccal disease. These cases were all associated with one scout unit. Two confirmed cases of invasive meningo coccal disease were reported from Sweden. 65 Molecular analysis [65] [66] [67] showed that the same N meningitides isolates were responsible for the six cases and that they belonged to the ST11 clonal complex, which is usually associated with large outbreaks. No other cases were reported from scouts who attended from other European countries or Japan. All participants were made aware of the outbreak and of signs and symptoms of invasive meningococcal disease through an information campaign and were offered ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis. 66, 67 To make a decision on the need for prophylactic treatment for close contacts of returning scouts, throat or nasopharyngeal swabs from participants receiving antibiotic prophylaxis were taken. The carrier state in Swedish teenagers was studied comparing sensitivity of throat versus nasopharyngeal swabs from 1020 of the 1890 Swedish teenagers who participated in the Jamboree. The overall positivity for N meningitidis in this group was 83 (8%) of 1020, of which 61 were nongroupable. 67 Further car riage studies are required during mass gatherings to determine the epidemiology and association between carrier isolates and diseasecausing isolates in the population and the dynamics of globali sation from mass gathering events.
 Every year an increasing number of people travel to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. 68 The total number of pilgrims for both the Hajj and Umrah is about 10 million pilgrims annually from more than 180 countries. The Hajj pilgrimages that took place in 2015, 2016, and 2017 each attracted more than 2 million people from outside Saudi Arabia. 68 Several major public health challenges are associated with each Hajj, 10 in cluding transmission of infectious diseases, exacerbation of noncommunicable diseases, mental health disorders, and stampedes (appendix), among others. Infectious diseases surveillance systems are operational during the annual Hajj, and they have evolved from paperbased reporting tools to automated electronic systems, re cording and storing large datasets, and reporting from mobile units, clinics, primary health facilities, and hospitals that serve pilgrims. 10 All these data are fed directly to a central command and control unit, enabling rapid amalgamation and analyses of data and necessary public health interventions. These advances in realtime surveillance have improved public health security for the mass gatherings at the Hajj. 69 See Online for appendix
 In the past 5 years, concern has grown with regard to the threat to global health security posed by several emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. Because of the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa (2013-16), 69 74 concerns were expressed by the global public health fraternity regarding pilgrims from affected countries travelling to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj or Umrah. 70 The Saudi government implemented restrictions only to countries affected by the Ebola outbreak. For pilgrims from Yemen and other countries, intensified screening at points of entry into Saudi Arabia and close surveillance during their stay throughout the Hajj, was implemented, with no cases detected. 68 At the 2016 Hajj, The Indian Medical Mission provided health care to about 400 000 pilgrim patients from August to October, 2016, through a team of 144 doctors, including 50 specialists, 146 paramedics, and 74 ancillary staff. 75 They coordinated a tiered healthcare network, including primarycare static clinics, tent clinics, and mobile medical task forces, secondarycare hospitals, and referral and evacuation capabilities at Mecca, Medina, and Jeddah. Secondarycare referral hospitals catered for critical care, internal medicine, general surgery, ortho paedics, gynaecology, paediatrics, psychiatry, dermatology, isolation, lab medicine, and radiology. Infectious diseases consituted 53% of outpatient diagnoses, with upper and lower respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and diabetes related severe infections, particularly cellulitis and pneumonia the most common. Urinary tract infections were common in female pilgrims. 75 Nearly all pilgrims develop a respiratory tract infection during the Hajj, known as the pilgrims' cough. 10 Overcrowding during the Hajj increases the risk of transmission of respiratory pathogens, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), rhino virus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A H1N1, influenza B, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, meta pneumovirus, enterovirus, multidrugresistant tu ber culosis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ebola, MERSCoV, Alkhumra viral haemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever have high outbreak potential during Hajj. 10, 76, 77 Although the threat of coronaviruses (MERSCoV and severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus) with epidemic potential remains, [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] no cases of MERSCoV have yet been identified in pilgrims during Hajj or upon return to their home countries. 79 Other corona viruses identified at the Hajj include alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, of which the 229E strain is most common cause of upper respiratory tract illnesses. 82 A systematic review of 31 studies on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in Hajj pilgrims 76 showed influenza, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza continue to be the most common viral infections among pilgrims. At the 2016 Hajj, a study 83 of 266 pilgrims admitted to hospitals with community acquired pneumonia showed that 96 (36%) cases had diabetes, 26 (10%) were smokers, and 108 (45%) cases required intensive care. 48 (18%) cases had invasive S pneumoniae (pneumococcal) infection.
 Every year the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health issues updates on travel immunisation recommendations for pilgrims. 10 They are classified as mandatory (required) and voluntary (recommended) before performing Hajj and Umrah. The three mandatory vaccines are the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine for all pilgrims and the Yellow fever and Polio vaccines for pilgrims coming from countries with active polio transmission. 10, 68 Recom mended vaccines include influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine. 84, 85 Since the inclusion of the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine in 2001, 85 no major meningo coccal meningitis outbreaks related to hajj have been identified. [85] [86] [87] However, concern that new serogroups of N meningitidis (eg, B and X), which are not covered in the current quadrivalent vaccine targeting serogroups A, C, W135, and Y, could be a cause of future epidemics is increasing. 88, 89 Owing to the high incidence of pertussis seen among Hajj pilgrims in 2003, 90 Bordetella pertussis is considered a risk in pilgrims, especially those who have not completed their immuni sation schedule. 91 Tuberculosis is the commonest cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide. 37 A large percentage of Hajj pilgrims come from high tuberculosisendemic coun tries. The burden of undiagnosed active pulmonary tuberculosis in pilgrims attending the 2015 Hajj from five high tuberculosisendemic countries was evaluated by a study randomly screening 1164 pilgrims, 36 of which 15 had previously undiagnosed active pulmonary tuberculosis. With millions of pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia from high tuberculosis endemic areas, cases of undiagnosed active pulmonary tuberculosis will continue to pose a risk to other pilgrims. Further studies are required to define the scale of the tuberculosis during the Hajj and to develop proactive screening, treatment, and prevention guidelines. 92 Several studies also done on enteric pathogens during the Hajj show the emergence of antibioticresistant bacteria (appendix). 33, 34, 93 To prevent emergence of and spread of antibioticresistant bacteria, antibiotic pre scription and consumption by pilgrims at mass gathering events should be rationalised and regulated. Antibiotic stewardship and good prescribing practices should be promoted amongst healthcare providers.
 Noncommunicable diseases constitute a large burden on health services at the Hajj. 10, 68, 94 They include diabetes, respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, renal failure, chronic obstructive airways disease, prostate hypertrophy and urine retention, thyroid disorders, strokes, neuropsychiatric disorders, heatrelated disorders, traumatic injuries, ear, nose, and throat disorders, and eye ailments. The Indian Medical Mission studied 495 Indian pilgrims admitted for intensive care management during the 2016 Hajj and found that 262 (53%) had respiratory tract infections (53%) and 199 (24%) had traumatic injuries. 68 Risk factors associated with high morbidity were old age and preexisting comorbidities. A substantial number of pilgrims participating in the Hajj are elderly with preexisting chronic medical conditions. 10,75,95 These pilgrims might be unable to cope with the arduous rituals condensed into a 5day period and thus exacerbation of existing noncommunicable diseases occurs. 95
 In contrast to mass gathering religious events, sport and music concerts 96 attract younger individuals of 15-25 years of age. Excessive alcohol consumption and recreational drug use increases the risk of intoxication and injury, extreme behaviours, such as fire jumping (jumping and dancing through flames), 97 sexual activity resulting in transmission of sexually transmitted disease and sexual assault. Additionally, loud noise at music festivals can lead to deafness, hence legislation is needed to keep to certain noise thresholds. 96
 At mass gathering events the threat of mass casualty incidents from crush injuries due to stampedes, fires, accidents (eg, airplane crashes, motor vehicles, boat collisions, crane collapse), structural failures (eg, building or bridges collapses, terrorist attacks, and toxic exposures) is ever present, and their occurrences are unpredictable. Several mass casualty incidents have occurred between 2015 and 2018 (table; appendix).
 For example, during the 2015 Hajj pilgrimage, two major disasters occurred, resulting in deaths of pilgrims (table) . The first occurred on Sept 11, 2015, in which a crane being used for construction to expand the area around the Grand Mosque (Masjid alHaram) in Mecca toppled over, killing 107 people and injuring 394. 31 The victims were from 12 countries. The second, on Sept 24, 2015, was a major stampede that occurred in Mina at the intersection leading up to the Jamaraat Bridge. This incident resulted in crush injuries and suffocation, with 769 pilgrim deaths and 934 injured. 32
 Owing to the sudden and unexpected nature of mass casualty incidents, they pose major challenges to health services. Preparations for mass casualty incidents are mandated by the WHO and followed by the organising authorities. When these incidences occur, local investi gations and reviews are done to assess the underlying factors leading to the mass casualty incident, assess the effectiveness of the response, and identify lessons for inclusion in future mass gathering planning. 93, [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] Training and simulation exercises for healthcare workers in management of mass casualties and injuries should be done to assess preparedness and identify areas for improvement.
 A 30year literature review 100 of 290 mass casualty events at mass gatherings showed that the most frequent mechanism of injury involved the movement of people under crowded conditions (162 [56%] of 290). Organisers of the Kumbh Mela and Hajj have used experiences of their mass casualty incidents to identify improvements to reduce risk at future events (appendix).
 The Saudi Arabian Government has also put in place measure to reduce mordbidity and mortality from heat related disorders during the Hajj, as has the Japanese Government for the upcoming Olympics (appendix). mandatory and optional vaccines for prevention of infections are issued by local public health authorities and WHO. Occasionally authorities in countries of origin face hurdles in the implementation of these measures 87, 108 or issues regarding reduced immunogenicity of vaccines owing to interactions between vaccines. 109 Although no global outbreaks of meningococcal disease have occurred after the Hajj for decades, a high level of awareness of the possibility of outbreaks at all mass gatherings remains. 87, [110] [111] [112] Increasingly, attention is being focused on vaccinepreventable diseases, such as cholera, polio, measles, and pertussis, which are increasing in the eastern Mediterranean owing to conflict and large refugee populations with poor access to preventive public health services. 113 The highly lethal MERSCoV causes increasing concern, as it continues to circulate in Saudi Arabia 78, 79 and remains in the top ten of the WHO Research and Development Blueprint list of infectious diseases likely to cause major epidemics (appendix). 112
 More countryspecific religious mass gathering events exist that attract smaller numbers of pilgrims from neighbouring countries or overseas. Several religious mass gatherings occur on a yearly basis in Iraq, drawing millions of pilgrims from across the country. The Arbaeen is one of the largest, during which pilgrims from Iraqi provinces visit the holy shrine in Karbala, and poses major public health challenges. 114 In West Africa, each year up to 5 million Muslim pilgrims from the Mouride community in Senegal, and from neighbouring countries, assemble in the holy city of Touba in Senegal for the Grand Magal religious pilgrimage, 115 the largest religious mass gathering in West Africa. This pilgrimage attracts individuals from outside Africa and has the potential for globalisation of local endemic infectious diseases. 115 Research on communicable diseases and non communicable diseases, including heatrelated disorders and disasters, with a more collaborative approach between local and international researchers and organisers of mass gathering events is required. The creation of the Africa Centres for Diseases Control (Africa CDC) on Jan 31, 2017, in Addis Ababa by the African Union, with five regional CDCs in Gabon, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Zambia, 116 creates major opportunities for improving coordination and public health capacitybuilding initiatives in partner ship with organisers of sporting and religious mass gathering events. For example, the majority of the live stock for ritual sacrifices during the Hajj are exported from Africa to the Middle East-the One Human EnvironmentalAnimal Health approach 101, 117, 118 should be adopted in partnership with Africa CDC. This initiative should aim to define the risk and threats to global health security and help reduce the risk of outbreaks and spread of zoonotic infections, such as Rift Valley fever, MERS CoV, Ebola, and other viral haemorrhagic fevers, across Mass gathering events provide unique opportunities for crosscontinental multidisciplinary collaborations on public health and basic science research, which will allow for the development of a strong evidence base for public health planning and health services at mass gatherings (panel 5). Although the formalisation of mass gatherings medicine has led to an increase in research studies into the specific health issues affecting pilgrims at the Hajj, they have not been forthcoming for the Kumbh Mela and other mass gatherings. Research output from mass gathering events is focused on small studies of pilgrims from individual countries and the data are not generalisable and no outputs have changed global policy. A need remains for more coordinated action by a global coalition of interested partners to share experiences from various mass gathering events, gather and translate appropriate evidence base into public health policy, and push for the best health promotion and educational policies. The creation of a mass gathering medicine specialist society or formal network, with a dedicated journal, might generate more frequent dialogue and enhance international collaborations on mass gathering medicine. A need also remains for high quality studies that are appropriately designed and adequately powered using participants from several geographical regions to provide data that stand up to rigorous scientific review. Advances in technology and closer monitoring of pilgrims at the Hajj provide an opportunity for large cohort studies of attendees of mass gathering events. These studies could focus on infectious diseases priorities, inc luding neglected tropical diseases, 119 noncom municable diseases, mental health, and heatrelated disorders (panels 4 and 5). The widespread availability of next generation sequencing, genotyping and phenotyping, and other molecular methods also provides an opportunity for analyses of health risks among large population cohorts and for appropriate research to obtain an evidence base for the production of WHOapproved guidelines, which will be useful for countries that host mass gathering events.
 Structured, realtime interoperable surveillance and reporting systems are required for active surveillance of communicable and noncommunicable diseases during mass gatherings. 120 Given the continuing threat of new emerging and reemerging infectious diseases with epidemic potential, regularly recurring mass gathering events, can act as important global sentinel surveillance platforms. 120 Additionally, diseases targeted by WHO for elimination, such as polio, are still endemic in some countries from where individuals attending mass gathering events originate, offering opportunities for research and evalu ation of public health portfolios. 121 Increased investments in the field of mass gathering medicine are required to obtain an accurate evidence base for the development of accurate prevention, management, and control guide lines and optimal public health services to protect the health of attendees of mass gatherings and of host country populations.

During the past two decades, overall mortality from infectious causes decreased, with notable decreases recorded for lower respiratory tract infections and diarrhoeal diseases. 1 The eff ect of these diseases varies greatly by geographical area and populations, with low-income countries most aff ected. In the 1990s and early 2000s, substantial complementary investments were made to build similar, multilevel capacity against bioterrorism threats. For each US birth cohort receiving recommended childhood immunisations, around 20 million illnesses and more than 40 000 deaths are prevented, which results in about US$70 billion savings in direct and societal costs. Vaccination against HPV, the most common STI in the USA, 13 has been recommended for preteens and young adults since 2006 for girls 14 and since 2011 for boys. One of the two available vaccines also protects against genital warts. 19 These cases emphasise the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage and ensuring appropriate messaging for travellers. Such cases can also present specifi c concerns for health-care settings. 20 Containment of measles outbreaks requires substantial public health resources. Estimated public health costs from two 2011 outbreaks in Utah aff ecting 13 people exceeded $330 000. 21 In 2006, the largest US outbreak of mumps in two decades was reported, with 6584 cases-most from eight mid-western states and colleges. Although the need for a third-dose of mumps-containing vaccine to be given during outbreaks and for the development of an improved vaccine has been discussed, the benefi t of these additional strategies is unclear. However, in the mid-2000s, illness in children and teens began to rise despite high vaccination rates, which prompted new recommendations for a pertussis booster (Tdap) in teenagers. 25 Even with these new recommendations, pertussis rates have continued to increase, with substantial outbreaks in California in 2010, 26 and in Washington State in 2011-12. 27 A retrospective study 28 in California showed that waning immunity from the acellular vaccines was the probable cause of disease resurgence. Research is in progress to improve defi nitions for predictors of immunity and to strengthen control eff orts. 29
 Every year, around one in fi ve patients acquires an HAI in US hospitals. Investigations of HAI-related outbreaks can provide important information for improvements in infection control. 34 Outbreaks have also occurred from contaminated products including those prepared in compounding pharmacies. Identifi cation of patients colonised by or infected with CRE and segregation of patients and staff can reduce these infections, 49 but additional steps are needed. Additional eff orts include enhanced surveillance and laboratory networks with advanced molecular diagnostic capacities to improve detection, characterisation, and control of these infections. 50 In 2012, two notable outbreaks of zoonotic diseases in the USA were caused by Sin Nombre virus-the causative agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome-that was carried by deer mice infesting cabins in Yosemite National Park 51 and by a variant swine infl uenza virus carried by pigs exhibited at agricultural fairs. Mosquito-borne illnesses are particularly unpredictable and diffi cult to control. 67 In addition to WNV, dengue fever, the most prevalent vector-borne viral disease in the world, is resurging globally, aff ecting millions of people, including in Asia (70% of all cases, worldwide), Africa (16%), and the Americas (14%). 70 The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and CDC are working to strengthen dengue control in the Americas and to ensure public heath preparedness for detection and control of exotic mosquito-borne diseases. 74 Additional areas endemic for Lyme disease occur along the Pacifi c coast. 76, 77 This tick feeds on dogs at every stage of its life cycle and usually lives in and around homes. CDC, the Arizona Department of Health Services, the Indian Health Service, and tribal health departments are working to test a prevention and vector control strategy for Rocky Mountain spotted fever that includes homeowner education, use of acaricides, tick collaring, and control of the local dog population. 80 Public health eff orts to reduce illness and deaths from zoonotic and vector-borne diseases focus on improvements to disease surveillance, public health education, treatment, and prevention, and on actions to sustain and strengthen vector control programmes. In 2011, CDC investigated about 30 major multistate outbreaks. These increases in frequency, however, could partly be a result of improved detection, surveillance, and typing methods for foodborne infections. 87, 88 The rate of Salmonella infections-the most commonly reported foodborne infection-has been largely unchanged. 86 An important component in eff orts to identify and stop foodborne disease outbreaks is PulseNet, a national network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories that use pulsed-fi eld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns to identify clusters of foodborne illnesses that might signal an outbreak. Produce accounted for almost half of all foodborne illnesses from these outbreaks, with most deaths caused by meat and poultry. 90 Although these tests have great potential for broader applications in detection and control of infectious diseases, the increased use of cultureindependent diagnostics brings new challenges to public health laboratory-based surveil lance systems that rely on culture and bacterial isolates for strain identifi cation. 98 For example, young people are less likely to have their infection diagnosed or have viral suppression compared with other age groups. 99 CDC's eff orts to advance the NHAS goals are focused on the combination of evidenced-based, cost-eff ective, and scalable prevention interventions for geographical areas and populations with the greatest burden of HIV. 102 Nearly half these infections occur in young people (aged 15-24 years). 103, 105 Guidelines to treat gonorrhoea have been changed to preserve the last available eff ective treatment option for as long as possible. 109 Many people with chronic hepatitis do not know that they are infected, which increases their risk for cirrhosis or liver cancer and for unknowingly transmitting infection. 119 Although more pressing globally, management of tuberculosis and HIV co-infection and surveillance for drug resistance are important components of tuberculosis control eff orts in the USA. The FDA accelerated approval of bedaquiline, a novel drug for the treatment of pulmonary MDR tuberculosis. Inherent in these eff orts are well established links between clinical, public health, and research communities working with non-traditional partners such as industry, law enforcement, businesses, and the media. Although at their core these collaborations need to be established locally, such crucial partnerships have to extend across state, national, and international levels. Together, these alliances can form a global infrastructure and system to detect and control infectious diseases. The latest surge in health communications has come from social media tools, which are increasingly being used to extend the reach of public health information."

 Methods We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2.
 Interpretation SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions. Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of widespread transmission in the community.

 www.thelancet.com Published online March 16, 2020 https://doi.","On Dec 31, 2019, a cluster of viral pneumonia cases, subsequently identified as coronavirus disease 2019 , was reported in Wuhan, China. 1 Subsequent reports suggested that community transmission had occurred in Wuhan and Hubei province, leading to the lockdown of Wuhan on Jan 23, 2020, and subsequently other cities in Hubei province, to control COVID-19 spread. 2,3 WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on Jan 30, 2020. 4 As of March 6, 2020, 98 192 confirmed cases and 3380 deaths were reported globally, including 17 481 cases and 335 deaths from 88 regions or countries outside of mainland China. 5 Singapore, a city-state in southeast Asia, developed casedefinitions, laboratory tests, and enhanced surveillance to detect affected individuals with COVID-19 early, to enable containment of the disease. Singapore confirmed its first imported case of COVID-19 from Wuhan on Jan 23, 2020. 6 With the lockdown of Wuhan, inbound flights from Wuhan to Singapore had ceased since Jan 23, 2020. As of Feb 22, 2020, 89 people in Singapore were confirmed to have COVID-19, and the first 18 affected individuals all reported recent travel to Wuhan. Singapore identified several local clusters of COVID-19, with the first three linked to a tour group from China, a company conference, and a church.
 To contain the spread of COVID-19, several pertinent questions need to be addressed. What is the infect iousness of cases? What are the settings and activities beyond family clusters where spread can occur? What measures should be taken to improve surveillance and casedetection? What measures can reduce disease spread? To answer these questions, we report data for the first three clusters of COVID-19 cases in Singapore, the epidemi ological and clinical investigations done to ascertain disease characteristics and exposure types, and summary statistics to characterise the incubation period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the serial interval between trans mission pairs. Our findings will be important for countries and cities to calibrate detection and response efforts during the ongoing epidemic.
 Since Jan 2, 2020, the Ministry of Health in Singapore has been refining local case-definitions for people suspected of having COVID-19 (appendix p 4). Doctors are required by law to notify the Ministry of Health of cases of COVID-19. 7 Further, Singapore implemented enhanced surveillance on Jan 31, 2020, to test for COVID-19 among patients in intensive care units and people who died of unknown cause, all people with pneumonia in hospitals, and individuals with influenzalike illness in sentinel primary-care clinics. Hospitalbased doctors also have permission to test patients who they view with suspicion for clinical or epidemiological reasons. A confirmed case of COVID-19 is defined as an individual with a respiratory sample positive for SARS-CoV-2, using a laboratory-based PCR test (appendix p 1). Phylogenetic analysis is done of available viral genomic sequences to ascertain genetic clustering.
 The Ministry of Health in Singapore identified the first three clusters of COVID-19 cases on Feb 3, 2020, Feb 5, 2020, and Feb 8, 2020. All epidemiological investigations and outbreak containment measures were implemented under the Infectious Diseases Act, 7 which provides for use of data for analysis to control outbreaks.
 We interviewed people with confirmed COVID-19 to obtain data for demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and activity patterns, from 14 days preceding symptom onset until isolation in hospital. We initiated contact tracing to identify close contacts (ie, people who spend a prolonged time within 2 m of a confirmed case) and other contacts who had some interactions with the case. We asked people with confirmed COVID-19 about possible contact with confirmed cases reported overseas in the 14 days before symptom onset. We used open source information from other countries (including government websites), news aggregators (eg, ProMed), and media reports to identify secondary transmissions in the respective clusters. For each cluster, we investigated the implicated setting to ascertain potential interactions. We reviewed activity maps of other confirmed cases in Singapore to identify potential epidemiological links to each cluster.
 We placed close contacts under quarantine for 14 days from last exposure to the individual with confirmed COVID-19, either at home or at designated government quarantine facilities. We monitored their health status daily; people who developed symptoms were conveyed in dedicated ambulances to hospital for isolation and testing as part of active case-finding. We video-called individuals who were quarantined at home three times a day to verify their location; quarantine violators were tagged with a continuous tracking device. We placed other contacts (depending on risk stratification) on phone surveillance or advised them to self-monitor and visit a primary-care clinic if they became unwell.
 We isolated people with confirmed COVID-19 in indi vidual negative-pressure rooms with anterooms. We did blood investigations including a complete blood count, renal and liver function tests, and amounts of C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment was mainly supportive; we started some patients on oral lopinavir (400 mg) with ritonavir (100 mg) twice daily. We obtained clinical data for chronic medical illnesses, physical examinations, laboratory and radiological results, and clinical progression and outcome from inpatient medical records.
 We reported the median (IQR) incubation period, defined as the duration between estimated dates of infection and reported symptom onset, using R. We reported the serial interval range between transmission pairs in the household cluster. We also calculated the probable number of transmissions arising from each confirmed case of COVID-19 by assuming that there was one unknown primary case for each of the three clusters.
 This study received no funding. The corresponding authors had full access to all data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
 Evidence before this study We searched PubMed up to Feb 15, 2020 for reports published in English with no date limitations using the keywords ""COVID-19"" and ""cluster"". A family cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Shenzhen, Guangdong. Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has also been reported among co-workers in Germany.
 We analysed three clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission. Our findings show that SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings beyond household clusters. Importation and limited local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred before the lockdown of Wuhan and China's institution of travel restrictions.
 Countries should focus on enhancing detection and containment of local clusters of COVID-19, through surveillance of individuals with general pneumonia or influenza-like illnesses, and of people who have been in contact with unwell travellers from China. It is also important for countries to do active case-finding among close contacts of affected individuals, including contacts with mild symptoms, to contain clusters and stop them from spreading.

 36 individuals were confirmed to have COVID-19, and these people were related to three local clusters, referred to as A (containing 11 people), B (consisting of 20 individuals), and C (comprising five people; figure 1 ). Of these affected individuals, 17 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore, of whom only two (both from cluster C) had recent travel history to China 14 days before onset of symptoms (table). Two people from cluster A and 17 from cluster B were reported by the health authorities of countries where they resided or travelled to.
 The Ministry of Health in Singapore was alerted to two individuals with locally acquired COVID-19 on Feb 3, 2020 (AC1 and AC2; figure 1 upper panels). They did not fit the case-definition for suspected COVID-19 but were tested because they reported frequent occupational contact with Chinese tourists. These two people were later identified to be linked epidemiologically to two other affected individuals (AGX1 and AGX2), a father and daughter reported by official and media websites in Guangxi, China, [8] [9] [10] to be Chinese tourists who travelled to Singapore on Jan 22, 2020, and who visited several tourist sites on Jan 22-23, 2020, as part of a tour group. AGX1 and AGX2 subsequently departed for Malaysia before re-entry into Singapore for their flight to Guangxi on Jan 27, 2020, and they developed symptoms on Jan 28, 2020, after arrival in Guangxi. Details of the tour participants and the itinerary, obtained through the Singapore-based tour guide for the Singapore tour segment (AT1, who also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2) corroborated with details for AGX1 and AGX2 reported by Guangxi websites.
 Of 20 tourists in the tour group from Guangxi, five or six were reported by AT1 to be coughing during the tour. To the best of our knowledge, only AGX1 and AGX2 had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2). 8 However, in view of the reported respi ratory symptoms among tour group participants, it is possible that other tour group members were the primary cases.
 Among the places visited by the tour group in Singapore were a complementary health products shop and a jewellery shop; both shops are patronised frequently by Chinese tour groups. The visits to the complementary health products shop lasted approximately 30 min, and the visit to the jewellery shop lasted roughly 1 h. Four assistants in the complementary health products shop (AC1, AC2, AC3, and AC4) and one assistant in the jewellery shop (AJ1) were identified to have COVID-19. All five shop assistants were at work on the day the tour group from Guangxi visited. AC1, AC2, AC3, and AC4 reported that they would assist customers to apply samples of medicinal oil on their bodies, and handwashing was not usually done between customers. Three secondary transmission cases were identified in the household of AC1 (AH1, AH2, and AH3), none of whom were contacts of other cases.
 For the cases who were confirmed on or before Feb 5, 2020, 179 close contacts who were in Singapore and contactable were placed under quarantine, of whom two close contacts (AC3 and AC4) subsequently reported to be unwell and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. An addi tional six close contacts were quarantined. For active surveillance, 16 shop assistants at the comple mentary health products shop and the sole remaining uninfected household member of AC1, who were all asymptomatic, were tested and none were positive for SARS-CoV-2.
 Age ( Viral genomic sequences were available for four cases (AH1, AH2, AH3, and AT1) and phylogenetic analysis confirmed their linkage, as suggested by the epidemiological data (appendix pp 2-3).
 On Feb 4, 2020, Malaysia confirmed a case of COVID-19 in an individual (B1) who had recent travel history to Singapore on Jan 16-23, 2020, for a company conference (a closed business meeting for employees from company branches globally), which was attended by at least 111 participants from 19 different countries on Jan 20-22, 2020. 17 attendees at the conference were from mainland China and at least one was from Wuhan. Subsequently, six participants at the conference who had no recent travel history to China (B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, and B7) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (figure 1 middle panels). Two affected individuals from Singapore were identified through contact tracing of participants after notification from the Malaysian International Health Regulation (IHR) focal point.
 The conference programme included business presentations, workshops, breakout discussions, a welcome reception and meals, team-building games, and a Singapore city bus tour. Seating arrangements (where available) for the conference, and interviews with affected individuals, indicated close interactions between cases. Two groups (B1 and B3, and B4 and B7) were seated at the same tables for a 3-h Chinese banquet-style dinner on Jan 20, 2020, with three and two attendees from China, respectively. Four cases (B1, B3, B4, and B5) were in a 4-h breakout session on Jan 21, 2020, with 41 other participants, including ten from China, of whom three had dined with B1 and B3 or B4 and B7 at the Chinese banquet. Furthermore, the team-building games entailed close physical contact.
 With initial news of B1, 15 conference participants remaining in Singapore were contacted to find out about their health status. Four people reported being unwell with fever, respiratory symptoms, or both and were tested for SARS-CoV-2; two individuals (B4 and B5) tested positive for the virus. The third local case (B6) was identified via activity mapping to have attended the conference and had subsequent interactions with company staff. 153 close contacts were placed under quarantine. Hotel staff were told to monitor their health status, and none reported being unwell during the conference or subsequently. 13 secondary cases of COVID-19 were reported among family members of B1 in Malaysia and contacts of B7 in France.
 The Ministry of Health in Singapore identified two people from Singapore (C3 and C4), with no recent travel history to China, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from enhanced pneumonia surveillance. Activity mapping showed that both individuals had visited the same church on Jan 19, 2020. C5 was identified through active case-finding. Two other people with COVID-19 were subsequently linked to this cluster (C1 and C2, who are husband and wife). These individuals were Chinese nationals from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on Jan 19, 2020. Re-interviews with C1 and C2 found they had also visited the church on the same day. All five people were asymptomatic during the church visit ( figure 1 lower panels) .
 The church is an independent church that occasionally receives a few visitors from China at the Mandarin service conducted every Sunday. 11 Although C1 and C2 were not church members, they attended the 2-h morning service when they travelled to Singapore. They left immediately after the service and did not report having lunch at the church. Based on closed-circuit camera findings, C5 occupied the same seat as did cases C1 and C2 at the prayer meeting after the morning service, but they did not recall meeting each other.
 Among the 227 regular church members, 191 members were contacted, of whom 142 attended the church on Jan 19, 2020. Of these people, only two had travel history to Guangdong, China, 14 days before Jan 19, 2020; both reported being well. Six were unwell and referred for further management and none tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 93 close contacts were placed under quarantine.
 No additional cases linked to any of the three clusters were identified as of Feb 14, 2020.
 Although we were unable to identify the primary case or cases in each cluster with certainty, in cluster A, the cases in the two shops and the tour guide had inter-related interactions with the Guangxi tour group in which two cases were found. Exposures of the shop assistants were assumed to occur on Jan 23, 2020, and the tour guide on Jan 22, 2020, or Jan 23, 2020. In cluster C, the only overlap in activities was on Jan 19, 2020, when all five cases visited the church and exposures most likely occurred. For cluster B, we used information on reported activities to infer most likely infection times within the meeting. Excluding the household cluster, we had information on both estimated infection time and reported date of symptom onset for 19 people. The incubation periods are plotted in figure 2 . The median incubation period was 4 days (IQR 3-6). Without accounting for potential tertiary transmission within the household (infected by a case who was not the primary case), the serial interval for the three transmission pairs in the household cluster ranged between 3 days and 8 days.
 Assuming one unknown primary case seeded the outbreaks in each cluster, we noted that 31% of transmission pairs were associated with one individual (B7), and 32 observed cases had no onward transmission (figure 3).
 Of 17 locally confirmed cases, fever and cough were the two most common symptoms, reported in 15 (88%) and 14 (82%) individuals, respectively (table). One case, a 6-month old male infant, was asymptomatic until one spike of fever 2 days into hospital admission. Pulmonary opacities were reported on chest radiography at admission in eight (53%) individuals, and developed over the course of admission in four additional people. Lymphopenia (<1·1 × 10⁹ cells per L) was seen in six people and thrombocytopenia (<150 × 10⁹ cells per L) in four individuals over the course of admission. Median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4 days (IQR 3-9).
 The clinical course was uncomplicated for most individuals, with resolution of symptoms over the first few days. Hospital admission was prolonged because of persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from nasopharyngeal swab testing (median 6 days, range 3-9). One individual needed supplemental oxygen via nasal prongs and another two developed acute respiratory distress requiring intubation and intensive care. Four individuals received experimental treatment of lopinavir with ritonavir. No deaths were recorded in these three clusters as of March 7, 2020.
 We report three clusters showing local transmission of COVID-19 in Singapore. The three clusters involved a Chinese tour group, company conference, and a church and show the transmissibility of COVID-19 in commu nity settings beyond household clusters. A household cluster was previously reported in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. 12 These findings have implications for public-health measures and outbreak investigations that other countries might consider to detect and contain transmission.
 The first indication of human-to-human transmission in Singapore was detected 11 days after confirmation of the first imported case. China imposed a lockdown of Wuhan on Jan 23, 2020, and suspended all outgoing tour groups beginning Jan 27, 2020. Despite these measures, local clusters were subsequently identified in Singapore, with probable links to travellers from China before the measures to curb travel were implemented. Although the primary case or cases in all three clusters cannot be conclusively identified, they are postulated to be tourists or business visitors from China. The tour group implicated in cluster A originated from Guangxi at a time when relatively few cases had been reported in that region of China. 13 Temperature screening for inbound travellers on flights from Wuhan was implemented in Singapore on Jan 3, 2020, and expanded to all flights from China on Jan 22, 2020. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that these primary cases could be identified by temperature screening, because there was no indication that they were febrile on arrival.
 Therefore, it is important that countries, particularly those with a high travel volume from China, enhance their surveillance system to identify local cases, not merely among people with a travel history to China because cases could be present in the community. The local cases in cluster C were identified through enhanced pneumonia surveillance of people who had no history of travel to China, whereas the initial cases in cluster A were identified because of heightened suspicion by health-care workers, leading to testing. Among the first 84 confirmed cases in Singapore, ten were detected by enhanced pneumonia surveillance and testing of patients in intensive care units, and another eight affected individuals were detected based on doctors' discretion to test patients whom they viewed with suspicion for clinical or epidemiological reasons. Such surveillance systems are, therefore, important to identify cases in the commu nity who would be missed if the focus were only on travellers, and they have enabled prompt investigation and containment measures. Furthermore, with swift response in contact tracing and quarantine of close contacts, two close contacts developed symptoms and were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 during their period of quarantine, ensuring no further onward transmission of the virus. Only two of 425 close contacts identified by contact tracing developed COVID-19 (ie, most cases identified in the clusters did not transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus to their close contacts), raising the hypothesis that a few spreading events can result in clusters of transmission, whereas for most cases, transmission ended. The ease of international travel makes containment difficult. Cluster B was identified because of sharing of case data in Malaysia through the IHR focal point, and Singapore shared information on attendees at the company conference to respective IHR focal points where participants at the conference had originated. This work led to early identification of cases globally and highlights the importance of international cooperation and sharing of information under IHR to aid in active case-finding and containment.
 The cases of COVID-19 in these three clusters are probably attributable to close or prolonged interactions. Direct physical contact was reported between shop assistants and tourists at the health products shop (cluster A). Handshaking and physical contact during team-building activities and sharing of meals were reported among participants of the business meeting (cluster B). 14 Therefore, direct transmission could be possible by contact or indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food). We have shown environmental contamination of commontouch surfaces in the isolation room of a confirmed case. 15 This find ing highlights the importance of emphasising personal and hand hygiene as a key public-health message that countries should adopt.
 Recall bias could affect the accuracy of symptom-onset dates reported by cases. In cluster A, the date of onset of symptoms for AC2 was uncertain because the individual only sought primary-care treatment on Jan 30, 2020, 7 days after reported onset of symptoms. Other exposures are plausible. AC2 reported having symptoms on the day of the tour group's arrival, and we could postulate that AC2 acquired infection from other tourists before Jan 23, 2020, and seeded infections among colleagues, the tour guide, and the two people from Guangxi on Jan 23, 2020. However, case AJ1 had no interactions with AC2, unless AC2 acquired infection serendipitously at a similar time, independently. Similarly, in cluster C, C1 did not report symptoms until 5 days and C2 until 3 days, after attending church, and this difference could be attri butable to recall bias of symptom-onset dates, particularly if symptoms were mild.
 Other study limitations include the small sample size used to ascertain the incubation period, because primary cases could not be identified with certainty. Moreover, symptom-onset dates and the movement of and exposure history of cases detected overseas were either based on media reports or were unknown. Based on symptomonset dates of 17 local cases, the median incubation period (4 days) corroborates other published findings. 16, 17 Although there is interest on asymptomatic transmission, we are unable to address this point in our study, and further studies should be done to better understand disease transmissibility of asymptomatic cases.
 In conclusion, as importation and local transmission could have occurred in other countries before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions by China, local clusters outside China can be expected and efforts should be focused on surveillance for locally acquired cases and containment efforts to prevent widespread community transmission.

Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.
 , sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1·0 × 10⁹ cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9-10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.
 Interpretation The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.","The type of pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease, and the ongoing outbreak has been declared by WHO as a global public health emergency. 1,2 COVID-19 pneumonia was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December, 2019, followed by an outbreak across Hubei Province and other parts of the country. 1 
 The Lancet by Huang and colleagues 2 reported the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as treatment and clinical out comes, of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. However, Huang and colleagues' report mainly focused on non-pregnant adults. The clinical characteristics and vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women is unknown. Urgent questions that need to be addressed promptly include whether pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia will develop distinct symptoms from non-pregnant adults, whether pregnant women who have confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia are more likely to die of the infection or to undergo preterm labour, and whether COVID-19 could spread vertically and pose risks to the fetus and neonate. Answers to these questions are essential for formulating the principles of obstetric treatment for pregnant women with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, to facilitate efforts, both in China and glo bally, to prevent and control COVID-19 pneumonia in children and pregnant women, 3 we retrospectively collected and analysed detailed clinical data from pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. In this study we present clinical features of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and examine the vertical trans mission potential of COVID-19. 
 We did a retrospective review of medical records from nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (4th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China. 4 All nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract.
 This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (approval number 2020004). Written informed consent was obtained from each enrolled patient.
 We reviewed clinical records, laboratory findings, and chest CT scans for all nine pregnant women. All information was obtained and curated with a customised data collection form. Two study investigators (JG and XY) independently reviewed the data collection forms to verify data accuracy.
 Maternal throat swab samples were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Kit (BioGerm, Shanghai, China), following WHO guidelines for qRT-PCR. 5 Amniotic fluid samples from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were obtained via direct syringe aspiration at the time of delivery. Cord blood and neonatal throat swab samples were collected immediately after delivery in the operating room. Additionally, breast milk samples from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were collected after their first lactation. Evidence of vertical transmission was evaluated by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in these clinical samples. Sample collection was successful in six cases (patients 2, 4-6, 8, and 9). Among the three patients from whom sample collection was not suc cessful, patient 1 was diagnosed after caesarean section, thus no sample was obtained. Patients 3 and 7 underwent caesarean section at night, thus immediate sample collection was not possible. All samples were processed at the State Key Laboratory of Virology/Institute of Medical Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, for further testing. Sample collection, pro cessing, and laboratory testing complied with WHO guidance. 6 All samples, as described above, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by use of qRT-PCR with the CDC recommended Kit. The test results were confirmed by nested RT-PCR with designed primers. For the nested RT-PCR assay, total RNA was extracted from samples by use of the TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by reverse transcription by use of the one-step RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Primers were designed on the basis of

 We retrospectively reviewed clinical records, laboratory findings, and chest CT scans for nine pregnant women with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in amniotic fluid, cord blood, breastmilk, and neonatal throat swab samples from six of nine patients. All nine women were in the third trimester. Seven presented with fever without chill. Other symptoms included cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two). Fetal distress occurred in two cases. Five of the nine patients had lymphopenia (<1·0 × 10⁹ cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. Nine livebirths were recorded. No severe neonatal asphyxia was observed. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-10 and 5-min Apgar score of 9-10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six of the nine patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all results were negative.
 The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Based on data from this small group of patients, there is currently no evidence of vertical transmission in pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in the third trimester.

 The nine pregnant women were all in their third trimester, and all underwent caesarean section. All patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19. The age range of the patients was 26-40 years, and the range of gestational weeks at admission was 36 weeks to 39 weeks plus 4 days. None of the patients had underlying diseases such as diabetes, chronic hypertension, or cardiovascular disease. One patient, Seven of the nine patients presented with a fever without chills, but none had a high fever (body temperature >39°C). Patients' body temperatures fluctuated within a range of 36·5-38·8°C. The two patients with a normal body temperature before caesarean section both had postpartum fever (range 37·8-39·3°C). Other symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection were also observed: four patients had a cough, three had myalgia, two reported a sore throat, and two indicated malaise. Additionally, one patient showed obvious gastrointestinal symptoms. Another patient had shortness of breath and preeclampsia. However, none of the nine patients developed severe pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation, or died of COVID-19 pneumonia, as of Feb 4, 2020. Pregnancy complications that appeared after the onset of COVID-19 infection included fetal distress (in two of nine patients) and premature rupture of the membrane (in two of nine; table 1).
 All patients were given oxygen support (nasal cannula) and empirical antibiotic treatment. Six patients were administered antiviral therapy (table 1) .
 Data from laboratory tests showed that five of the nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia had lymphopenia (<1·0 × 10⁹ cells per L). Six patients had ele vated concentrations of C-reactive protein (>10 mg/L). Three had increased concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), one of whom had ALT reaching 2093 U/L and AST reaching 1263 U/L. Additionally, seven patients had a normal white cell count, with none of the patients having a white cell count below the normal range (table 1).
 All nine patients had a chest CT scan. Eight patients showed typical findings of chest CT images-multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in lungs 2 (figure).
 Nine livebirths were recorded. No fetal death, neonatal death, or neonatal asphyxia was observed. Four patients had preterm labour, but all beyond 36 gestational weeks. Two of the four premature neonates at 36 gestational weeks plus 2 days had a birthweight lower than 2500 g (table 2). Neonate 4 had a birthweight of 1880 g and the pregnancy was complicated by pre-eclampsia. Neonate 7 had a birthweight of 2460 g. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9-10 (table 2). Neonate 1 had a mild increase in myocardial enzymes on the day of birth (myoglobin 170·8 ng/mL and creatine kinase-myocardial band 8·5 ng/mL), but without any clinical symptoms.
 The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was tested in amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples collected from six patients. Neither the Kit recommended by CDC nor our in-house nested RT-PCR assays detected SARS-CoV-2 in these samples.
 We report clinical data from nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 infection during pregnancy were similar to those of non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 infection, as previously reported. 2 None of the nine patients developed severe pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Notably, based on our findings in these nine patients, there is currently no evidence to s uggest that development of COVID-19 pneumonia in the third trimester of pregnancy could lead to the occurrence of severe Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia, because they are at an immunosuppressive state, and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy (eg, diaphragm elevation, increased oxygen consumption, and oedema of respiratory tract mucosa) can render them intolerant to hypoxia. For example, the 1918 influenza pandemic caused a mortality rate of 2·6% in the overall population, but 37% among pregnant women. 8 Pregnant women were reported to be at an increased risk of complications from the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection, and were more than four times more likely to be admitted to hospital than the general population (relative risk 4·3 [95% CI 2·3-7·8]). 9 Wong and colleagues 10 also reported that around 50% of pregnant women who developed SARS were admitted to the intensive care unit, around 33% of pregnant women with SARS required mechanical ventilation, and the mortality rate was as high as 25% for these women. In the current study, we treated nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in 11 days from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Considering that SARS-CoV-2 has up to 85% sequence similarity with SARS, [11] [12] [13] [14] although none of our patients developed severe pneumonia or died of COVID-19 infection, we should be alert to the possibility that the disease course and prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia could follow the same trend as SARS in pregnant women. However, our obser vations are based on a small number of cases and the time between illness onset and delivery was short.
 According to our study, pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a similar pattern of clinical characteristics to non-pregnant adult patients, as recently reported. 2, 15 Common symptoms at the onset of COVID-19 pneumonia for these women included a fever and cough, whereas less common symptoms were myalgia, malaise, sore throat, diarrhoea, and shortness of breath. Laboratory tests indicated that lymphopenia is also likely to occur. Additionally, increased concentrations However, none of these symptoms was present in every patient, nor were the symptoms specific to pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. By contrast, chest CT might have a high diagnostic value because of its typical images of virus infection, high accuracy with a low false negative rate, and time efficiency. Therefore, we recommend that, in addition to using nucleic acid tests as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, relevant clinical examinations are done, including blood counts and chest CT and a comprehensive evaluation of a patient's medical history, epidemiological exposure, and symptoms. All nine pregnant women in this study underwent a caesarean section. Indications for a caesarean section included severe pre-eclampsia, a history of caesarean sections, and fetal distress. Importantly, uncertainty about the risk of intrapartum mother-to-child transmission by vaginal delivery was another reason for carrying out caesarean sections. Four of the nine patients had preterm labour. However, the causes of premature birth were not related to COVID-19 pneumonia: one patient had severe pre-eclampsia, one had a history of two stillbirths, one had a history of two caesarean sections and irregular contractions; and one had premature rupture of the membrane for about 12 h and suspected intrauterine infection. Moreover, one neonate in our study had a birthweight of 1880 g at 36 gestational weeks plus 2 days, and this case was complicated by preeclampsia. Furthermore, the time period from onset of COVID-19 pneumonia to admission was only 3 days for this patient; therefore we reasoned that the fetal intrauterine growth restriction was more likely to be a symptom associated with pre-eclampsia. Importantly, all nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and 5-min Apgar score of 9-10. One infant had a mild increase in myocardial enzymes on the day of birth, but without any clinical symptoms. None of the neonates needed special paediatric treatment.
 The main focus of this study was to investigate the possibility of intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 infection. We chose to test amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples at birth to ascertain the possibility of intrauterine fetal infection. Notably, all the samples tested in our study were collected in the operating room at the time of the caesarean section, thus guaranteeing that the samples were not contaminated and best represented fetal intrauterine conditions. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 was negative in all of the above samples, suggesting that no intrauterine fetal infections occurred as a result of COVID-19 infection during a late stage of pregnancy. Our findings are in accordance with what was observed in SARS, which has a similar sequence to SARS-CoV-2. 14 Previous studies have already shown no evidence of perinatal SARS infection among infants born to mothers who developed SARS infection during pregnancy. 10, 16 However, our observation of no fetal infection caused by intrauterine vertical transmission could be affected by our small sample size and the stage of pregnancy at the onset of COVID-19 infection. All patients in the study were recruited in their third trimester, so we were unable to ascertain the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission during the first or second trimester. For example, rubella infection in the first trimester can affect more than 50% of fetuses via intrauterine infection, whereas by the end of the second trimester the incidence rate is reduced by half. 17 We did not collect samples of vaginal mucosa or shedding in birth canals, which prevented us from analysing whether COVID-19 could be transmitted during vaginal delivery. Notably, however, our results showed that breastmilk samples from mothers with COVID-19 infection appeared to be free from SARS-CoV-2.
 On Feb 6, 2020, a neonate born to a pregnant woman with COVID-19 pneumonia tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection 36 h after birth. 18, 19 Although many important clinical details of this single case were not available at the time of writing this report, there are reasonable concerns that COVID-19 could be contracted in the womb. Reportedly, the pregnant woman had developed fever for 8 h and was suspected to have COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of her typical chest CT image before admission; an emergency caesarean section was subsequently done, which was followed by confirmation of COVID-19 pneumonia. Moreover, the neonate's throat swab sample was collected approximately 30 h after birth, thus providing no direct evidence for intrauterine infection. Additionally, no direct testing of intrauterine tissue samples such as amniotic fluid, cord blood, or placenta was done to confirm that the COVID-19 infection in the neonate was due to intrauterine transmission. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether or not intrauterine COVID-19 infection occurred in this particular case. Nonetheless, this single case of an infected neonate suggests that we should pay special attention to prevent infections in newborn babies born to mothers with COVID-19 pneumonia.
 This study is limited by the small sample size and retrospective method. Several considerations should be taken into account when interpreting the findings. First, all enrolled patients were in the third trimester. The effect of COVID-19 infection on the fetus in the first or second trimester of pregnancy remains to be clarified. Second, whether vaginal delivery increases the risk of mother-to-child intrapartum transmission, and whether uterine contraction could increase the possibility of the virus ascending, needs to be further investigated. Third, the risk of infection in pregnant women and the effects of the time or mode of delivery on pregnancy outcomes were not evaluated. Fourth, whether COVID-19 could damage the placenta, which represents an important link in vertical transmission, also needs to be further investigated. Future investigations of these issues and follow-up studies of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, as well as neonates, will be necessary to ascertain the safety and health of mothers and babies exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
 In summary, the symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were diverse, with the main symptoms being fever and cough. We found no evidence for vertical transmission in late pregnancy. Considering the significance of this ongoing global public health emergency, although our conclusions are limited by the small sample size, we believe that the findings reported here are important for understanding the clinical characteristics and vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women.

Since the launch of The Lancet Series in 2014, various public health threats have continued to pose public health challenges for the planning of events and during events at various mass gathering events. 19 The Kumbh Mela is a highly coordinated and organised event, where WHO recomendations for mass gatherings are implemented (panel 3). 20] [21] [22] A range of healthcare facilities are put in place and hospitals are prepared to receive pilgrims requiring inpatient treatment and intensive care for every Kumbh Mela festival. 22 State government irrigation and water resources departments and the Central Pollution Control Board work closely together to increase the capacity of sewage treatment plants and to ensure sufficient flow to remove contamination by releasing water into rivers. 19 Approximately 45 000 toilets were provided, although there was little health promotion messaging. 17, 18 Contamination of river water with faeces, urine, saliva, and sputa is inevitable and leads to transmission of waterborne and respiratory tract infections. 12, 14, 20, 21 A notable example of such a cycle of transmission is the 1817-24 Asia cholera pandemic, which was associated with the Kumbh Mela. These island communities (some very small, such as the Pitcairn Islands with fewer than 50 residents) would have been greatly affected by the introduction of a novel disease. These two aspects were essential in host countries' ability to implement comprehensive and intensive massgathering surveillance. In doing so, these events proved the value of the mass gathering surveillance in providing health security assurance to event organisers, participants, and local and regional communities as well as showing that small island nations can meet International Health Regulations requirements and implement enhanced massgathering surveillance. Various public health concerns were raised before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics and Paralympics in August, 2016. [ 50 There was global pressure for the Games to be either postponed or moved to another country. GeoSentinel is a global network of travel medicine providers focused on sentinel surveillance, which generates evidencebased assessments of infectious disease risks for attendees of future mass gatherings events. 50 gathering events during infectious disease outbreaks with epidemic potential. The 23rd World Scout Jamboree was hosted by Japan between July 28 and Aug 8, 2015, and was attended by 33 000 scouts of up to 17 years of age from 162 countries. It takes place every 4 years, with the site of the Jamboree rotating between continents. However, within 9 days of the end of the event, six cases of laboratoryconfirmed invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitides capsular serogroup W occurred among scouts and their close contacts in Scotland and Sweden. [ 65] [66] [67] Soon after return to Scotland, three scouts and one relative were diagnosed with invasive meningo coccal disease. These cases were all associated with one scout unit. Two confirmed cases of invasive meningo coccal disease were reported from Sweden. No other cases were reported from scouts who attended from other European countries or Japan. 67 Further car riage studies are required during mass gatherings to determine the epidemiology and association between carrier isolates and diseasecausing isolates in the population and the dynamics of globali sation from mass gathering events. Every year an increasing number of people travel to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. 10 All these data are fed directly to a central command and control unit, enabling rapid amalgamation and analyses of data and necessary public health interventions. Because of the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa (2013-16), 69 74 concerns were expressed by the global public health fraternity regarding pilgrims from affected countries travelling to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj or Umrah. 70 The Saudi government implemented restrictions only to countries affected by the Ebola outbreak. Secondarycare referral hospitals catered for critical care, internal medicine, general surgery, ortho paedics, gynaecology, paediatrics, psychiatry, dermatology, isolation, lab medicine, and radiology. Urinary tract infections were common in female pilgrims. Ebola, MERSCoV, Alkhumra viral haemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever have high outbreak potential during Hajj. 79 Other corona viruses identified at the Hajj include alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, of which the 229E strain is most common cause of upper respiratory tract illnesses. 10, 68 Recom mended vaccines include influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine. 85] [86] [87] However, concern that new serogroups of N meningitidis (eg, B and X), which are not covered in the current quadrivalent vaccine targeting serogroups A, C, W135, and Y, could be a cause of future epidemics is increasing. 88, 89 Owing to the high incidence of pertussis seen among Hajj pilgrims in 2003, 90 Bordetella pertussis is considered a risk in pilgrims, especially those who have not completed their immuni sation schedule. Further studies are required to define the scale of the tuberculosis during the Hajj and to develop proactive screening, treatment, and prevention guidelines. 33, 34, 93 To prevent emergence of and spread of antibioticresistant bacteria, antibiotic pre scription and consumption by pilgrims at mass gathering events should be rationalised and regulated. 68 Risk factors associated with high morbidity were old age and preexisting comorbidities. 95
 In contrast to mass gathering religious events, sport and music concerts 96 attract younger individuals of 15-25 years of age. Additionally, loud noise at music festivals can lead to deafness, hence legislation is needed to keep to certain noise thresholds. Several mass casualty incidents have occurred between 2015 and 2018 (table; appendix). This incident resulted in crush injuries and suffocation, with 769 pilgrim deaths and 934 injured. Preparations for mass casualty incidents are mandated by the WHO and followed by the organising authorities. When these incidences occur, local investi gations and reviews are done to assess the underlying factors leading to the mass casualty incident, assess the effectiveness of the response, and identify lessons for inclusion in future mass gathering planning. A 30year literature review 100 of 290 mass casualty events at mass gatherings showed that the most frequent mechanism of injury involved the movement of people under crowded conditions (162 [56%] of 290). A need also remains for high quality studies that are appropriately designed and adequately powered using participants from several geographical regions to provide data that stand up to rigorous scientific review.

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.
 All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.

Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα.
 Interpretation The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.","Coronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positivesense RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales and broadly distributed in humans and other mammals. 1 Although most human coronavirus infections are mild, the epidemics of the two betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] [3] [4] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 5, 6 have caused more than 10 000 cumulative cases in the past two decades, with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV. 7, 8 The coronaviruses already identified might only be the tip of the iceberg, with potentially more novel and severe zoonotic events to be revealed.
 In December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with clinical presentations greatly resembling viral pneumonia. 9 Deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Thus far, more than 800 confirmed cases, including in health-care workers, have been identified in Wuhan, and several exported cases have been confirmed in other provinces in China, and in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the USA. 10- 13 We aim to describe epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection, and to compare the clinical features between intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients. We hope our study findings will inform the global community of the emergence of this novel coronavirus and its clinical features.
 Following the pneumonia cases of unknown cause reported in Wuhan and considering the shared history of exposure to Huanan seafood market across the patients, an epidemiological alert was released by the local health authority on Dec 31, 2019, and the market was shut down on Jan 1, 2020. Meanwhile, 59 suspected cases with fever and dry cough were transferred to a designated hospital starting from Dec 31, 2019. An expert team of physicians, epidemiologists, virologists, and government officials was soon formed after the alert.
 Since the cause was unknown at the onset of these emerging infections, the diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan was based on clinical characteristics, chest imaging, and the ruling out of common bacterial and viral pathogens that cause pneumonia. Suspected patients were isolated using airborne precautions in the designated hospital, Jin Yintan Hospital (Wuhan, China), and fit-tested N95 masks and airborne precautions for aerosol-generating procedures were taken. This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of Jin Yin-tan Hospital (KY-2020-01.01). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases.
 Local centres for disease control and prevention collected respiratory, blood, and faeces specimens, then shipped them to designated authoritative laboratories to detect the pathogen (NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Mérieux Laboratory, Beijing, China). A novel coronavirus, which was named 2019-nCoV, was isolated then from lower respiratory tract specimen and a diagnostic test for this virus was developed soon after that. 14 Of 59 suspected cases, 41 patients were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV. The presence of 2019-nCoV in respi ratory specimens was detected by nextgeneration se quencing or real-time RT-PCR methods. The primers and probe target to envelope gene of CoV were used and the sequences were as follows: forward primer 5′-ACTTCTTTTTCTTGCTTTCGTGGT-3′; reverse primer 5′-GCAGCAGTACGCACACAATC-3′; and the probe 5′CY5-CTAGTTACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGC-3′BHQ1. Conditions for the amplifications were 50°C for 15 min, 95°C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 30 s. Initial investigations included a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum biochemical test (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes). Respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, or bronchial aspirates were tested for common viruses, including influenza, avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using real-time RT-PCR assays approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. Routine bacterial and fungal examinations were also performed.
 Given the emergence of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases during the influenza season, antibiotics (orally and intravenously) and osel tamivir (orally 75 mg twice daily) were empirically administered. Corticosteroid therapy
 Evidence before this study Human coronaviruses, including hCoV-229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, cause mild respiratory diseases. Fatal coronavirus infections that have emerged in the past two decades are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We searched PubMed and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database for articles published up to Jan 11, 2020, using the keywords ""novel coronovirus"", ""2019 novel coronavirus"", or ""2019-nCoV"". No published work about the human infection caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) could be identified.
 We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 41 laboratory-confirmed cases infected with 2019-nCoV.
 27 (66%) of 41 patients had a history of direct exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The median age of patients was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0), and 13 (32%) patients had underlying disease. All patients had pneumonia. A third of patients were admitted to intensive care units, and six died. High concentrations of cytokines were recorded in plasma of critically ill patients infected with 2019-nCoV.
 Implications of all the available evidence 2019-nCoV caused clusters of fatal pneumonia with clinical presentation greatly resembling SARS-CoV. Patients infected with 2019-nCoV might develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, have a high likelihood of admission to intensive care, and might die. The cytokine storm could be associated with disease severity. More efforts should be made to know the whole spectrum and pathophysiology of the new disease.
 (methylprednisolone 40-120 mg per day) was given as a combined regimen if severe community-acquired pneumonia was diagnosed by physicians at the designated hospital. Oxygen support (eg, nasal cannula and invasive mechanical ventilation) was administered to patients according to the severity of hypoxaemia. Repeated tests for 2019-nCoV were done in patients confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection to show viral clearance before hospital discharge or discontinuation of isolation.
 We reviewed clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays for all patients with laboratoryconfirmed 2019-nCoV infection who were reported by the local health authority. The admission data of these patients was from Dec 16, 2019, to Jan 2, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with standardised data collection forms (modified case record form for severe acute respiratory infection clinical characterisation shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) from electronic medical records. Two researchers also independently reviewed the data collection forms to double check the data collected. To ascertain the epidemiological and symptom data, which were not available from electronic medical records, the researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.
 To characterise the effect of coronavirus on the production of cytokines or chemokines in the acute phase of the illness, plasma cytokines and chemokines (IL1B, IL1RA, IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL8 (also known as CXCL8), IL9, IL10, IL12p70, IL13, IL15, IL17A, Eotaxin (also known as CCL11), basic FGF2, GCSF (CSF3), GMCSF (CSF2), IFNγ, IP10 (CXCL10), MCP1 (CCL2), MIP1A (CCL3), MIP1B (CCL4), PDGFB, RANTES (CCL5), TNFα, and VEGFA were measured using Human Cytokine Standard 27-Plex Assays panel and the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for all patients according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasma samples from four healthy adults were used as controls for crosscomparison. The median time from being transferred to a designated hospital to the blood sample collection was 4 days (IQR 2-5).
 Each 80 µL plasma sample from the patients and contacts was added into 240 µL of Trizol LS (10296028; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in the Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. Total RNA was extracted by Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (R2050; Zymo research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and 50 µL elution was obtained for each sample. 5 µL RNA was used for real-time RT-PCR, which targeted the NP gene using AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagent (AM1005; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The final reaction mix concentration of the primers was 500 nM and probe was 200 nM. Real-time RT-PCR was per formed using the following conditions: 50°C for 15 min and 95°C for 3 min, 50 cycles of amplification at 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 45 s. Since we did not perform tests for detecting infectious virus in blood, we avoided the term viraemia and used RNAaemia instead. RNAaemia was defined as a positive result for real-time RT-PCR in the plasma sample.
 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock were defined according to the interim guidance of WHO for novel coronavirus. 9 Hypoxaemia was defined as arterial oxygen tension (PaO₂) over inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO₂) of less than 300 mm Hg. 15 Acute kidney injury was identified and classified on the basis of the highest serum creatinine level or urine output criteria according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes classification. 16 Secondary infection was diagnosed if the patients had clinical symptoms or signs of nosocomial pneumonia or bacteraemia, and was combined with a positive culture of a new pathogen from a lower respiratory tract specimen (including the sputum, transtracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or from blood samples taken ≥48 h after admission). 17 Cardiac injury followed the definition used in our previous study in H7N9 patients. 18 In brief, cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography.
 Continuous variables were expressed as median (IQR) and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables were expressed as number (%) and compared by χ² test or Fisher's exact test between ICU care and no ICU care groups. Boxplots were drawn to describe plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations. A two-sided α of less than 0·05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using the SAS software, version 9.4, unless otherwise indicated.

 By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan. 20 [49%]) of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients were aged 25-49 years, and 14 (34%) were aged 50-64 years (figure 1A). The median age of the patients was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0; table 1). In our cohort of the first 41 patients as of Jan 2, no children or adolescents were infected. Of the 41 patients, 13 (32%) were admitted to the ICU because they required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support measures to cor rect hypoxaemia. Most of the infected patients were men ( ). The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. None of his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms. No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases. The first fatal case, who had continuous exposure to the market, was admitted to hospital because of a 7-day history of fever, cough, and dyspnoea. 5 days after illness onset, his wife, a 53-year-old woman who had no known history of exposure to the market, also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalised in the isolation ward.
 The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever ( Most patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission (procalcitonin <0·1 ng/mL; 27 [69%] patients; table 2). Four ICU patients developed secondary infections. Three of the four patients with secondary infection had procalcitonin greater than 0·5 ng/mL (0·69 ng/mL, 1·46 ng/mL, and 6·48 ng/mL).
 On admission, abnormalities in chest CT images were detected among all patients. Of the 41 patients, 40 (98%) had bilateral involvement (table 2). The typical findings of chest CT images of ICU patients on admission were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation ( figure 3A) . The representative chest CT findings of non-ICU patients showed bilateral groundglass opacity and subseg mental areas of consolidation (figure 3B). Later chest CT images showed bilateral ground-glass opacity, whereas the consolidation had been resolved (figure 3C).
 Initial plasma IL1B, IL1RA, IL7, IL8, IL9, IL10, basic FGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFNγ, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, MIP1B, PDGF, TNFα, and VEGF concentrations were higher in both ICU patients and non-ICU patients than in healthy adults (appendix pp 6-7). Plasma levels of IL5, IL12p70, IL15, Eotaxin, and RANTES were similar between healthy adults and patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Further comparison between ICU and non-ICU patients showed that plasma concentrations of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα were higher in ICU patients than non-ICU patients.
 All patients had pneumonia. ; table 3 ). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in four (10%) patients, with two of them (5%) had refractory hypoxaemia and received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as salvage therapy. All patients were administered with empirical antibiotic treatment, and 38 (93%) patients received antiviral therapy (osel tamivir). Additionally, nine (22%) patients were given systematic corticosteroids. A comparison of clinical features between patients who received and did not receive systematic corticosteroids is in the appendix (pp 1-5).
 As of Jan 22, 2020, 28 (68%) of 41 patients have been dis charged and six (15%) patients have died. Fitness for discharge was based on abatement of fever for at least 10 days, with improvement of chest radiographic evidence and viral clearance in respiratory samples from upper respiratory tract.
 We report here a cohort of 41 patients with laboratoryconfirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Patients had serious, sometimes fatal, pneumonia and were admitted to the designated hospital in Wuhan, China, by Jan 2, 2020. Clinical presentations greatly resemble SARS-CoV. Patients with severe illness developed ARDS and required ICU admission and oxygen therapy. The time between hospital admission and ARDS was as short as 2 days. At this stage, the mortality rate is high for 2019-nCoV, because six (15%) of 41 patients in this cohort died.
 The number of deaths is rising quickly. As of Jan 24, 2020, 835 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infec tions were reported in China, with 25 fatal cases. Reports have been released of exported cases in many provinces in China, and in other countries; See Online for appendix some health-care workers have also been infected in Wuhan. Taken together, evidence so far indicates human transmission for 2019-nCoV. We are concerned that 2019-nCoV could have acquired the ability for efficient human trans mission. 19 Airborne precautions, such as a fit-tested N95 respirator, and other personal protective equipment are strongly recommended. To prevent further spread of the disease in health-care settings that are caring for patients infected with 2019-nCoV, onset of fever and respiratory symptoms should be closely moni tored among health-care workers. Testing of respiratory specimens should be done immediately once a diagnosis is suspected. Serum antibodies should be tested among health-care workers before and after their exposure to 2019-nCoV for identification of asymp tomatic infections. Similarities of clinical features between 2019-nCoV and previous betacoronavirus infections have been noted. In this cohort, most patients presented with fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT scans. These features of 2019-nCoV infection bear some resemblance to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. 20, 21 However, few patients with 2019-nCoV infection had prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms (eg, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, or sore throat), indicating that the target cells might be located in the lower airway. Furthermore, 2019-nCoV patients rarely developed intestinal signs and symptoms (eg, diarrhoea), whereas about 20-25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection had diarrhoea. 21 Faecal and urine samples should be tested to exclude a potential alternative route of transmission that is unknown at this stage.
 The pathophysiology of unusually high pathogenicity for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has not been completely understood. Early studies have shown that increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in serum (eg, IL1B, IL6, IL12, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1) were associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS patients. 22 MERS-CoV infection was also reported to induce increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα, IL15, and IL17). 23 We noted that patients infected with 2019-nCoV also had high amounts of IL1B, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1, probably leading to activated T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses. Moreover, patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα than did those not requiring ICU admission, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity. However, 2019-nCoV infection also initiated increased secretion of T-helper-2 (Th2) cytokines (eg, IL4 and IL10) that suppress inflammation, which differs from SARS-CoV infection. 22 Further studies are necessary to characterise the Th1 and Th2 responses in 2019-nCoV infection and to elucidate the pathogenesis. Autopsy or biopsy studies would be the key to understand the disease.
 In view of the high amount of cytokines induced by SARS-CoV, 22, 24 MERS-CoV, 25, 26 and 2019-nCoV infections, corticosteroids were used frequently for treatment of patients with severe illness, for possible benefit by reducing inflammatory-induced lung injury. However, current evidence in patients with SARS and MERS suggests that receiving corticosteroids did not have an effect on mortality, but rather delayed viral clearance. [27] [28] [29] Therefore, corticosteroids should not be routinely given systemically, according to WHO interim guidance. 30 Among our cohort of 41 laboratory-confirmed patients with 2019-nCoV infection, corticosteroids were given to very few non-ICU cases, and low-to-moderate dose of corticosteroids were given to less than half of severely ill patients with ARDS. Further evidence is urgently needed to assess whether systematic corticosteroid treatment is beneficial or harmful for patients infected with 2019-nCoV.
 No antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective. In a historical control study, 31 the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir among SARS-CoV patients was associated with substantial clinical benefit (fewer adverse clinical outcomes). Arabi and colleagues initiated a placebo-controlled trial of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir, and ritonavir among patients with MERS infection in Saudi Arabia. 32 Preclinical evidence showed the potent efficacy of remdesivir (a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug) to treat MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. 33, 34 As 2019-nCoV is an emerging virus, an effective treatment has not been developed for disease resulting from this virus. Since the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was already available in the designated hospital, a randomised controlled trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalised with 2019-nCoV infection.
 Our study has some limitations. First, for most of the 41 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed with lower respiratory tract specimens and no paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained to investigate the difference in the viral RNA detection rate between upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Serological detection was not done to look for 2019-nCoV antibody rises in 18 patients with undetectable viral RNA. Second, with the limited number of cases, it is difficult to assess host risk factors for disease severity and mortality with multivariableadjusted methods. This is a modest-sized case series of patients admitted to hospital; collection of standardised data for a larger cohort would help to further define the clinical presentation, natural history, and risk factors. Further studies in outpatient, primary care, or community settings are needed to get a full picture of the spectrum of clinical severity. At the same time, finding of statistical tests and p values should be interpreted with caution, and non-significant p values do not necessarily rule out difference between ICU and non-ICU patients. Third, since the causative pathogen has just been identified, kinetics of viral load and antibody titres were not available. Finally, the potential exposure bias in our study might account for why no paediatric or adolescent patients were reported in this cohort. More effort should be made to answer these questions in future studies.
 Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were believed to originate in bats, and these infections were transmitted directly to humans from market civets and dromedary camels, respectively. 35 Extensive research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has driven the discovery of many SARS-like and MERS-like coronaviruses in bats. In 2013, Ge and colleagues 36 reported the whole genome sequence of a SARS-like coronavirus in bats with that ability to use human ACE2 as a receptor, thus having replication potentials in human cells. 37 2019-nCoV still needs to be studied deeply in case it becomes a global health threat. Reliable quick pathogen tests and feasible differential diagnosis based on clinical description are crucial for clinicians in their first contact with suspected patients. Because of the pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV, careful surveillance is essential to monitor its future host adaption, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity.

 36 individuals were confirmed to have COVID-19, and these people were related to three local clusters, referred to as A (containing 11 people), B (consisting of 20 individuals), and C (comprising five people; figure 1 ). Two people from cluster A and 17 from cluster B were reported by the health authorities of countries where they resided or travelled to. They did not fit the case-definition for suspected COVID-19 but were tested because they reported frequent occupational contact with Chinese tourists. AGX1 and AGX2 subsequently departed for Malaysia before re-entry into Singapore for their flight to Guangxi on Jan 27, 2020, and they developed symptoms on Jan 28, 2020, after arrival in Guangxi. Details of the tour participants and the itinerary, obtained through the Singapore-based tour guide for the Singapore tour segment (AT1, who also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2) corroborated with details for AGX1 and AGX2 reported by Guangxi websites. Among the places visited by the tour group in Singapore were a complementary health products shop and a jewellery shop; both shops are patronised frequently by Chinese tour groups. An addi tional six close contacts were quarantined. Age ( Viral genomic sequences were available for four cases (AH1, AH2, AH3, and AT1) and phylogenetic analysis confirmed their linkage, as suggested by the epidemiological data (appendix pp 2-3). Two groups (B1 and B3, and B4 and B7) were seated at the same tables for a 3-h Chinese banquet-style dinner on Jan 20, 2020, with three and two attendees from China, respectively. 153 close contacts were placed under quarantine. Hotel staff were told to monitor their health status, and none reported being unwell during the conference or subsequently. Re-interviews with C1 and C2 found they had also visited the church on the same day. 11 Although C1 and C2 were not church members, they attended the 2-h morning service when they travelled to Singapore. Among the 227 regular church members, 191 members were contacted, of whom 142 attended the church on Jan 19, 2020. Of these people, only two had travel history to Guangdong, China, 14 days before Jan 19, 2020; both reported being well. No additional cases linked to any of the three clusters were identified as of Feb 14, 2020. For cluster B, we used information on reported activities to infer most likely infection times within the meeting. The incubation periods are plotted in figure 2 . Of 17 locally confirmed cases, fever and cough were the two most common symptoms, reported in 15 (88%) and 14 (82%) individuals, respectively (table). Four individuals received experimental treatment of lopinavir with ritonavir. No deaths were recorded in these three clusters as of March 7, 2020. We report three clusters showing local transmission of COVID-19 in Singapore. 12 These findings have implications for public-health measures and outbreak investigations that other countries might consider to detect and contain transmission. China imposed a lockdown of Wuhan on Jan 23, 2020, and suspended all outgoing tour groups beginning Jan 27, 2020. Despite these measures, local clusters were subsequently identified in Singapore, with probable links to travellers from China before the measures to curb travel were implemented. Although the primary case or cases in all three clusters cannot be conclusively identified, they are postulated to be tourists or business visitors from China. 13 Temperature screening for inbound travellers on flights from Wuhan was implemented in Singapore on Jan 3, 2020, and expanded to all flights from China on Jan 22, 2020. The ease of international travel makes containment difficult. However, case AJ1 had no interactions with AC2, unless AC2 acquired infection serendipitously at a similar time, independently. Similarly, in cluster C, C1 did not report symptoms until 5 days and C2 until 3 days, after attending church, and this difference could be attri butable to recall bias of symptom-onset dates, particularly if symptoms were mild. Based on symptomonset dates of 17 local cases, the median incubation period (4 days) corroborates other published findings. 16, 17 Although there is interest on asymptomatic transmission, we are unable to address this point in our study, and further studies should be done to better understand disease transmissibility of asymptomatic cases."

No active or passive immunoprophylaxis for disease induced by SARS coronavirus is available. We investigated prophylaxis of SARS coronavirus infection with a neutralising human monoclonal antibody in ferrets, which can be readily infected with the virus. Prophylactic administration of the monoclonal antibody at 10 mg/kg reduced replication of SARS coronavirus in the lungs of infected ferrets by 3·3 logs (95% CI 2·6-4·0 logs; p<0·001), completely prevented the development of SARS coronavirus-induced macroscopic lung pathology (p=0·013), and abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions. The data generated in this animal model show that administration of a human monoclonal antibody might offer a feasible and effective prophylaxis for the control of human SARS coronavirus infection. 0 · 0 3 0 · 0 5 0 · 1 0 · 2 0 · 4 0 · 8 1 · 6 3 · 2 6 · 3 1 2 · 5 incubated for 1 h at 37°C with different concentrations of CR3014 or control antibody. The presence or absence of a cytopathic effect was scored in each well on day 5 after infection, and the percentage of protected wells was noted ( figure 1D ). We tested the in-vivo potency of this antibody in ferrets, because these animals can be readily infected with SARS coronavirus by the intratracheal route, replicate the virus to high titres in the lung, and develop macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions. 3 Experimental infection of ferrets with human respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, is common practice, therefore procedures to work with these animals under the biocontainment conditions required for SARS coronavirus are well established. Approval for animal experiments was obtained from the institutional animal welfare committee.
 In the first set of experiments, ferrets (Mustela furo, female, weight 800-900 g) were infected intratracheally with either 10 3 TCID 50 or 10 4 TCID 50 (n=8 for each group) of SARS coronavirus strain HKU-39849, which had been preincubated in 1 mL of cell-culture medium at 37°C for 1 h with either CR3014 or an human IgG1 control monoclonal antibody (n=4 for each group). The concentration of antibody in the medium was a 20-fold excess of the concentration theoretically needed for neutralisation of the challenge dose (0·13 mg/mL for the lower and 1·3 mg/mL for the higher challenge dose). Pharyngeal swabs were taken from the animals before challenge and on days 2, 4, and 7 after challenge, and frozen at -70°C before being subjected to quantitative RT-PCR. Two animals from each of the four groups were killed on days 4 and 7 and necropsies were done according to a standard protocol. For assessment of lung inflammation associated with SARS coronavirus infection, haematoxylineosin-stained sections from the cranial and caudal parts of the lung were examined for inflammatory foci by light microscopy with a 10ϫ objective. For measurement of the SARS coronavirus titre, homogenates were prepared from 0·1-0·3 g of lung tissue pooled from cranial, medial, and caudal parts of the lung.
 All control ferrets had high titres of SARS coronavirus in their lungs on day 4, and lower titres on day 7. Viral replication was accompanied by multifocal pulmonary lesions affecting about 5-10% of the surface area of the lung. Histologically lesions consisted mainly of mild alveolar damage as well as peribronchial and perivascular lymphocyte infiltration. RT-PCR on pharyngeal swabs showed that virus was shed in the throat throughout day 7. Animals exposed to the mixture of virus and CR3014 had almost undetectable titres of SARS coronavirus in the lung, showed no lung lesions on day 4 or 7, and did not shed SARS coronavirus in their throats.
 In the second set of experiments, two groups of ferrets (n=4 in each group) received an intraperitoneal injection of either CR3014 or the control antibody at a concentration of 10 mg/kg, 24 h before intratracheal infection with 10 4 TCID 50 SARS coronavirus, strain HKU-39849. Venous blood was drawn before administration of monoclonal antibody, before challenge, and on day 2 after the challenge. We measured the human IgG1 content of the serum by ELISA, and the neutralising capacity by a neutralisation assay using the fixed virus-varying serumdilution format. Pharyngeal swabs were taken from the animals before the inoculation and on days 2 and 4 after the challenge for quantitative RT-PCR. All animals were killed on day 4 and lung samples were taken as described for the first set of experiments.
 The mean SARS coronavirus titre in lung homogenates of the animals given CR3014 was 3·3 logs lower than that with the animal reservoir. 1 Two recent cases of laboratoryacquired SARS coronavirus infections in China spread into the community and triggered extensive efforts in tracing and isolating contacts of patients to prevent a new epidemic. Means to control SARS coronavirus infection through active or passive immunisation are, therefore, urgently needed.
 Passive transfer of mouse immune serum has been shown to reduce pulmonary viral titres in mice infected with SARS coronavirus. 2 Immunoprophylaxis of SARS coronavirus infection with human monoclonal antibodies might therefore be a viable strategy to control SARS.
 We generated a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody, CR3014, reactive with whole inactivated SARS coronavirus, by antibody phage display technology screening a large naive antibody library. Binding of this antibody to the viral peplomers was visualised by electron microscopy with indirect two-step immunogold labelling. SARS coronavirus from the supernatant of infected Vero cells was adsorbed to copper grids coated with carbon and Pioloform, which were incubated with the monoclonal antibodies by floating on droplets for 30 min at room temperature. Bound monoclonal antibodies were detected by incubation on droplets of anti-human-IgG-gold-5 nm conjugates (British Biocell, Cardiff, UK). The grids were negative contrasted with 1% uranyl acetate and assessed with a ZEISS EM 10 A transmission electron microscope ( figure 1A, 1B) . CR3014 was shown to react with the cell-surface expressed spike glycoprotein of SARS coronavirus: HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid-expressed, codon-optimised full-length glycoprotein spike, and stained with CR3014 and an R-phycoerythrin-labelled second antibody after 48 h using standard procedures for FACS-analysis ( figure  1C) . CR3014 was also shown to neutralise SARS coronavirus in vitro: triplicate wells of Vero cells were infected with 100 TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) of SARS coronavirus strain HK-39849, and pre- figure  2C ) and a reduction of microscopic lesions compared with controls, which all showed multifocal lesions on gross necropsy ( figure 2D ). Shedding of SARS coronavirus in the throat was completely abolished in three of the four animals treated with CR3014 ( figure 2B) . However, in one animal the level of SARS coronavirus excretion was similar to that noted in the control group. The concentration of CR3014 in the serum of this ferret before challenge was less than 5 g/mL, compared with 65-84 g/mL in the other three animals, suggesting inappropriate antibody administration. Neutralising serum titres in this animal were less than half of those in the other animals on day 0 (titre of 5 against 100 TCID 50 ), and were not detectable on day 2 after infection, compared with a titre of 5-10 against 100 TCID 50 in the other animals on day 2. SARS coronavirus has been detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates of up to 72% of SARS patients, being associated with increased mortality, and in the lungs of all autopsied patients by viral isolation or RT-PCR. 4 On the basis of our data and the successful prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus disease with a humanised monoclonal antibody (Palivizumab), we reason that immunoprophylaxis of SARS coronavirus infection with a human monoclonal antibody might be an option for the control of SARS. 5 The prophylactic dose we used for CR3014 (10 mg/kg) is less than the 15 mg/kg dose at which Palivizumab is given intramuscularly to at-risk infants once a month. If CR3014 reduced the replication of SARS coronavirus in people to the same extent as in ferrets, and in view of the serum halflife of up to 20 days for IgG1 in human beings, one intramuscular administration of CR3014 at the dose used in this study should protect an adult for the length of at least one to two SARS coronavirus incubation periods (median 4-6 days). Passive immunisation with CR3014 might, therefore, be a feasible approach to prevent lung manifestations in people exposed to SARS coronavirus, and prevent person-to-person spread of the virus by abolishment of viral shedding in pharyngeal secretions.

However, Huang and colleagues' report mainly focused on non-pregnant adults. Urgent questions that need to be addressed promptly include whether pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia will develop distinct symptoms from non-pregnant adults, whether pregnant women who have confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia are more likely to die of the infection or to undergo preterm labour, and whether COVID-19 could spread vertically and pose risks to the fetus and neonate. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (approval number 2020004). Written informed consent was obtained from each enrolled patient. We reviewed clinical records, laboratory findings, and chest CT scans for all nine pregnant women. All information was obtained and curated with a customised data collection form. Two study investigators (JG and XY) independently reviewed the data collection forms to verify data accuracy. Maternal throat swab samples were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Kit (BioGerm, Shanghai, China), following WHO guidelines for qRT-PCR. All samples were processed at the State Key Laboratory of Virology/Institute of Medical Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, for further testing. Sample collection, pro cessing, and laboratory testing complied with WHO guidance. Other symptoms included cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two). No severe neonatal asphyxia was observed. Based on data from this small group of patients, there is currently no evidence of vertical transmission in pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in the third trimester. Continuous variables were directly expressed as a range. Categorical variables were expressed as number (%). The funding agencies did not participate in study design, data collection, data analysis, or writing of the report. The final version was approved by all authors. The two patients with a normal body temperature before caesarean section both had postpartum fever (range 37·8-39·3°C). Additionally, one patient showed obvious gastrointestinal symptoms. All patients were given oxygen support (nasal cannula) and empirical antibiotic treatment. We report clinical data from nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. 2 None of the nine patients developed severe pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Four of the nine patients had preterm labour. Furthermore, the time period from onset of COVID-19 pneumonia to admission was only 3 days for this patient; therefore we reasoned that the fetal intrauterine growth restriction was more likely to be a symptom associated with pre-eclampsia. Importantly, all nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and 5-min Apgar score of 9-10. Notably, all the samples tested in our study were collected in the operating room at the time of the caesarean section, thus guaranteeing that the samples were not contaminated and best represented fetal intrauterine conditions. Nonetheless, this single case of an infected neonate suggests that we should pay special attention to prevent infections in newborn babies born to mothers with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study is limited by the small sample size and retrospective method. Several considerations should be taken into account when interpreting the findings. First, all enrolled patients were in the third trimester. Fourth, whether COVID-19 could damage the placenta, which represents an important link in vertical transmission, also needs to be further investigated. We found no evidence for vertical transmission in late pregnancy. CW participated in drafting the manuscript, and revising it on the basis of reviewers' comments.

29,29,78db66c751c49e72612fd9ba978495871d917912,,H5N1 infection of the respiratory tract and beyond: a molecular pathology study,"Background Human infection with avian infl uenza H5N1 is an emerging infectious disease characterised by respiratory symptoms and a high fatality rate. Previous studies have shown that the human infection with avian infl uenza H5N1 could also target organs apart from the lungs.
 We studied post-mortem tissues of two adults (one man and one pregnant woman) infected with H5N1 infl uenza virus, and a fetus carried by the woman. In-situ hybridisation (with sense and antisense probes to haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein) and immunohistochemistry (with monoclonal antibodies to haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein) were done on selected tissues. Reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR, real-time RT-PCR, strand-specifi c RT-PCR, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplifi cation (NASBA) detection assays were also undertaken to detect viral RNA in organ tissue samples.
 Interpretation In addition to the lungs, H5N1 infl uenza virus infects the trachea and disseminates to other organs including the brain. The virus could also be transmitted from mother to fetus across the placenta.","A pandemic outbreak of human infection with avian infl uenza H5N1 currently poses a potentially serious health threat worldwide. Since the outbreak of infection with avian infl uenza H5N1 virus in 2003, WHO has reported 277 laboratory confi rmed cases in ten countries with a mortality rate of about 60%. 1 So far the virus has spread only from animals to human beings. However, human-to-human transmission potentiated by viral genomic mutation and reassortment of genomic subunits could be imminent. Recently, the fi rst cases of probable human-to-human transmission have been reported. 2, 3 The H5N1 infl uenza A virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus in which the genome consists of eight segments encoding ten viral proteins including haemagglutinin, neuraminidase, polymerase proteins, and nucleoprotein. 4 Little is known about the specifi c eff ects in organs and cells targeted by the virus. The infection initially seemed to be restricted to the lungs, but later reports 5, 6 have suggested that infl uenza A H5N1 could disseminate beyond the lungs. For various reasons (eg, religion), full autopsies of H5N1-infected human cases can often not be obtained. Accordingly, only a few reports 2,5,7-9 have described histopathology and virus distribution in H5N1 cases. Studies using in-situ hybridisation to detect viral genomic sequences in target cells have not been reported thus far.
 We present clinicopathological data from H5N1 autopsies of two unrelated Chinese cases, as well as the histopathological changes and pattern of infection in the placenta and fetus from one of the patients, who was pregnant at the time of death. To gain further insight into the tissue tropism of infl uenza A H5N1 virus, we used in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry to analyse viral localisation in various organs. Reverse transcription (RT) PCR, real-time RT-PCR, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplifi cation (NASBA) H5 detection assays were also done to detect viral RNA in tissue samples, as well as strand-specifi c RT-PCR.
 The clinical data of patient 1 have previously been published in detail. 10 A 24-year-old Chinese woman from China's Anhui province who was 4 months pregnant presented with a 6-day history of fever, cough, and dyspnoea. 2 weeks before admission, she had handled birds, several of which had died. On admission, she was lymphopenic, confused, and irritable, had bilateral infi ltration on chest radiograph, and substantially reduced oxygen saturation. She was placed on a ventilator and treated with antibiotics, corticosteroids (hydrocortisone 400 mg on day 6 and day 7, and methylprednisolone 160 mg on day 8 and 240 mg on day 9), and fl uids, but died 62 h after admission, 9 days after the onset of symptoms. No antiviral treatment was given. *Contributed equally to the study as fi rst authors Patient 2 was a 35-year-old Chinese man from China's Jiangxi province who had a 6-day history of fever and productive cough. He had participated in selling birds, of which several had died. On admission, chest radiographs showed evidence of pneumonia, and laboratory results showed abnormally increased hepatic-associated and cardiac-associated enzymes and lymphopenia. He was treated with antibiotics. Corticosteroids were given initially with methylprednisolone 40 mg on day 10 and then 120 mg per day for 17 days. Antiviral treatment was given, including rimantadine 100 mg twice daily on days 10 and 11 and then oseltamivir 150 mg per day from day 11 for 10 days. After admission, he became increasingly irritable and confused, followed by lowered consciousness. He developed respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation was initiated. In a sputum culture, several gram-positive microorganisms and Candida albicans were isolated. Antifungal drugs were added to his treatment. He developed multiple organ failure and died 27 days after the onset of symptoms.
 The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention confi rmed human infection with avian infl uenza H5N1 in both patients. RT-PCR detected H5N1 viral sequences in nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates, which were obtained on day 6 of illness for patient 1 and day 10 for patient 2. Viruses were isolated from the nasopharyngeal aspirate cultures, and designated as infl uenza A/Anhui/1/2005 virus 10 in patient 1 and A/Jiangxi/1/2005 virus in patient 2. The haemagglutinin genes of viruses in patient 1 (GenBank accession number: DQ371928) 10 and patient 2 (webappendix) 11 were sequenced. The receptor-binding sites of both viruses were identical to those of previous H5N1 isolates. 12 H5N1 viruses isolated from both patients were susceptible to both the M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine, and the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir.
 Both cadavers were stored at 4ºC and underwent autopsy about 18-20 h after death. The autopsies were done following conventional protocols and strict safety procedures. 13 Tissue samples from all major organs and tissues were taken and fi xed in 4% formalin. The brain of patient 1 was not available for investigation.
 Immunohistochemistry was done on the basis of the technique of Lin and colleagues, with antigen retrieval by a standard technique. 14, 15 To detect viral antigen, tissue slides of 4 μm thickness were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies to nucleoproteins and haemagglutinin. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies to the following cell markers were used: CD68 (for macrophages), CD3 (T lymphocytes), CD20 (B lymphocytes), CD8 (cytotoxic T cells), S100 (dendritic cells), cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (epithelial cells), surfactant protein A (type II pneumoncytes), tubulin-β (ciliated epithelial cells), placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP, syncytiotrophoblasts), E-cadherin (cytotrophoblasts), 16 neurofi lament (neurons), neuron-specifi c enolase (neurons), and factor VIII (endothelial cells, webtable). 17 For controls, we used unrelated antibodies in place of the primary antibody.
 For the development of probes, we used haemagglutinin (GenBank accession number DQ100556) and nucleoprotein gene sequences (DQ100560) of the H5N1 A/black-headed gull/Qinghai/1/2005 virus, which was recently isolated from a migratory bird at China's Qinghai lake. 18 Plasmids were generated by cloning of the full haemagglutinin gene (1779 bp) and full nucleoprotein gene (1565 bp) into a plasmid vector PGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) yielding pGEM-HA for haemagglutinin and pGEM-NP for nucleoprotein. Both plasmids were linearised with appropriate restriction enzymes. Two sense and two antisense RNA probes were prepared by in-vitro transcription with T7 and Sp6 RNA polymerase (Promega) in the presence of digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). Since H5N1 is a negative-stranded RNA virus, sense probes were defi ned as the probes that detect the viral RNA (negative-stranded), whereas antisense probes detected mRNA and complement RNA (cRNA), which are both positive-stranded.
 Briefl y, before hybridisation, all solutions were prepared with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. 19 After deparaffi nisation and rehydration, tissue sections of 4 μm thickness were treated with proteinase K digestion or microwave heating. Tissue sections were then incubated with a hybridisation cocktail containing 50 μg/mL of one of the four sense and antisense probes at 45ºC for 16 h. All sense and antisense probes were applied separately on consecutive tissue sections. After blocking with horse serum (1:100), sections were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labelled digoxigenin antibody (1:500, Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) for 1 h, and the reaction products were colourised with nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-choloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega).
 As a positive control, we used brain tissue samples of a black-headed gull, for which H5N1 infection of the brain was confi rmed by viral isolation. 18 We used lung tissues from a mouse infected with H9N2 infl uenza virus as a negative control. Negative controls also included an unrelated antisense probe against the fragment of the polymerase gene (R1AB) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 20 as well as H5N1 in-situ hybridisation probes to tissues (including lung and tracheal) obtained from seven adults who died from infectious lung diseases other than H5N1 infl uenza (four, SARS; one, purulent bronchitis; two, pneumonia), one adult who died from a non-infectious disease (gastric ulcer), one pregnant woman who died from an amniotic embolism, and one aborted fetus.
 We identifi ed the cell types infected by the virus with double labelling by combining in-situ hybridisation for See Online for webappendix See Online for webtable viral genomic sequences and immunohistochemistry for one of the cell-associated markers. To identify placental cells and cerebral neurons containing viral sequences or antigens, consecutive sections adjacent to the sections used for in-situ hybridisation or immunohistochemistry were immunostained with CD68, E-cadherin, PLAP, neurofi lament, or neuron-specifi c enolase. Tissues from the pharynx, nose and paranasal sinuses, and lymph nodes other than hilar nodes were not available for investigation.
 On preliminary investigation of lung tissues, we noted a contrast between the extent of histological damage and the limited number of positive pneumocytes (patient 1) or absence of positive pneumocytes (patient 2) shown by in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry studies. Therefore, we did extensive pulmonary sampling for further histological assessment to ensure that the results were representative.
 After receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virus, the polymerase proteins, nucleoprotein, and encapsidated RNA segments migrate to the nucleus of the infected cell. In the nucleus, RNA segments are transcribed into mRNA and cRNA. mRNA is subsequently translated to viral proteins (eg, haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein) in the cytoplasm. Newly synthesised nucleoprotein is transported back to the nucleus. cRNAs function as antigenomic templates for the production of progeny RNA segments in the nucleus. Assembly of progeny gene segments and proteins occurs in the cytoplasm. 4 Therefore, sense and antisense signals after in-situ hybridisation for nucleoprotein and haemagglutinin could be seen in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells, as well as immunohistochemical signals for nucleoprotein in the nucleus and for haemagglutinin in the cytoplasm. Since antisense probes hybridise to mRNA and cRNA, a positive signal would probably indicate active viral replication.
 RNA was extracted from deparaffi nised tissue samples, or directly extracted from formalin-fi xed tissues after overnight incubation with proteinase K (10 µg/µL, Ameresco, Cleveland, OH, USA). We did RNA extraction with Trizol (Invitrogen, CA, USA), and PCR as previously described. 21 The haemagglutinin gene of the H5N1 virus was detected with H5for as the forward primer and H5rev as the reverse primer for H5 gene amplifi cation (panel). Reamplifi cation was done for specifi c samples with the same set of primers if no band was seen in gel electrophoresis. We obtained negative controls for RT-PCR from uninfected tissues (eg, lung, brain, placenta, and intestine) from three patients who died from non-infectious diseases.
 RT-PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was assessed in parallel as an internal control.
 To detect viral RNA in fetal tissues, real-time RT-PCR (H5 avian infl uenza virus Nucleic Acid Amplifi cation Fluorescent Quantitative Detection Kit, PG Biotech, Shenzhen, China) was used as recommended by the manufacturer and the national standards of the People's Republic of China.

Strand-specifi c RT-PCR was undertaken on the basis of the technique of Yue and co-workers, 22 with minor modifi cation. Briefl y, two-part reactions were used.

 Virus-specifi c RNA was also detected with the avian infl uenza virus (H5 subtype) NASBA diagnostic test kit (MP version, Hong Kong DNA Chips, Hong Kong). The test was done as previously described 23 with H5-specifi c capture and detection probes (panel). Absorbance of the amplifi ed product was measured at 405 nm by an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). A negative control from the test kit was also included for H5 detection. The study was approved by the internal review board and ethics committee of the Peking University Health Science Centre.

 The microscopic features of both patients were similar, apart from more extensive fi broproliferative changes in the lungs of patient 2. Both lungs of patient 1 showed features of diff use alveolar damage (fi gure 1A) and focal desquamation of epithelial cells into alveolar spaces without evidence of type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. In the lungs of patient 2, patchy foci of consolidated bronchopneumonia and areas of fi brosis were seen. We found variable numbers of macrophages in the alveoli (especially in patient 2), and moderate numbers of scattered neutrophils and rare lymphocytes in the interstitial spaces. Both patients had substantially depleted lymphoid tissue in the spleen, lymph nodes, and mucosal lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract. The liver in both patients had spotty necrosis. In both patients, we detected very low numbers of macrophages with haemophagocytosis in the spleen, lymph nodes, and liver. The kidneys showed extensive tubular necrosis. Other organ systems showed no pronounced histological changes, apart from hypertrophy in the thymus of patient 2.
 The placenta showed development appropriate for the length of gestation. We saw scattered foci of syncytiotrophoblast necrosis, sometimes with associated dystrophic calcifi cation. Whether this fi nding was induced virally or was the sole result of maternal shock is unclear. Acute necrotising deciduitis was detected focally, and regarded as consistent with maternal shock.
 Fetal tissues mostly showed no specifi c histopathological fi ndings, and development was also consistent with gestational age. However, sections of fetal lung showed oedema and very small numbers of scattered interstitial neutrophils, which raised the possibility of mild acute interstitial pneumonitis, although this appearance was notably less severe than that seen in patients 1 and 2 (webfi gure 1).
 Sense and antisense probes for in-situ hybridisation detected viral genomes focally in tissue samples from various organs (table 1). The two sets of probes (for In the respiratory tract, we detected positive signals in tracheal epithelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells (fi gures 1B and 1C, webfi gure 1). However, only an estimated 10-20% of epithelial cells in the trachea and about 5% of epithelial cells in the alveoli showed positive signals. Both bronchi and bronchioles were negative. Double labelling combining in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry with tubulin-β antibody showed that both ciliated (tubulin-β-postive) cells and non-ciliated (tubulin-β-negative) cells of the trachea had viral sequences (fi gure 1C, webfi gure 2). We also found putative basal cells to be infected. Double labelling with antibodies for cytokeratin and surfactant protein A showed that the positive alveolar cells were type II pneumocytes (webfi gures 1C and 1D). In-situ hybridisation showed no positive staining in endothelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, fi broblasts, or any other cell type in the lungs or blood. However, we found positive viral signals in the cytoplasm of mononuclear cells in hilar lymph nodes (fi gure 1D). Double labelling and consecutive sections showed that cells positive for in-situ hybridisation were T lymphocytes (ie, positive for CD3 and negative for CD68, CD20, and S100, webfi gure 3). Additionally, positive signals of intracytoplasmic viral sequences were present in mucosal epithelial cells of the small intestine (>50% in some intestinal segments, fi gure 1E). We also detected viral sequences in the cytoplasm (and to a much lesser extent in the nuclei) of brain cells from patient 2 (fi gure 1F, webfi gure 1). Double labelling with neural markers neurofi lament or neuron-specifi c enolase showed that these H5N1-positive cells were neurons (webfi gures 1O and 1P). Table 2 shows the topographic distribution of cells with positive signals from in-situ hybridisation. No positive signals were seen in the heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, oesophagus, bone marrow, or stomach.
 Placental tissue samples showed a large number of infected cells in chorionic villi (webfi gure 4). Most positive cells were localised in the connective tissue core of these villi. These cells were confi rmed (by labelling with monoclonal antibodies to CD68 and PLAP in consecutive sections) to be Hofbauer cells but not syncytiotrophoblasts. A subgroup of the cells with positive signals was found in the periphery of chorionic villi (fi gure 1G), which morphologically resembled cytotrophoblastic cells and were confi rmed by immunostaining with E-cadherin antibody on consecutive sections. No positive signal was seen in syncytiotrophoblasts.
 In the fetus, in-situ hybridisation identifi ed viral sequences in the lungs, circulating mononuclear cells (webfi gure 1), and mononuclear cells in the liver (fi gure 1H). The latter cells were identifi ed as macrophages (Kupff er cells) by double labelling with antibody to CD68 (webfi gure 1). Both sense and antisense probes were Distribution of immunohistochemical staining (table 1) was consistent with that of in-situ hybridisation, apart from the absence of viral antigens in the intestines. Positive staining for nucleoprotein and haemagglutinin was detected in pneumocytes (fi gure 2A) and cytotrophoblasts and Hofbauer cells in the placenta (fi gure 2B) in patient 1; as well as in tracheal epithelial cells (fi gure 2C), the brain (fi gure 2D), and T lymphocytes in hilar lymph-node tissue (fi gure 2E) in patient 2. The fetus showed positive staining in bronchial epithelial cells, pneumocytes (fi gure 2F), and circulating mononuclear cells. Nucleoprotein was mainly detected in the nucleus and haemagglutinin in the cytoplasm. Negative controls validated the specifi city of the immunohistochemistry protocol (webfi gure 5).
 All organs tested showed positive RT-PCR results, apart from the lymph nodes of patient 2 (tables 2 and 3, fi gure 3). All non-paraffi n-embedded samples were positive for H5 expression. However, paraffi n-embedded tissues only showed H5 expression after reamplifi cation of the RT-PCR products. NASBA showed positive results on both types of samples without the need of reamplifi cation.
 With real-time RT-PCR, viral RNA was detected in the lungs and liver of the fetus (table 3) . GAPDH was an internal control for successful RNA extraction in these assays. Positive-stranded RNA was detected in the heart and placenta of patient 1 and in the lungs, trachea, intestines, and brain of patient 2 (table 3, fi gure 3). The specifi cities of the RT-PCR and NASBA were further confi rmed by use of the negative controls.
 Our comprehensive investigation of the tissue tropism of H5N1 infl uenza virus, based on two adult autopsies and one fetal autopsy, focuses on the localisation of viral genomic sequences and antigens. We present evidence suggesting that the virus disseminates beyond the respiratory system. In addition to the lungs, viral sequences and antigens were found in the cerebral neurons and lymphocytes.
 Presence of viral sequences and antigens in the CNS is consistent with the recent isolation of H5N1 virus from cerebrospinal fl uid of a boy who died from encephalitis 6 with neurological symptoms commonly seen in patients with H5N1 infl uenza (Gao Zh, unpublished), including the two cases in this study. Brain neurons were found to be infected by the virus. We also saw regional variations in positive neuronal distribution and negative neurons next to positive neurons. Possible reasons might include diff ering densities of the avian infl uenza virus receptor in human beings, diff erences in blood supply pathways and nerve connections that allow virus-target cell contact, and diff ering viral loads and viral replication stages. The detection of positive-stranded RNA by RT-PCR and in-situ hybridisation could indicate active viral replication in the brain. The virus could reach the CNS by penetrating the blood-brain barrier or by invading the aff erent fi bres of the olfactory, vagal, trigeminal, and sympathetic nerves after replicating in the respiratory mucosa, as has been shown in animals. 24 See Online for webfi gure 5

Our data imply that the virus also infects and actively replicates in the small intestines, which is consistent with previous studies. 5 The origin of infection in the intestines could be blood-borne, which is lent support by previous studies isolating live H5N1 virus from the serum 6 and plasma. 25 However, ingestion of infected respiratory secretion cannot be excluded as a possible route of infection, since H5N1 infl uenza viruses maintain sialidase activity despite the low pH in the upper digestive tract. 26 Although in-situ hybridisation, NASBA, and RT-PCR detected viral RNA in the intestines, immunohistochemistry for viral antigens was negative. This discrepancy is consistent with the fi ndings of Uiprasertkul and colleagues, 5 although the reason is still unclear.
 In-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry detected viral sequences and antigens in lymphocytes in the lymph nodes, and fetal macrophages in the placenta. Circulating mononuclear cells in the fetus and macrophages in the liver were found to harbour viral sequences. Previous in-vitro experiments have shown infection of macrophages by H5N1, 27,28 and ex-vivo experiments have shown that the virus attaches to alveolar macrophages in human lung tissue. 29 In addition to viraemia, infected immune cells could also carry the virus to extrapulmonary organs, which has been thought to participate in the pathogenesis of SARS. 20 The virus localised to type II pneumocytes in the respiratory tract, which has also been reported previously. 5, 29, 30 However, with double labelling, we found viral sequences and antigens in both ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells of the trachea (fi gure 1C), contrasting with previous in-vivo and ex-vivo studies. 5, 29 In cultures of human tracheobronchial epithelial cells, H5N1 infl uenza viruses have been reported to infect mainly ciliated cells, which express mainly avian infl uenza virus receptors (α-2,3-linked sialic acids), although a limited number of non-ciliated cells (<20% of all infected cells) have also been reported to be infected. 31, 32 Some studies have detected only human infl uenza virus receptors (α-2,6-linked sialic acids) on non-ciliated cells, 32 whereas others also have found avian infl uenza virus receptors in these cells, albeit to a lesser extent. 31, 33 Changes in receptor-binding properties of A/Anhui/1/2005 and A/Jiangxi/1/2005 viruses could, in theory, also account for the infection of non-ciliated cells. However, preliminary tests have not revealed any substantial changes in the receptor-binding sites of either virus, compared with previous H5N1 isolates. 12 Notably, only a few scattered epithelial cells in the lungs were found to harbour the virus, contrasting with the severe and widespread histopathological changes in the lungs. Since this contrast was unexpected, lung tissue was sampled and analysed extensively, but the number of cells with viral localisation was consistently low in both patients. With the technique's very high detection sensitivity (close to 100%), the percentages of positive epithelial cells recorded in this study could be reasonable estimates of H5N1-infected cells. In view of the low number of infected cells in patient 1 and the absence of cells with positive signals after in-situ-hybridisation in patient 2, direct viral injury to the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract is, in our view, unlikely to cause such severe pathological changes. The lack of histopathological changes in the brain, despite our fi ndings indicating active viral replication in the region, also suggests that viral replication might not be specifi cally pathogenic. Recent in-vitro and in-vivo studies have indicated that hyperinduction of cytokines and chemokines could take part in the pathogenesis of H5N1 infl uenza. 5, 7, 8, 27, 28, 34 Despite the high number of infected cells in the fetal respiratory system, we saw no evidence of severe damage to the fetal lungs, which greatly contrasts with the extensive damage found in the adult lungs. The absence of severe pulmonary damage (ie, high numbers of infected cells) in the fetus probably indicated an immunological naive status, which would be expected to result in low concentrations of the cytokines or chemokines to which the fetal lung tissues were exposed, and thus reduce or eliminate their induction of tissue damage. This theory is supported by in-vitro experiments 27 showing that H5N1-infected neonatal macrophages express much lower amounts of chemokines than H5N1-infected adult macrophages.
 Although the intracellular distribution pattern of immunohistochemical signals conformed to our expectations, it did not for signals from in-situ hybridisation. Probes hybridised mainly in the nuclei of pneumocytes and in the cytoplasm of other organs. In mice infected with H5N1 infl uenza virus, nucleoprotein sense and antisense probes have also hybridised mainly in the cytoplasm of infected cells, although the reason for this fi nding is unclear. 24 RNA analysis with RT-PCR and NASBA assays showed that H5-specifi c RNA was present in all tissues examined apart from the lymph nodes of patient 2, for which only NASBA showed positive result. This result could be due to the higher sensitivity of NASBA than that of RT-PCR. In fact, RT-PCR needed reamplifi cation of the PCR products on the paraffi n-embedded samples, which indicated a lower detecting sensitivity than NASBA.
 RT-PCR and NASBA results were generally consistent with those of in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. However, viral RNA was also seen in viscera and some regions of the brain that showed negative results for both in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. A similar discrepancy has also been reported in a SARS study, 35 which was attributed either to very low copy numbers of RNA and protein in these organs that might not be detectable or to false-positive RT-PCR results. False-positive results might be caused by the presence of virus in blood perfusing the organs without actual viral replication in the tissue parenchyma. 35 Detection of positive-stranded RNA in the lung, heart, intestines, placenta, brain, and trachea in our study could imply that viral replication occurs in these organs. The absence of corresponding negative-stranded RNA in the lung and heart could be due to a lower detecting sensitivity of RT-PCR for negative strands than for positive strands.
 This study has shown the capacity for human vertical transmission of the H5N1 virus. Transplacental transmission of the H5N1 virus warrants careful investigation, since maternal infections with common human infl uenza virus are generally thought not to aff ect the fetus. 36 A sero-epidemiological study showed no evidence of transplacental transmission in pregnant women with human infl uenza infection. 37 Our placenta autopsy showed viral genomic sequences in cytotrophoblasts and resident macrophages; furthermore, the virus infected the fetus. Viraemia has been reported in avian infl uenza virus infections, 6, 25 which is by contrast with the rare occurrence of viraemia in human infl uenza virus infections. 38 Therefore, the likelihood of virus reaching the uterus and placenta is probably higher in avian infl uenza than in human infl uenza.
 The vertical transmission route of avian infl uenza virus could be similar to that of human cytomegalovirus, which also targets cytotrophoblasts and Hofbauer cells. 39 Two possible routes of transplacental transmission have been suggested: 39 transcytosis across syncytiotrophoblasts to cytotrophoblasts in chorionic villi, or via infection of invasive cytotrophoblasts in the uterine wall (which could be infected after contact with maternal blood). These infected cells subsequently transmit the virus to the anchoring chorionic villi and could then be transmitted to Hofbauer cells that enter the fetal circulation. The presence of viral sequences and antigens in cytotrophoblasts, Hofbauer cells, and circulating fetal mononuclear cells supports this theory.
 We detected viral sequences in cytotrophoblasts of chorionic villi but not in syncytiotrophoblasts. Diff erences in virus receptor expression could explain why cytotrophoblasts are susceptible to avian infl uenza virus infections but not human infl uenza virus infections.
 Both syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts have been found to lack α-2,6-linked sialic acids, 40 but whether the placenta expresses α-2,3-linked sialic acids is unknown. The relative number of infected cells in the fetal lungs, as detected by in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry, was substantially higher than in the two adults, which could be explained by the dominance of avian-infl uenza-virus receptors over human-infl uenza-virus receptors in the bronchial and alveolar epithelia during the pseudoglandular stage of lung histiogenesis (up to the 20th gestational week). 41 Despite the long duration of the disease and antiviral treatment in patient 2, viral sequences and antigens were detected in the post-mortem tissues. This fi nding is diff erent from a previous study. 7 The delayed clearance of viral antigens and sequences could be due to the immunosuppressive eff ect of the high-dose corticosteroids with which the patient had been treated for a long period before death. Since viral cultures were not done on post-mortem tissues, whether the detection of antigens and sequences indicates active viral replication is unclear. Positive results with in-situ hybridisation and RT-PCR have been reported in patients with SARS who died late in the course of disease. 20, 35, 42 However, these positive RT-PCR results have been ascribed to the presence of small amounts of residual genome, rather than to active viral replication. 35 We have shown that the H5N1 virus spreads beyond the lungs, infecting both ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells of the trachea, the placenta, T lymphocytes in lymph nodes, and cerebral neurons. We also report evidence of transplacental transmission, resulting in infection of fetal organs. These newly obtained data are important in the clinical, pathological, and epidemiological investgation of human H5N1 infection, and have implications for public-health and health-care providers.

In December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with clinical presentations greatly resembling viral pneumonia. 9 Deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Meanwhile, 59 suspected cases with fever and dry cough were transferred to a designated hospital starting from Dec 31, 2019. Since the cause was unknown at the onset of these emerging infections, the diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan was based on clinical characteristics, chest imaging, and the ruling out of common bacterial and viral pathogens that cause pneumonia. A novel coronavirus, which was named 2019-nCoV, was isolated then from lower respiratory tract specimen and a diagnostic test for this virus was developed soon after that. Respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, or bronchial aspirates were tested for common viruses, including influenza, avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using real-time RT-PCR assays approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. No published work about the human infection caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) could be identified. We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 41 laboratory-confirmed cases infected with 2019-nCoV.
 27 (66%) of 41 patients had a history of direct exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The cytokine storm could be associated with disease severity. More efforts should be made to know the whole spectrum and pathophysiology of the new disease. The median time from being transferred to a designated hospital to the blood sample collection was 4 days (IQR 2-5). Total RNA was extracted by Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (R2050; Zymo research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and 50 µL elution was obtained for each sample. 5 µL RNA was used for real-time RT-PCR, which targeted the NP gene using AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagent (AM1005; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Statistical analyses were done using the SAS software, version 9.4, unless otherwise indicated. The corresponding authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Most of the infected patients were men ( ). None of his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms. On admission, abnormalities in chest CT images were detected among all patients. Testing of respiratory specimens should be done immediately once a diagnosis is suspected. Serum antibodies should be tested among health-care workers before and after their exposure to 2019-nCoV for identification of asymp tomatic infections. However, 2019-nCoV infection also initiated increased secretion of T-helper-2 (Th2) cytokines (eg, IL4 and IL10) that suppress inflammation, which differs from SARS-CoV infection. Autopsy or biopsy studies would be the key to understand the disease. 27] [28] [29] Therefore, corticosteroids should not be routinely given systemically, according to WHO interim guidance. 33, 34 As 2019-nCoV is an emerging virus, an effective treatment has not been developed for disease resulting from this virus. First, for most of the 41 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed with lower respiratory tract specimens and no paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained to investigate the difference in the viral RNA detection rate between upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Serological detection was not done to look for 2019-nCoV antibody rises in 18 patients with undetectable viral RNA. Finally, the potential exposure bias in our study might account for why no paediatric or adolescent patients were reported in this cohort. More effort should be made to answer these questions in future studies. 37 2019-nCoV still needs to be studied deeply in case it becomes a global health threat.

30,30,de03b56ee99cfe2771a7a729f5ee5aea1aea7228,,Zoonoses 1 Ecology of zoonoses: natural and unnatural histories,"More than 60% of human infectious diseases are caused by pathogens shared with wild or domestic animals. Zoonotic disease organisms include those that are endemic in human populations or enzootic in animal populations with frequent cross-species transmission to people. Some of these diseases have only emerged recently. Together, these organisms are responsible for a substantial burden of disease, with endemic and enzootic zoonoses causing about a billion cases of illness in people and millions of deaths every year. Emerging zoonoses are a growing threat to global health and have caused hundreds of billions of US dollars of economic damage in the past 20 years. We aimed to review how zoonotic diseases result from natural pathogen ecology, and how other circumstances, such as animal production, extraction of natural resources, and antimicrobial application change the dynamics of disease exposure to human beings. In view of present anthropogenic trends, a more eff ective approach to zoonotic disease prevention and control will require a broad view of medicine that emphasises evidence-based decision making and integrates ecological and evolutionary principles of animal, human, and environmental factors. This broad view is essential for the successful development of policies and practices that reduce probability of future zoonotic emergence, targeted surveillance and strategic prevention, and engagement of partners outside the medical community to help improve health outcomes and reduce disease threats.","Pathogens shared with wild or domestic animals cause more than 60% of infectious diseases in man. 1 Such pathogens and diseases include leptospirosis, cysticer cosis and echinococcosis, toxoplasmosis, anthrax, brucellosis, rabies, Q fever, Chagas disease, type A infl uenzas, Rift Valley fever, severe acute respira tory syndrome (SARS), Ebola haemorrhagic fever, and the original emergence of HIV. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Zoonotic diseases are often categorised according to their route of transmission (eg, vector-borne or foodborne), pathogen type (eg, micro parasites, macro parasites, viruses, bacteria, protozoa, worms, ticks, or fl eas), or degree of person-to-person transmissibility. 7 The greatest burden on human health and livelihoods, amounting to about 1 billion cases of illness and millions of deaths every year, is caused by endemic zoonoses that are persistent regional health problems around the world. 2 Many of these infections are enzootic (ie, stably estab lished) in animal popu lations, and transmit from animals to people with little or no subsequent person-to-person transmission-for example, rabies or trypano somiasis.
 • Nearly two-thirds of human infectious diseases arise from pathogens shared with wild or domestic animals • Endemic and enzootic zoonoses cause about a billion cases of illness in people and millions of deaths every year, and emerging zoonoses are a rising threat to global health, having caused hundreds of billions of US dollars of economic damage in the past 20 years • Ecological and evolutionary perspectives can provide valuable insights into pathogen ecology and can inform zoonotic disease-control programmes • Anthropogenic practices, such as changes in land use and extractive industry actions, animal production systems, and widespread antimicrobial applications aff ect zoonotic disease transmission • Risks are not limited to low-income countries; as global trade and travel expands, zoonoses are increasingly posing health concerns for the global medical community • Ecological, evolutionary, social, economic, and epidemiological mechanisms aff ecting zoonoses' persistence and emergence are not well understood; such information could inform evidence-based policies, practices, and targeted zoonotic disease surveillance, and prevention and control eff orts • Multisectoral collaboration, including clinicians, public health scientists, ecologists and disease ecologists, veterinarians, economists, and others is necessary for eff ective management of the causes and prevention of zoonotic diseases
 We selected high-quality references that showed rigorous scientifi c methodologies in their research and analyses. We searched Web of Science for reviews and research articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and June 1, 2012, with the search terms ""zoonotic disease"" and ""antimicrobial resistance"", and fi ltered results for ""animals"", ""wildlife"", or ""wild animals"". We chiefl y selected publications from the past decade but did not exclude commonly referenced or highly regarded older publications. We also searched reference lists of articles identifi ed by this search and selected those we judged relevant. Review articles and book chapters are cited to provide readers with more details and more references. Non-peer-reviewed sources such as reports from the World Organization for Animal Health, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and WHO were also reviewed to provide direct information or additional supporting references. Additional references and materials were suggested by anonymous reviewers and additional reviewers invited by the authors.
 Other zoonotic pathogens can spread effi ciently between people once introduced from an animal reservoir, leading to localised outbreaks (eg, Ebola virus) or global spread (eg, pan demic infl uenza). Zoonoses made up most of the emerging infectious diseases identifi ed in people in the past 70 years which, although relatively rare compared with endemic zoonoses, are a substantial threat to global health and have caused economic damage exceeding hundreds of billions of US dollars in the past 20 years. 8, 9 Apart from the appearance of a pathogen for the fi rst time in human beings, the distinction between endemic and emerging zoonoses can be viewed as temporal or geographical. An endemic disease in one location would be regarded as an emerging disease if it crossed from its natural reservoir and entered the human or animal populations in a new geographical area, or if an endemic pathogen evolved new traits that created an epidemic (eg, drug resistance). Transmission of pathogens into human populations from other species is a natural product of our relation with animals and the environment. The emergence of zoonoses, both recent and historical, can be considered as a logical consequence of pathogen ecology and evolution, as microbes exploit new niches and adapt to new hosts. The underlying causes that create or provide access to these new niches seem to be mediated by human action in most cases, and include changes in land use, extraction of natural resources, animal production systems, modern transportation, anti micro bial drug use, and global trade. Although under lying ecological principles that shape how these pathogens survive and change have remained similar, people have changed the environment in which these principles operate. Domestication of animals, clearing of land for farming and grazing, and hunting of wildlife in new habitats, have resulted in zoonotic human infection with microorganisms that cause diseases such as rabies, echino coccosis, and the progenitors of measles and smallpox that had historically aff ected only animal populations through changes in contact and increased transmission oppor tunities from animals to people. [10] [11] [12] As human societies have developed, each era of livestock revolution pre sented new health challenges and new opportunities for emergence of zoonotic pathogens. 13 In the past few decades, accelerating global changes linked to an expanding global population have led to the emergence of a striking number of newly described zoonoses, including hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, monkeypox, SARS, and simian immunodefi ciency virus (the animal precursor to HIV). Some of these zoonoses, such as HIV, have become established as substantial new human pathogens that circulate persistently without repeat animal-to-person transmission. SARS could have established, but was contained by rapid global response to its emergence; 14 other zoonoses, such as Ebola virus and Nipah virus, have not become established because of local control eff orts or their intrinsic inability to transmit effi ciently between people. However, others such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is enzootic in rodents in many locations, cause sporadic and infrequent clusters of infections in human beings. 15 In all cases, these emerging zoonoses are defi ned by their relatively recent appearance (or detection) in a population or, in some cases, an amplifi cation of transmission that increases the incidence, prevalence, or geographical dis tribution of previously rare pathogens. 15 Emergence of a zoonosis depends on several factors that often act simultaneously to change pathogen dynamics. The capacity of a pathogen to transmit or spread in a population is commonly quantifi ed by the basic repro duction number, or R 0 (panel 1). In addition to inherent properties of the pathogen, factors aff ecting emergence or spread include environmental factors or changes in land use, human population growth, changes to human behaviour or social structure, international travel or trade, microbial adaptation to drug or vaccine use or to new host species, and breakdown in public health infrastructure. 17 With more than a billion international travellers every year, infected individuals could potentially spread zoonotic diseases anywhere in the world. Thus, with the emergence of new infectious diseases and the chronic presence of known zoonotic diseases in many low-income and middle-income countries that might or might not be adequately diagnosed or reported, zoonoses are increasingly relevant to the global medical community.
 The ability of a pathogen to transmit in a population is commonly quantifi ed by the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which can be described mathematically. Formally, R 0 is the average number of secondary cases an infected individual can cause in a specifi c population in which all individuals are susceptible. If R 0 is greater than 1, the number of cases caused by a pathogen will increase and cause an epidemic. By contrast, when R 0 is less than 1, the number of cases will diminish and the pathogen will eventually become extinct. For many pathogens, R 0 is correlated with density of susceptible hosts (and contacts between them), thus one way that a new zoonosis can fail to become endemic in people is if the human population is sparse. This straightforward relation between population density and the ability of new zoonoses to colonise people might underpin the emergence of a series of endemic diseases thousands of years ago (eg, the Egyptian plagues, smallpox, and rubella), when populations aggregated into towns or cities and thus reached the density at which R 0 for person-to-person transmission of pathogens introduced from animals exceeded 1, or could exceed 1 by evolving person-specifi c adaptations. 16 
 Understanding infectious diseases beyond the scale of individual clinical cases requires assessment of ecological and evolutionary perspectives. An epidemic is fundamentally an interaction between populations of two species, pathogen and host, and hence has formal similarities to predator-prey and other consumer-resource systems that ecologists have studied for decades. Multiyear cycles of immunising diseases such as measles have been understood by direct analogy to predator-prey cycles, and are driven by alternating periods of predator population growth (when prey are abundant) and decline (when prey are depleted). 18 Similarly, interactions between pathogen strains can be understood through assessment of principles of ecological competition: one recent study 19 explained the striking diversity of pneumococcal serotypes, and the epidemiological eff ect of the polyvalent conjugate vaccine, by interpretation of components of the acquired immune response in terms of stabilising and fi tnessequalising ecological mechanisms. Such parallels are intrinsic and pervade all aspects of infectious diseaseeven the central epidemiological concept of R 0 is borrowed from population ecology. 20 Similarities apply to both macroparasites (helminths and arthropod ectoparasites) and microparasites (viruses, bacteria, and protozoa). One diff erence is that microparasites have short generation times and can be subject to strong selection pressures from host immunity, other organisms present in the microbiome, and antimicrobial drugs, all of which are key potential components of the ecosystem in which the microbes live. As a result, pathogen evolution can occur in very short timescales; 21,22 signifi cant evolutionary changes can occur in the course of one epidemic or even during individual infections. A conspicuous example is the development of resistance in bacteria in response to antimicrobial therapy and, in a slightly longer timescale, the antigenic change in infl uenza viruses that results in the need for frequent updating of the infl uenza vaccine formulation. 23 The dynamics of zoonotic disease transmission are deeply embedded in the ecology and evolutionary biology of their hosts. A zoonosis comprises interaction between at least three species: one pathogen and two host species, with people and another animal species acting as the reservoir of the infection. For vector-borne zoonoses, 24 the ecology is complicated because the ecology of numerous other vector and reservoir host species can change transmission dynamics. 24 Directly transmitted zoonoses can also have several reservoir hosts, potentially serving diff erent roles in pathogen dynamics, such as amplifi cation or transmission to human beings. 25 For example, the zoonotic paramyxovirus Nipah virus has fruit bat reservoir hosts in Malaysia. The virus became established in domestic pig populations, amplifying viral trans mission and leading to a large outbreak in human beings in 1998-99. 26 More than 100 people died during this outbreak and more than 1 million pigs were killed to control the disease.
 Changes in abundance of animal hosts can strikingly aff ect disease incidence in people. A decrease in the abundance of a preferred animal host can cause an arthropod vector to shift feeding patterns to human beings, leading to a disease outbreak. For example, when rinderpest was fi rst introduced to east Africa, cattle and wildebeest populations depleted rapidly and tsetse fl ies switched to feeding on people, causing a large epidemic of sleeping sickness. 27 Environmental changes (including anthropogenic eff ects) might change the abundance of a wildlife reservoir host, increasing transmission within the reservoir and the risk of zoonotic transmission. El Niño events in 1991-92 and 1997-98 led to human hantavirus cases in the southwestern USA via an ecological cascade: increased precipitation caused vege tation growth, allow ing rodent densities to rise, allowing an increase in hantavirus infections in rodents. This increase did not cause population declines in rodents because, like many wildlife reservoirs of zoonotic patho gens, hantavirus causes mild or subclinical infections in this group. However, the increased prevalence in rodents increased the risk of infection in people. 28 Ecological principles also apply at the scale of individuals. Infected hosts contain a population of patho gens that grows and evolves according to the same principles as a free-living plant or animal popu lation. Processes of viral replication, immune clearance, and tissue tropism can be understood by analogy to ecological processes of reproduction, mortality, and dispersal between habitats. 29, 30 The microbial ecology of zoonotic pathogens within their reservoir hosts can be a key determinant of risk to human health. For example, feeding diff erent diets to beef cattle before slaughter leads to diff erent environmental conditions within the gut, and a shift in the balance of competition among microbial species, which can change the abundance of human pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7. 31 The ecological principle of competitive exclusion is the basis for common approaches to control of zoonotic pathogens in livestock and poultry. 32, 33 Meta-genomic studies show that the community of commensal bacteria within healthy hosts plays an important part in defence against pathogens. 34 Furthermore, disruption of this community through changes in diet or use of antimicrobials can allow the growth of other organisms, some of which might be pathogenic. This mechanism underlies diff erential susceptibility to Clostridium diffi cile infection and might also increase the risk of zoonotic infections (as reported for salmonella). 35, 36 This factor underscores the importance of study of the full microbial community within hosts (microbiome), and not just pathogens. 34
 Increasing demand for food due to an expanding global population has led to a substantial susceptibility of our populations to food-borne zoonoses. 37 Patho gens in the livestock production chain are a particular risk, with repeated outbreaks from meat, eggs, milk, and cheese, or meat byproducts incorporated into foods as fl avouring, oils, or stock. 38 Globally, most types of domesticated and wild vertebrates and many invertebrates are foods for people; such foods are capable of harbouring zoonotic bacteria, viruses, or parasites. 38 Knowledge of the ecology of many foodborne pathogens and their range of hosts is poor. When disease outbreaks occur in people, the animal source is often diffi cult to identify, restricting epidemiological investigation and ecological understanding. As for many zoonoses, foodborne pathogens often cause mild or subclinical disease in reservoir hosts, and because surveillance systems for wildlife and domestic animals are not universally adequate for detection of clinical disease or pathogen presence, humans beings often act as sentinel populations for zoonoses. 39 The volume of consumption of wildlife products for food is at least an order of magnitude lower than it is for domestic livestock. 40 However, human being-animal contact associated with hunting, preparation, and consumption of wild animals has led to transmission of notable diseases. Such diseases include HIV/AIDS, which was linked to the butchering of hunted chimpanzees, 41 SARS, which emerged in wildlife market and restaurant workers in southern China, 42 and Ebola haemorrhagic fever linked to the hunting or handling of infected great apes or other wild animals. 43 All these disease transmissions are examples of organ isms or pathogens exploiting new host opportunities resulting from human behaviour. For central African countries alone, estimates of annual wild meat consumption total 1 billion kg. 4 Solutions to increased demand for bushmeat are not straightforward, and although substitution of protein from domestic animal production might seem logical, increased livestock production in developing countries without adequate disease-manage ment practices might lead to the emergence of other pathogens due to the introduction of new hosts.
 Many foodborne zoonoses are enzootic in livestock (eg, bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, and some helminth infections), especially in low-income and middle-income countries, and result in endemic infec tions and outbreaks of disease in people. Cultural and farming practices such as stocking rates, mixing of species, methods of confi nement, and feeding, and lack of proper implementation of disease-control methodsbecause of weak veterinary infrastructures and in suffi cient public-private partnerships to support and strengthen them-can serve to maintain or spread zoonotic diseases in livestock and provide a source of new infections in susceptible human populations (panel 2). 45, 46 The tech niques with which animals are slaughtered and processed, and how products are stored, packed, transported, and prepared at the place they are consumed, also enable foodborne disease outbreaks. 37 Outbreaks of trichinosis in people are often linked to the consumption of incompletely cooked meat from pigs and wild boars and, occasionally, wild game. 37 Cysticercosis (caused by the pig tapeworm Taenia solium) aff ects 50 million people every year. 2 Echinococcosis (caused by the larval stages of the dog tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus for which ungulates serve as the intermediate host) aff ects 200 000 people every year, resulting in relative economic impacts equivalent to US$4·1 billion annually for treatment and control in humans and animals. 6 Other notable foodborne parasites include trematodes (liver, lung, and intestinal fl ukes), which are a neglected disease group despite contributing to a sub stantial disease burden in southeast Asia and posing a serious impediment to public health and economic prosperity in the region. 47
 Although smallholder herds and fl ocks remain important for the livelihoods and food security of millions of people, intensifi cation of livestock production is rapidly occurring worldwide. This process has inherent advantages in terms of increased productivity, economies of scale, ease and effi ciency of surveillance, and application of herd health. However, ecological risks of intensifi ed production (eg, increased host density and contact rates, reduction of genetic diversity within populations, and selection of genetic stock for improved feed conversion rather than disease resistance) without eff ective disease-control practices, were shown by the emergence of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza A H5N1. This form of avian infl uenza evolved from a less virulent strain in domestic poultry to become very virulent, probably as a result of increased mixing between fl ocks and species in an environment where biosecurity improvements have not kept pace with the rate of livestock intensifi cation. 44 The organism expanded its geographical range through various movement and marketing practices, contamination of inanimate objects and environments, and in some cases transmission back to migratory birds. 44 More than 579 cases of H5N1 infl uenza in people have been reported globally, resulting in 341 deaths, and more than 230 million birds have been killed by the disease or culled in counter-epizootic measures. However, the virus continues to circulate in avian populations. More eff ective control of this disease in poultry, such as improved surveillance, prevention, and response programmes, could have prevented cases of disease in people and protected livelihoods.
 Many zoonoses can be linked to large-scale changes in land use that aff ect biodiversity and relations between animal hosts, people, and pathogens. Land modifi cation, irrespective of reason, changes vegetation patterns, vector and host species dynamics (eg, abundance, distri bution, and demographics), microclimates, and human contact with domestic and wild animals. All these factors are crucial in disease ecology. The eff ects have been well studied and described for vector-borne diseases such as malaria and Lyme disease. 48 In northeastern USA, a historical cycle of deforestation, reforestation, and habitat fragmentation changed predator-prey popu lations and led to the emergence of Lyme disease. 24 Prevalence of human alveolar echinococcosis (caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, a tapeworm of wild and domestic canids, with small mammals serving as inter mediate hosts) in Tibet is correlated with overgrazing and degradation of pastures and the resulting increase in small mammal densities. 49 In tropical regions, changes in land use have been linked to the occurrence of Chagas disease, 50 yellow fever, 51 and leishmaniasis. 51 Such changes are particularly intense in tropical regions where primary forest is opened up to mining, logging, plantation devel opment, and oil and gas extraction. This deforestation poses a threat to global health because many of these regions are emerging disease hotspots-rich in wildlife biodiversity and probably rich in the diversity of microbes, many of which have not yet been encountered by people. 8 Increased access to tropical forests for these extractive industries might increase the risk of zoonotic disease by changing habitat and vector community com position, modifying the distribution of wildlife popu lations and domestic animals, and increasing exposure to pathogens through increased human contact with animals. 48, 50 Human contact with wildlife is increased on a large scale through road building, establishment of settlements, and increased mobility of people, and the extractive process itself. 51 Where these changes take place, hunting, consumption, and trade in wildlife for food often increases. 4, 52 If sites are poorly managed, increased populations can strain existing infrastructure, leading to overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, improper disposal of waste, and a lack of potable water. 53 All of these changes increase the risk of cross-species trans mission of pathogens, resulting in zoonotic disease. Additionally, new human inhabitants (recent immi grants) might not have immunity to zoonotic diseases endemic to the area, making them particularly sus ceptible to infection.
 Extractive industry companies often have to do assessments of the environmental and social eff ect of their processes. However, assessments of the health eff ect that include principles of disease ecology are rarely done because standard operating procedures in develop ing countries and specifi c laws or regulations often do not require an assessment for health risks at a community level. 54 Furthermore, although some guidelines include zoonotic disease from domestic animals in their intended scope, few adequately address the range of potential zoonotic pathogens.
 Antimicrobial resistance is an important clinical problem in veterinary and human medicine. Better regulation of antimicrobial use in animals and more judicious use by human beings is needed than exists at present. 55 Use of antibiotics is the most direct mechanism for the evolution of antimicrobial-resistant infectious diseases in people. However, because many organisms carried by livestock are zoonotic and the transmission of drug-resistant genetic material between bacterial populations by phages can occur by other means, the widespread use of antimicrobial drugs for prophylaxis and as growth promoters in livestock production has led to worries about a possible route for the emergence of antibiotic resistance in people. 56 From an ecological perspective, antimicrobial resistance is a natural occurrence; genes conferring resistance probably originated as an evolutionary response to antimicrobial drugs produced by free-living bacteria, fungi, and plants to protect themselves from infection or competition (panel 3). 63, 64 The early antibiotics used in human medicine were all derived from natural bacterial and fungal sources. In turn, the use of these compounds would have resulted in selection for resistance in bacteria, and horizontal transfer via transposons and plasmids allowed these genes to spread rapidly through microbial populations and communities. Resistance is emerging today on the same evolutionary principles. Microbial populations are adapting subject to the same forces of competition and selection, but the current widespread use of antimicrobial agents in people far exceeds that of any time since their development as drugs.
 Increased intensifi cation of livestock production during the 20th century led to problems with infectious diseases that transmitted easily in dense host populations. In response, agricultural industries introduced a range of antimicrobial drugs because of their prophylactic qualities. 65 Some of these antibiotics are also used extensively in animal feed, to enhance growth rates, improve feeding effi ciency, and decrease waste pro duction of animals. 66 Whether or not the use of antibiotics in agriculture has exacerbated drug resistance in people has been debated widely. 67 Farmworkers exposed occu pationally to antibiotics have an increased prevalence of resistant gut bacteria, and resistant pathogens of relevance to human medicine-including meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-have been identifi ed in farm animals, although the transfer of these bacteria from people to farm animals is also a plausible explanation. 56, 68 Several pathways exist through which antimicrobial-resistant zoonotic pathogens could be transmitted from livestock to people, including through food consumption, direct contact with treated animals, waste management, use of manure as fertiliser, faecal contamination of run-off , movement of fomites through water and wind, and translocation or migration of animals. 63, 69, 70 Moreover, 30-90% of veter inary anti biotics are excreted after administration to livestock, mostly in unmetabolised form, presenting a direct route for environmental contamination. 56, 69 Although known to occur, the extent of transfer of antimicrobial-resistant organisms from animals to people is unclear. 56 Reduction of the use of antimicrobial drugs in animals might not be a complete solution, because diversity in antimicrobial resistance in people is unlikely to be always related to geographical overlap with livestock. 71 Furthermore, the potential for reversal of resistance is unknown, as is whether it would occur in clinical settings after a change in antimicrobial use. Substantial reductions in levels of resistant strains have been shown after termination of drug use, 67 although persistence has been noted. 72 Thus, reversion to drug susceptibility probably depends on occurrence of natural dilution of microbial populations with susceptible strains and fi tness costs of resistance. 72
 The continuing eff ect of the HIV/AIDS pandemic is a reminder of the risk of zoonotic pathogens spreading from their natural reservoirs to man. What is far less broadly appreciated is that none of the approaches commonly used to search for potential new human pathogens-such as tracing back the source host of a human disease-probably would have identifi ed simian immunodefi ciency virus as a potential risk to man. Thus, bold new approaches are needed. 73 According to estimates from the UN, the global population will be more than 9 billion by 2050, and more than half the global population already lives in urban areas. Changes to food production systems provide more food security for growing populations, but also change zoonotic disease risks in ways that challenge disease control. The eff ect of endemic zoonotic diseases results in an annually recurring burden to the health and livelihoods of people worldwide, but disproportionately burdens low-income and middle-income countries. 2, 5 Costs of zoonotic diseases are not restricted to expenses of human or animal treatment and control eff orts. The disruptions to commerce and society caused by disease outbreaks can account for a large share (and in some cases almost all) of the economic costs from disease. For example, SARS cost an estimated $30-50 billion despite causing illness in fewer than 9000 people. 9 Understanding the ecology of zoonotic diseases at the human being-animal interface is a complex challenge. It requires knowledge of animal and human medicine, ecology, sociology, microbial ecology, and evolution, and the underlying issues that drive increased trans mission of pathogens in humans, wildlife, and live stock: an idea described as a One Health perspective. 13, 40 Meeting the challenge will also require an under standing of how the environment is changing, and how these changes aff ect microbial dynamics across the system. Therefore, pre vention and
 Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria occur in many wild mammals and birds in numerous geographical locations. [57] [58] [59] Although such bacteria are expected to exist wherever they are exposed to antimicrobials naturally produced by bacteria, fungi, or plants, resistance noted in wildlife can also be a result of either transmission of resistant organisms from domestic animals or people, or anthropogenic contamination of the environment with antimicrobials or their metabolites. Analysis of genes conferring antimicrobial resistance from bacteria found in non-human primates, people, and livestock shows that resistant bacteria from non-human primates that live close to people and livestock are genetically more similar than are bacteria found in non-human primates from areas with little or no geographical overlap with people and livestock. 60 The study also shows the natural occurrence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms and similarities in resistance patterns where wildlife, livestock, and people are in contact.
 Studies of antimicrobial resistance in faecal Escherichia coli from rodents on pig and poultry farms in the UK suggested that resistance patterns, and the genes encoding resistance, are much the same in both wildlife and livestock (Bennett M, unpublished). Another study showed diff erent patterns of resistance in E coli in bank voles (Myodes glareolus), wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), and cattle on dairy farms in the UK. 61 Moreover, prevalence of vancomycin resistance in E coli between these two rodent species changes throughout the year. 61, 62 This fi nding suggests that, whatever the original sources of resistant bacteria and genes, diff erences in the ecology of wildlife species (eg, their diet and physiology) produce selection pressure on the microbes, rather than diff erential exposure to anthropogenic antimicrobials or presence of diff erent resistant strains in the environment.
 The dynamics of antimicrobial resistance in wildlife, both naturally occurring and arising from anthropogenic infl uences, are not well established. Long-term multicentre studies could provide an improved understanding of natural variation, changes with time, and interspecies transfer. In addition to observational studies, experimental work with wildlife could provide valuable insights to understanding of population and community eff ects of antimicrobial use and persistence of changes. response to zoonotic diseases and elimin ation or mitigation of transmission routes to prevent their emergence will need multi sectoral collaboration. 5, 40 Because zoonoses aff ect developed and developing countries alike, and spread readily across national boundaries, mitigation and control needs collaboration between ministries of health, environment and agriculture, and inter governmental agencies involved in health, trade, food production, and the environment. Inter national disease-prevention eff orts will be enhanced by the implementation of WHO's International Health Regulations, which allow for reporting of a broad range of human disease events, and through support of imple mentation of international standards for animal health and zoonoses produced by the World Organ ization for Animal Health, which includes reporting obligations for animal diseases including zoonoses. The need for improved veterinary services in many low-income and middle-income countries is implied by the gap in broad awareness of zoonotic diseases and their ability for detection and prevention in animals, and the ability to quantify and report their occurrences. Because disruptive eff ects to commerce and society can account for a large share of the economic costs of disease, integration of control strategies in animals into zoonotic disease control eff orts might prove more cost eff ective than would control in people alone. 74 Recent advances in understanding of patterns of zoonotic disease emergence and spread have begun to be integrated into human infectious-disease-control programmes, although substantial progress needs to be made. 75 Enhancing the role ecologists play in control programmes could include production of more accurate mathematical model outputs by collaboration with clinicians with real-time data, participation in both prospective and retrospective study design, and fi eld studies to identify key risk factors to target surveillance and interventions. 7 Collaboration between public health scientists, who normally use epidemiological techniques with human case data, and disease ecologists who often work with wildlife or livestock data to model risk in human beings, should be encouraged. These disease ecology approaches might be particularly useful in driving advances in prediction of the emergence and spread of novel zoonoses. 73 Understanding of the relation between environmental changes, wildlife population dynamics, and the dynamics of their microbes can be used to forecast risk of human infection with enzootic or endemic zoonoses (fi gure). All zoonoses have non-human reservoir hosts, and the dynamics of the pathogen in these hosts often determines the risk of outbreaks in people. This risk can vary with geography, seasons, or through multiyear cycles, and can depend on factors such as changes in land use, weather, climate, or environment. Investigations into the dynamics of zoo notic pathogens in their wildlife reservoir could act as an early warning system to better inform the risk of an outbreak in livestock or people, and reduce the number of cases of human disease. For example, satellite tracking of vegetation density correlates with breeding sites for the vector of Rift Valley fever, and has been used to successfully forecast cases of disease in human beings, and the necessity for vaccine supply. 76 These approaches can be developed further to ultimately predict the risk of future disease emergence. 73 Study of the ecological, evolutionary, social, economic, and epidemiological mechanisms that facilitate the persistence of common endemic zoonoses and those that drive zoonotic disease emergence in people has intrinsic value. Although studies of common endemic zoonoses are often underfunded and regarded as neglected tropical diseases, studies of zoonotic disease emergence are challenged because they are often intensive, retro spective, and sometimes expensive (eg, studies to understand the cause of Nipah virus emer gence or wildlife reservoirs of Ebola virus). Furthermore, emerging zoonotic disease studies are often considered as animal-focused or academic research (eg, studies to understand how dynamics of a pathogen in a wildlife host can change seasonally), when they are actually translational research eff orts essential to guide clinical or public health interventions (eg, seasonal variation in dynamics drives variation in risk to people). The complex ecology of antimicrobial resistance and foodborne zoonoses suggests new avenues for research, including an understanding of the microbiome from people and that of the animals they contact, and what causes zoonotic microbes to proliferate in some conditions. Eff ects of the use of antibiotics in animal production are not well understood, and the translation of this science could be enhanced by involvement of physicians, veterinarians, and ecologists in the design and interpretation of studies. Standardised data collection and long-term monitoring are needed, as are risk assessments for development of multidrug resistance or multibacterial infections in human beings resulting from antimicrobial use in food animals and from wild life. 63, 67, 69 Exploration of alternatives such as probiotics, diets to promote healthy or protective gastrointestinal fl ora, new methods of immune-system modulation, bacteriophages, bacterial cell wall hydro lases, and anti microbial peptides is warranted to help reduce the need for antimicrobial use in people and animals. 56, 77 Industries based on the extraction of natural resources provide materials and economic incentives, but might lead to the release of pathogens that are new to human hosts. Guidelines for safe or best practices that include ecological knowledge to reduce the risk of disease emergence or occurrence are urgently needed. Such guidelines ought to be mandated through the funding mechanisms that support large-scale development projects or be required by fi nancial insurers.
 Wide gaps in public health, veterinary and medical infrastructure, and training exist between developed and developing countries. These gaps aff ect disease prevention, surveillance, and control. Furthermore, little integration of ecological approaches in zoonotic disease prevention and control eff orts has occurred in most countries. These challenges need to be addressed urgently, and the One Health approach perhaps provides a wider, holistic view with which to achieve this aim. Although the causes and risks of zoonoses vary widely from one region or culture to the next, our global connectivity demands the attention and alertness of health professionals everywhere. That human activities are a driving force for where and how zoonoses occur not only means that improved healthcare systems are needed, but also that multisectoral, policy-level approaches should be instigated to decrease the burden of endemic zoonoses and prevent emergence of new ones.

We report the clinical and microbiological features of patients infected with infl uenza A H7N9 virus and compare genomic features of the human virus with those of the virus in market poultry in Zhejiang, China.
 Methods Between March 7 and April 8, 2013, we included hospital inpatients if they had new-onset respiratory symptoms, unexplained radiographic infi ltrate, and laboratory-confi rmed H7N9 virus infection. We recorded histories and results of haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations. We took throat and sputum samples, used RT-PCR to detect M, H7, and N9 genes, and cultured samples in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. We tested for co-infections and monitored serum concentrations of six cytokines and chemokines.We collected cloacal swabs from 86 birds from epidemiologically linked wet markets and inoculated embryonated chicken eggs with the samples. We identifi ed and subtyped isolates by RT-PCR sequencing. RNA extraction, complementary DNA synthesis, and PCR sequencing were done for one human and one chicken isolate. We characterised and phylogenetically analysed the eight gene segments of the viruses in the patient's and the chicken's isolates, and constructed phylogenetic trees of H, N, PB2, and NS genes.
 We identifi ed four patients (mean age 56 years), all of whom had contact with poultry 3-8 days before disease onset. They presented with fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics. Patients were leucopenic and lymphopenic, and had impaired liver or renal function, substantially increased serum cytokine or chemokine concentrations, and disseminated intravascular coagulation with disease progression. Two patients died. Sputum specimens were more likely to test positive for the H7N9 virus than were samples from throat swabs. The viral isolate from the patient was closely similar to that from an epidemiologically linked market chicken. All viral gene segments were of avian origin. The H7 of the isolated viruses was closest to that of the H7N3 virus from domestic ducks in Zhejiang, whereas the N9 was closest to that of the wild bird H7N9 virus in South Korea. We noted Gln226Leu and Gly186Val substitutions in human virus H7 (associated with increased affi nity for α-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors) and the PB2 Asp701Asn mutation (associated with mammalian adaptation). Ser31Asn mutation, which is associated with adamantane resistance, was noted in viral M2.
 Interpretation Cross species poultry-to-person transmission of this new reassortant H7N9 virus is associated with severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction in human beings. Monitoring of the viral evolution and further study of disease pathogenesis will improve disease management, epidemic control, and pandemic preparedness.","Infl uenza A virus is subtyped on the basis of two surface proteins, haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), which govern the viral lifecycle at cellular entry and release of virions. All subtypes of infl uenza A virus, from H1 to H16 and N1 to N9, are detected in wild water birds; H17N10 is found in bats. 1 Although most infections with these subtypes are mild or asymptomatic in avian species, outbreaks in wild birds and poultry have been associated with highly pathogenic avian infl uenza H5, and outbreaks in poultry have been associated with H7 subtypes. 1,2 Human infections are generally con-fi ned to H1, H2, and H3 subtypes, because these subtypes have affi nity for host cell receptors containing α-2,6-linked sialic acid (which occur in human beings), whereas other avian infl uenza viruses generally preferentially attach to avian host cell receptors, which contain α-2,3-linked sialic acid. Direct trans mission of avian infl uenza viruses from domestic poultry to people have been documented only for the H5N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N2, and H10N7 subtypes. 1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Human infections due to these subtypes were generally mild and manifested as conjunctivitis and upper-respiratory-tract infections, except for the H5N1 subtype, which was associated with mortality of greater than 50%, and the H7N7 subtype, which has caused one death. 1,4 Since February, 2013, a novel reassortant H7N9 virus associated with human deaths but no apparent outbreaks in poultry and wild birds has emerged in eastern China. We report on four patients with severe infection due to this H7N9 virus. We sequenced, characterised, and compared viral genomes from a patient and an epidemiologically linked wet market chicken isolate.
 Between March 7 and April 8, 2013 , we included hospital inpatients if they had new-onset respiratory symptoms, unexplained radiographic infi ltrate, and laboratory-con fi rmed H7N9 virus infection at the First Affi liated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou; Xiaoshan People's Hospital, Hanzhou; or Huzhou Central Hospital, Huzhou (all in China) . This study was approved by the institutional and haemato logical, biochemical, radiological, and micro biological investigation results into a predesigned database. We recorded patients' acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II) scores 8 and defi ned acute respiratory distress syn drome and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome on the basis of standard criteria. 9,10 Presumed incubation period was defi ned as the time between last poultry exposure and onset of symptoms. All laboratory procedures for respiratory secretions have been previously reported. 11 Briefl y, we used Taqman real-time RT-PCR under standard thermo cycling conditions to detect M, H7, and N9 genes. The primers that we used were M-forward (GAGTGGCTAAAGACAAGACCAATC), M-reverse (TTGGACAAAGCGTCTACGC), and M-probe (FAM-TCACCGTGCCCAGTGAGCGAG-BHQ1); H7-forward (AGAGTCATTRCARAATAGAATACAGAT), H7reverse (CACYGCATGTTTCCATTCTT), and H7-probe (FAM-AAACATGATGCCCCGAAGCTAAAC-BHQ1); and N9-forward (GTTCTATGCTCTCAGCCAAGG), N9reverse (CTTGACCACCCAATGCATTC) and N9-probe (HEX-TAAGCTRGCCACTATCATCACCRCC-BHQ1). The detection limit of the M, H7 and N9 RT-PCR assays was about 100 copies of RNA per mL. All samples were cultured with trypsin in the Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line for 7 days. We did immunofl uorescent antigen staining for infl uenza A nucleoprotein (D3 ultra 8 DFA, respiratory virus screening and identifi cation kit, Diagnostic Hybrid, OH, USA) under ultraviolet microscopy (Eurostar III plus, Euroimmune AG, Lubeck, Germany) in cell cultures with positive cytopathic changes. RT-PCR was used to subtype for H1, H3, H5, H9, and H7.
 We assessed patients' respiratory tract samples on admission by multiplex PCR (Luminex 200 System, Luminex, TX, USA); did ResPlex II v2.0 assays (Qiagen, Germany) to detect co-infection with respiratory syncytial virus, infl uenza B virus, parainfl uenza viruses 1-4, human metapneumo virus, enteroviruses, rhino virus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and coronaviruses NL63, HKU1, 229E, and OC43; and used PCR to detect co-infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. 12 We investigated blood, sputum, or endotracheal aspirates and urine samples bacteriologically, as clinically indi cated. Initial urine samples were tested for pneumococcal and Legionella antigens by immuno chromatographic enzyme immuno assay (Binax NOW Streptococcus pneumoniae Urinary Antigen Test and Binax NOW Legionella Urinary Antigen Test, Binax, ME, USA). We used the Luminex enzyme immunoassay (Luminex, TX, USA) to monitor six diff erent serum cytokines or chemokines-namely, interferon γ, inter leukins 2, 4, 6, and 10, and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα)-as a measure of host immunological responses.
 Cloacal swabs were collected from 20 chickens, four quails, fi ve pigeons, and 57 ducks from six epidemi ologically linked wet markets (four in Hanzhou City and two in Huzhou City, Zhejiang) and stored in viral trans port medium. The collected samples were inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs and viral replication was detected by haemadsorption, which has been previously de scribed. 13 We identifi ed and subtyped isolates by RT-PCR sequencing (we used H7-specifi c and N9-specifi c pri mers). RNA extraction, complementary DNA syn thesis, and PCR sequencing were done for one human and one chicken isolate. 13 Sequencing was done with the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit on the 3130xL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, NY, USA). We characterised and phylogenetically analysed all eight gene segments of the patient's and the chicken's isolates together with virus sequence data available from GenBank. All sequences were assembled and edited with Lasergene 6.0 (DNASTAR, WN, USA); Bioedit 7 was used for alignment and analysis of aminoacid residues. We used the MEGA software package v5.05 (Center for Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics, Biodesign Institute, AZ, USA) to construct the phylogenetic trees of H, N, PB2, and NS genes on the basis of the neighbour-joining method, with Tamura-Nei model of nucleotide substitution. The nucleotide of the HA1 region was used for analysis. Bootstrap values from 1000 replicates were calculated to assess the reliability of the phylogenetic tree. Our gene sequences are deposited in GenBank (accession numbers KC885955-62 [human isolate], KC899666-73 [chicken isolate]).

 All four patients had history of poultry contact (table 1) . The presumed incubation period ranged from 3 to 8 days (mean 5·8 days). Mean age was 56 years (table 1) . None of the patients were obese and none had upperrespiratory-tract symptoms or conjunctivitis. All patients had fever, and lower-respiratory-tract symptoms (includ ing dyspnoea, cough, and sputum), and one had prominent myalgia (table 1) . Chest radiography and CT of all patients showed multilobar patchy consolidation and diff use alveolar opacities (fi gure 1A-1F). CT of patients 1 and 4 showed ground glass changes in some areas. Mean time between onset of symptoms and respira tory failure was 9 days. Three patients were given 75 mg oral oseltamivir twice daily after tests for H7N9 virus were positive, starting a mean of 16 days after onset of symptoms onset (table 1) . All patients required respiratory support-oxygen given through nasal cannulae at presentation. Two patients needed non-invasive ventilation by con tinuous positive airway pressure, and three subsequently received mechan ical ventilation. Two patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and all received intra venous methylprednisolone (table 1) . Two patients (pa tients 1 and 3) died 4 days after intubation. The other two patients were recovering clinically and radiologically and had been successfully extubated at the time of writing (fi gure 1). 303 house hold or workplace contacts and 82 health-care workers with unprotected exposure to the four patients were put under medical surveillance but none of them became symptomatic after 14 days. Table 2 lists the results of laboratory investigations in the patients. All patients had pronounced lymphopenia at presentation. Total leucocyte counts were healthy or low at presentation, but leucocytosis with neutrophilia developed with disease progression. Three patients had thrombocytopenia at presentation. All patients' coagu lation profi les were impaired and D-dimer concentrations substantially increased with disease progression. The patients who died had persistent lymphopenia, renal Results for when the patients presented and the patients' most abnormal result during disease progression are given.

 impairment, and rising aspartate transaminase and D-dimer concentrations. Hepatic aminotransferases, C-reactive protein, and creatine kinase or lactate dehydrogenase concentrations were increased in all patients at some stage of illness; derangement was worse in those who died. Overall, serum cytokine and chemokine concentrations were substantially higher in patient 3 (who died) than in patient 2 (who survived) (fi gure 2A, 2B). Patient 3 had persistently high serum interleukin 10 concentrations (fi gure 2B) before death. RT-PCR assays of throat swab samples or sputum samples yielded positive results for H7N9 infection in all patients (table 3) . Serial samples from patient 2 were tested; throat swab samples were consistently negative, but sputum samples were positive (table 3) . H7N9 virus was isolated from respiratory specimens from patients 1, 3, and 4 in cell culture, and confi rmed by RT-PCR (in which H7-specifi c and N9-specifi c primers were used). No viral co-infections were detected by multiplex PCR, and no bacterial or fungal co-infections were detected in 14 blood cultures and 16 respiratory secretion cultures. Two of fi ve pigeons (40%), four of 20 chickens (20%), zero of four quails (0%), and zero of 57 ducks (0%) tested positive for the H7N9 virus.
 Sequence analysis of patient 3 and an epi demiologically linked chicken's H (1673 of 1683 bases [99·4%] ) and N (1394 of 1398 bases [99·7%]) genes showed that the human H7N9 isolate was almost identical to chicken H7N9 isolate. The H7 in the isolates clustered with H of the H7N3 of ducks in Zhejiang, and the isolate N9 clustered with the N of the H7N9 of wild birds in Korea (fi gure 3). The six internal genes of the isolate H7N9 are closest to those of poultry H9N2 viruses of China (fi gure 4).
 Analysis of the H7 receptor binding site showed a Gln226Leu substitution in the human isolate and a Gly186Val substitution (H3 numbering) in both human and chicken isolates (table 4). No multibasic aminoacids were noted at the proteolytic cleavage site of this H7 in either the human or the chicken isolates. Although the PB2 Glu627Lys substitution frequently detected in human H5N1 isolates was not noted, an Asp701Asn substitution was noted in the human isolate. Deletion of fi ve aminoacids in the stalk region of N9 at position 69-73 (N9 numbering) was noted in the human and chicken H7N9 isolates. We detected a premature stop codon near the C-terminus of NS1, leading to PDZ motif deletion, in all H7N9 isolates. A Ser31Asn substitution of the M2 gene associated with adamantane resistance was recorded in both isolates, but we noted no resistance mutations associated with neuraminidase inhibitors.
 We diagnosed avian infl uenza A H7N9 in all four patients (who were epidemiologically unlinked), two of whom died and two of whom were recovering at the time of writing (panel). All patients had histories of occupational or wet market exposure to poultry. The genes of the H7N9 virus in patient 3's isolate were phylogenetically clustered with those of the epidemiologically linked wet market chicken H7N9 isolate. Human and chicken isolate H7 clustered with that of H7N3 of ducks in Zhejiang, and human and chicken isolate N9 clustered with that of H7N9 of wild birds in Korea, and the six internal genes of the isolate H7N9 are closest to those of poultry H9N2 viruses of China. These fi ndings suggest sporadic poultry-toperson transmission. 
 Normal ranges: interferon γ (0·01-13·64 pg/mL); interleukin 2 (0·01-10·67 pg/mL); interleukin 4 (0·01-2·25 pg/mL); interleukin 6 (0·01-8·86 pg/mL); interleukin 10 (2·42-16·33 pg/mL); and tumour necrosis factor α (0·82-11·05 pg/mL).
 As was the case with infl uenza A H5N1 virus in 1997, 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, 15 and human coronavirus EMC in 2012, 16, 17 infection with a novel virus was suspected because the pneumonia of these patients did not respond to typical and atypical antibiotic coverage. The four patients were clustered within Zhejiang, China, within a few weeks (when migratory birds were moving north and transiting at the Yangtze River Delta). However, unlike other types of avian infl uenza aff ecting human beings, no increase in poultry deaths was noticed before the onset of human infec tions. After diagnosis of infl uenza A H7N9 infection was con fi rmed in patient 1 by RT-PCR, additional and retro spective testing of 486 patients between March 7 and April 8, 2013 , led to the discovery of three further infected patients. Similar to those infected with H5N1, our patients had few upper-respiratory-tract symptoms. 1 They presented with high fevers, lower-respiratory-tract symptoms (especially dyspnoea), and radiological features of con solidation and ground glass changes. Multiorgan in volvement was shown by abnormal results of liver and renal function tests, myalgia (with high creatine kinase concentrations suggestive of myositis), impaired coagu lation, and severe lymphopenia. Gastrointestinal symp toms were noted only in patient 1-a profi le that diff ers from that in previous reports of H5N1 or severe A H1N1 pdm09 infections. 1 Respiratory failure progressed within 3-14 days and death 1-3 weeks after onset of symptoms. However, none of these clinical, radiological, or labora tory fi ndings was pathognomonic. Oseltamivir was begun late (mean 16 days after symptom onset) because of the late presentation of respiratory failure and delay in virological diagnosis.
 Similar to the cytokine storm noted in H5N1 infection, the substantially increased concentrations of proinfl am matory and anti-infl ammatory serum cytokines and chemokines in patient 3 (who died) were compatible with the clinical severity of this novel H7N9 infection. 18 In particular, the serum concentrations of interleukin 10 were persistently increased in patient 3-a fi nding similar to that for severe A H1N1 pdm09 infection. 12 Although serial RT-PCR assays of sputum samples from patient 2 were positive for viral infection, cycle thresholds were low 15-20 days after onset of symptoms and corroborated well with decreasing serum cytokine and chemokine concentrations.
 Besides the likely absence of protection by pre-existing neutralising antibodies in the general population, the internal genes from the H9N2 virus might also contribute to the severe pathogenesis of this novel infection. Double and even triple reassortant avian H9N2 viruses were well reported, 19 and the six internal genes of the 1997 H5N1 virus originated from avian H9N2 virus. Furthermore, H9N2 and H5N1 viruses both induced prominent cytokine and chemokine activation in human macrophages and epithelial cells compared with that induced by seasonal infl uenza A H1N1 virus. 20 In previous studies, treatment with convalescent plasma or hyperimmune γ globulin seemed to improve survival of patients and therefore hyperimmune γ globulin should be considered in the treatment of severe H7N9 infection. 21 Immunomodulatory agents such as celecoxib (but not corticosteroids) improve outcomes of H5N1 infections in mice. 22 Other host factors, such as smoking and obesity, are risk factors for severe infl uenza. 23, 24 Findings from murine models challenged with infl uenza viruses suggest that smoking worsens the response of proinfl ammatory chemokine and cytokines and histological changes of infl ammatory infi ltrates and lung damage, increases viral titres, and impairs pulmonary adaptive T-lymphocyte responses to the virus. 25 Rapid virological diagnosis was established by RT-PCR of the M, H7, and N9 genes and confi rmed by viral culture in cell lines. Similar to H5N1 infection, which mainly aff ected the lower respiratory tract, sputum and endotracheal aspirates might be better than nasopharyngeal and throat swabs for detection of infl uenza A H7N9. 1 The predilection of infl uenza A H7N9 for the lower respiratory tract suggests that the virus might replicate more effi ciently there, where both α-2,3-linked and α-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors are noted. 1 α-2,3linked sialic acid was detected on non-ciliated cuboidal bronchiolar cells at the junction between the respiratory bronchiole and alveolus. A substantial number of cells lining the alveolar wall also expressed this receptor.
 The emergence of a new reassortant avian H7N9 virus causing human infections without preceding or concomitant outbreak in poultry was quite unexpected. This occurrence could be attributed to the absence of the multibasic aminoacid motif at the proteolytic cleavage site of H, which is associated with broad tissue tropism and organ dissemination and is therefore a key virulence marker of H5 or H7 subtypes of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza. 1 This multibasic cleavage site is a virulence marker in birds but is not confi rmed as a virulence marker in people. No pandemic virus has had this multibasic aminoacid motif. Wild waterfowl such as ducks and geese were the original natural reservoir (for H1-16, N1-9) 26 and provide new genes for making new virus reassortants that then infect domestic poultry, such as chickens, ducks, and geese, which are in close contact with human beings. Further adaptive genetic changes of such viruses in domestic poultry can enable transmission to people.
 The key concerns about the current outbreak of infl uenza A H7N9 virus are how the virus crosses the species barrier and whether it will further adapt to en able effi cient person-to-person transmission. Sequence analysis showed that the human H7 had aminoacid substitutions associated with increased affi nity for the human α-2,6-linked sialic acid receptor. 27 However, binding to the α-2,3-linked sialic acid receptor is likely to be retained, allowing the virus to circulate in poultry and infect human lower-respiratory-tract mucosae, which contain both types of receptor. 1 Shortening of the N stalk region of H5N1 viruses enhanced adaptation to land-based poultry. 28 An impor tant virus protein, PB2, in combination with two other viral proteins, PB1 and PA, comprise the viral RNA polymerase complex. PB2 is an important determinant of the host range and virulence of infl uenza viruses. Two aminoacids in PB2, 627Lys and 701Asn, have previously been detected in H5N1 viruses isolated from people. 18 Coupled 627Lys-701Asp or 627Glu-701Asn substitutions were thought to be important for effi cient transmission. 29 Although we did not note Glu627Lys substitution in PB2 in our human isolate, we did record Asp701Asn substitution. Another study 14 of the current H7N9 outbreak detailed three cases of infection in Shanghai and Anhui, China; the viral isolates showed Glu627Lys mutation. We noted neither genetic signature for mammalian adaptation-ie, Gln226Leu and Asp701Asn-in the chicken isolate, which suggests that this genetic adap tation might have occurred after the virus jumped from the chicken to the patient.
 Ser31Asn mutation (associated with adamantane resistance) was noted, but neuraminidase inhibitors, includ ing oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir, should still be active if given early in the course of illness. One patient did not receive any antivirals and three patients received oseltamivir more than 5 days after onset of symptoms. We do not know whether oseltamivir resistance will emerge (as was the case with the H5N1 virus) because the last H7N9-positive sample from patient 2 was not tested for oseltamivir resistance after 5 days of oseltamivir treatment. Delayed initiation of oseltamivir treatment and use of corticosteroids have been associated with slow decreases in viral load and poor outcomes. 23 In 2003, an H7N7 virus, which contained the multibasic aminoacid motif associated with virulence and the genetic marker for mammalian adaptation (Glu627Lys) caused one fatal infection in the Netherlands. 4 Other severe human infections with the H7 subtype had not been reported before the current H7N9 outbreak. Previous surveillance studies have shown the H7N3 virus to be present in domestic ducks in Zhejiang. 30 Avian H7 subtype viruses are likely to have become established in domestic poultry in Zhejiang. Interaction between newly established H7 subtypes and other avian infl uenza viruses, such as the H9N2 subtype, might have resulted in the current H7N9 strain, which has gained some ability to infect human beings. Further adaptation could lead to less symptomatic infection and more effi cient person-to-person transmission. Aggressive intervention to block further animal-to-person transmission in live poultry markets, as has previously been done in Hong Kong, should be considered. Temporary closure of live bird markets and comprehensive programmes of surveillance, culling, improved biosecurity, segregation of diff erent poultry species, and possibly vaccination programmes to control H7N9 virus infection in poultry seem necessary to halt evolution of the virus into a pandemic agent.

The clinical data of patient 1 have previously been published in detail. 10 A 24-year-old Chinese woman from China's Anhui province who was 4 months pregnant presented with a 6-day history of fever, cough, and dyspnoea. 2 weeks before admission, she had handled birds, several of which had died. Contributed equally to the study as fi rst authors Patient 2 was a 35-year-old Chinese man from China's Jiangxi province who had a 6-day history of fever and productive cough. He had participated in selling birds, of which several had died. Corticosteroids were given initially with methylprednisolone 40 mg on day 10 and then 120 mg per day for 17 days. Antiviral treatment was given, including rimantadine 100 mg twice daily on days 10 and 11 and then oseltamivir 150 mg per day from day 11 for 10 days. After admission, he became increasingly irritable and confused, followed by lowered consciousness. He developed respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation was initiated. In a sputum culture, several gram-positive microorganisms and Candida albicans were isolated. Antifungal drugs were added to his treatment. The receptor-binding sites of both viruses were identical to those of previous H5N1 isolates. Both cadavers were stored at 4ºC and underwent autopsy about 18-20 h after death. 13 Tissue samples from all major organs and tissues were taken and fi xed in 4% formalin. The brain of patient 1 was not available for investigation. For the development of probes, we used haemagglutinin (GenBank accession number DQ100556) and nucleoprotein gene sequences (DQ100560) of the H5N1 A/black-headed gull/Qinghai/1/2005 virus, which was recently isolated from a migratory bird at China's Qinghai lake. To identify placental cells and cerebral neurons containing viral sequences or antigens, consecutive sections adjacent to the sections used for in-situ hybridisation or immunohistochemistry were immunostained with CD68, E-cadherin, PLAP, neurofi lament, or neuron-specifi c enolase. In the nucleus, RNA segments are transcribed into mRNA and cRNA. mRNA is subsequently translated to viral proteins (eg, haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein) in the cytoplasm. 4 Therefore, sense and antisense signals after in-situ hybridisation for nucleoprotein and haemagglutinin could be seen in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells, as well as immunohistochemical signals for nucleoprotein in the nucleus and for haemagglutinin in the cytoplasm. Minus sign=negative.*Results presented for sense/antisense probes (identical results for nucleoprotein and haemagglutinin). †Results presented for nucleoprotein/haemagglutinin signals (nucleoprotein mainly detected in nucleus and haemagglutinin in cytoplasm).

The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had fi nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. We saw scattered foci of syncytiotrophoblast necrosis, sometimes with associated dystrophic calcifi cation. Acute necrotising deciduitis was detected focally, and regarded as consistent with maternal shock. However, only an estimated 10-20% of epithelial cells in the trachea and about 5% of epithelial cells in the alveoli showed positive signals. Both bronchi and bronchioles were negative. We also found putative basal cells to be infected. Additionally, positive signals of intracytoplasmic viral sequences were present in mucosal epithelial cells of the small intestine (>50% in some intestinal segments, fi gure 1E). Table 2 shows the topographic distribution of cells with positive signals from in-situ hybridisation. No positive signal was seen in syncytiotrophoblasts. Nucleoprotein was mainly detected in the nucleus and haemagglutinin in the cytoplasm. Negative controls validated the specifi city of the immunohistochemistry protocol (webfi gure 5). With real-time RT-PCR, viral RNA was detected in the lungs and liver of the fetus (table 3) . We also saw regional variations in positive neuronal distribution and negative neurons next to positive neurons. Samples regarded as H5-positive if absorbance higher than 0·45. Our data imply that the virus also infects and actively replicates in the small intestines, which is consistent with previous studies. 5 The origin of infection in the intestines could be blood-borne, which is lent support by previous studies isolating live H5N1 virus from the serum 6 and plasma. Probes hybridised mainly in the nuclei of pneumocytes and in the cytoplasm of other organs. 24 RNA analysis with RT-PCR and NASBA assays showed that H5-specifi c RNA was present in all tissues examined apart from the lymph nodes of patient 2, for which only NASBA showed positive result. RT-PCR and NASBA results were generally consistent with those of in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. 37 Our placenta autopsy showed viral genomic sequences in cytotrophoblasts and resident macrophages; furthermore, the virus infected the fetus. The relative number of infected cells in the fetal lungs, as detected by in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry, was substantially higher than in the two adults, which could be explained by the dominance of avian-infl uenza-virus receptors over human-infl uenza-virus receptors in the bronchial and alveolar epithelia during the pseudoglandular stage of lung histiogenesis (up to the 20th gestational week).

32,32,807479d4a1f69c19270b8ffa43b38a6c4634c9ea,,ROTAVIRUS INFECTIONS OF NEONATES,"F&aelig;cal specimens from 628 newborn babies in the nurseries of six metropolitan hospitals were examined by electron microscopy for rotaviruses. 304 babies (49%) were found to be excreting virus. All those infected were in five nurseries; viruses were not detected in specimens from the sixth nursery.
 Two nurseries were studied for 9 mo and another for 11 mo and rotaviruses were found consistently in 40-50% of stools examined. There was no seasonal variation.
 None of the neonates under the age of one day were infected but by the age of three to four days approximately 50% were excreting virus. Most of those shedding virus were symptom-free but 84 (28%) had diarrh&oelig;a. Persisting endemic rotavirus infection is apparently common in hospital nurseries in Sydney. The virus is probably transmitted by environmental spread from neonate to neonate.","WE'reported the excretion of rotaviruses by neonates in the nurseries of two large metropolitan hospitals in Sydney.' Our studies suggested that there was a high incidence of asymptomatic infection (53% in one nursery and 26% in the other) and that the virus persisted for long periods in the nurseries. Chrystie et awl. have also drawn attention to the high infection-rate and lack of symptoms in neonates in St. Thomas' Hospital, London. On the other hand, Bishop et al. 3 ,4 described outbreaks of diarrhoea in hospital nurseries which they attribute to rotaviruses.
 A high percentage of cases of enteritis in infants and young children has been shown to be associated with rotaviruses, and our initial interest in neonatal infections was stimulated by the finding of rotaviruses in five babies with diarrhoea who were less than 7 days old. However, the discovery that many symptomless neonates were excreting virus raised doubts about its role as a causative agent in diarrhoea in the very young and we have therefore extended our studies to six hospital nurseries in the greater metropolitan area of Sydney.
 Faecal specimens were collected from all babies in a particular nursery on a given day. 5 standard public hospital nurseries in widely scattered areas of metropolitan Sydney were surveyed in this manner. No baby had diarrhoea at the time of the survey. Specimens were subsequently collected from neonates with diarrhoea, a few with ""loose"" or ""mucousy"" stools, and from normal babies during outbreaks of diarrhoea. Most of the neonates were less than 7 days old. Specimens were transported to the laboratory within 24 h and stored at -20&deg;C until processed.
 A 20% w/v suspension of faeces was made in Hanks' balanced salt solution without antibiotics, mixed with an equal volume of Arklone P (trichlorotrifluoroethane), and homogenised thoroughly for 5 min. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 7000 g for 20 min and the aqueous layer removed. A portion of this aqueous layer was then centrifuged at 240 000 g for 30 min. For electron microscopy the pellet was resuspended in a few drops of distilled water, one drop of which was placed on a carbon-coated parlodion grid, allowed to dry, and then negatively stained with 3% phosphotungstic acid at pH 6-5. A Philips 201 electron microscope was used.
 Faecal specimens from 628 neonates were processed and examined for viruses. Rotaviruses were found in 304 (49%) (table i). The four groups of neonates (normal babies tested during surveys, normal babies tested during outbreaks of diarrhoea in the nurseries, those with diarrhoea, and those with mild gastrointestinal symptoms) gave excretion rates of 44%, 46%, 61%, and 45% respectively. Of the 6 nurseries 5 showed evidence of infection. In the sixth nursery no rota viruses were found during the survey or later when there were cases of diarrhoea. The difference between the percentage of positive excretors in the diarrhoea group and that in the normal-baby group is statistically significant (P<0.05).
 Very few other viral particles were found in the deposits examined by electron microscopy. 2 myxoviruslike particles, 2 coronavirus-like particles, a small 18 nm particle (possibly a parvovirus), 4 mycoplasma-like organisms, and a number of bacteriophages were the only other microorganisms seen. Attempts to isolate viruses by standard cell-culture techniques were unsuccess- More than 100 specimens were tested but no viruses were cultivated. Likewise bacteriological investigations did not reveal any pathogens.
 Age of Infection Continuing Presence of Virus and Seasonal Incidence 2 nurseries were studied continuously for 9 mo and another for 11 mo. Rotaviruses were regularly found in 
 These studies indicate that about half the newborn babies in the nurseries of five major metropolitan hospitals in Sydney were infected with rotaviruses before they were discharged. The great majority of these infections were asymptomatic and apparently quite transient in some babies. One surprising feature was the rapidity with which the neonates became infected after they entered the nursery. 3 out of 35 babies tested were found to be excreting virus one day after birth and 24 out of 65 (35%) two days after birth. From the third day, approximately 50% were excreting virus. The neonatal gut is colonised by lactobacilli and Escherichia coli within a few days of birth and it is not unreasonable to assume that rapid infection can take place with rotavir-uses. Mebus et al. have shown that bovine rotavirus will produce diarrhoea in newborn calves in 15 h after artificial inoculation. Excretion of viruses 24-48 h after birth by the human neonate is therefore not improbable.
 How the virus is acquired is not known but the few available facts strongly suggest environmental spread within the nursery. Adults seldom excrete rotaviruses and although a few cases of gastroenteritis and asymptomatic infection have been recorded7,8 it is unlikely that individual infection is acquired directly from mother or nurses.
 It is most likely that the virus enters the nursery through a visiting child or the rare adult excretor and then passes readily from neonate to neonate; the result is a persisting endemic infection as susceptible babies enter the nursery.
 We found no seasonal variation in the incidence of infection. About half the babies in the nursery seem to be consistently excreting virus throughout the year, unlike the infants and young children in whom the prevalence of the virus increases in the late winter and early spring.9
 Because of the high infection-rate among the newborn babies without symptoms, the role of rotaviruses as a cause of enteritis is not clear. Only 84 out of 304 babies (28%) excreting virus had diarrhoea. However, there were significantly more neonates with diarrhoea excreting virus than the symptom-free group (p<0.05) and in the absence of any other pathogen it seems that these viruses do in fact cause diarrhoea in some neonates. It was noted that viruses from some babies were coated with an antibody-like material; this feature may be an indication of the antibody level of the mother's milk or perhaps the non-antibody virus inhibitor recently described in human and cow's milk by Matthews et al.Io We did not find ""antibody"" coated viruses in cases of diarrhoea. The possible existence of rotavirus serotypes of differing pathogenicity could also explain the variable response to infection, but the determination of minor antigenic differences is not possible with the techniques available at present.",807479d4a1f69c19270b8ffa43b38a6c4634c9ea,1977-12-03,"Murphy, A.M.; Albrey, MaryB.; Crewe, EvelynB.",The Lancet,10.1016/s0140-6736(77)91538-0,The Lancet,700.0,True,"Pathogens shared with wild or domestic animals cause more than 60% of infectious diseases in man.

Other zoonotic pathogens can spread effi ciently between people once introduced from an animal reservoir, leading to localised outbreaks (eg, Ebola virus) or global spread (eg, pan demic infl uenza). Although under lying ecological principles that shape how these pathogens survive and change have remained similar, people have changed the environment in which these principles operate. 10] [11] [12] As human societies have developed, each era of livestock revolution pre sented new health challenges and new opportunities for emergence of zoonotic pathogens. SARS could have established, but was contained by rapid global response to its emergence; 14 other zoonoses, such as Ebola virus and Nipah virus, have not become established because of local control eff orts or their intrinsic inability to transmit effi ciently between people. 15 In all cases, these emerging zoonoses are defi ned by their relatively recent appearance (or detection) in a population or, in some cases, an amplifi cation of transmission that increases the incidence, prevalence, or geographical dis tribution of previously rare pathogens. 15 Emergence of a zoonosis depends on several factors that often act simultaneously to change pathogen dynamics. The capacity of a pathogen to transmit or spread in a population is commonly quantifi ed by the basic repro duction number, or R 0 (panel 1). If R 0 is greater than 1, the number of cases caused by a pathogen will increase and cause an epidemic. 24 Directly transmitted zoonoses can also have several reservoir hosts, potentially serving diff erent roles in pathogen dynamics, such as amplifi cation or transmission to human beings. The virus became established in domestic pig populations, amplifying viral trans mission and leading to a large outbreak in human beings in 1998-99. 26 More than 100 people died during this outbreak and more than 1 million pigs were killed to control the disease. Changes in abundance of animal hosts can strikingly aff ect disease incidence in people. 27 Environmental changes (including anthropogenic eff ects) might change the abundance of a wildlife reservoir host, increasing transmission within the reservoir and the risk of zoonotic transmission. However, the increased prevalence in rodents increased the risk of infection in people. 28 Ecological principles also apply at the scale of individuals. Processes of viral replication, immune clearance, and tissue tropism can be understood by analogy to ecological processes of reproduction, mortality, and dispersal between habitats. 39 The volume of consumption of wildlife products for food is at least an order of magnitude lower than it is for domestic livestock. For central African countries alone, estimates of annual wild meat consumption total 1 billion kg. Cultural and farming practices such as stocking rates, mixing of species, methods of confi nement, and feeding, and lack of proper implementation of disease-control methodsbecause of weak veterinary infrastructures and in suffi cient public-private partnerships to support and strengthen them-can serve to maintain or spread zoonotic diseases in livestock and provide a source of new infections in susceptible human populations (panel 2). 45, 46 The tech niques with which animals are slaughtered and processed, and how products are stored, packed, transported, and prepared at the place they are consumed, also enable foodborne disease outbreaks. 37 Cysticercosis (caused by the pig tapeworm Taenia solium) aff ects 50 million people every year. 6 Other notable foodborne parasites include trematodes (liver, lung, and intestinal fl ukes), which are a neglected disease group despite contributing to a sub stantial disease burden in southeast Asia and posing a serious impediment to public health and economic prosperity in the region. 44 The organism expanded its geographical range through various movement and marketing practices, contamination of inanimate objects and environments, and in some cases transmission back to migratory birds. However, the virus continues to circulate in avian populations. 4, 52 If sites are poorly managed, increased populations can strain existing infrastructure, leading to overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, improper disposal of waste, and a lack of potable water. However, assessments of the health eff ect that include principles of disease ecology are rarely done because standard operating procedures in develop ing countries and specifi c laws or regulations often do not require an assessment for health risks at a community level. 54 Furthermore, although some guidelines include zoonotic disease from domestic animals in their intended scope, few adequately address the range of potential zoonotic pathogens. 63, 64 The early antibiotics used in human medicine were all derived from natural bacterial and fungal sources. Resistance is emerging today on the same evolutionary principles. 71 Furthermore, the potential for reversal of resistance is unknown, as is whether it would occur in clinical settings after a change in antimicrobial use. 2, 5 Costs of zoonotic diseases are not restricted to expenses of human or animal treatment and control eff orts. 13, 40 Meeting the challenge will also require an under standing of how the environment is changing, and how these changes aff ect microbial dynamics across the system. Therefore, pre vention and
 Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria occur in many wild mammals and birds in numerous geographical locations. [ 61 Moreover, prevalence of vancomycin resistance in E coli between these two rodent species changes throughout the year. 61, 62 This fi nding suggests that, whatever the original sources of resistant bacteria and genes, diff erences in the ecology of wildlife species (eg, their diet and physiology) produce selection pressure on the microbes, rather than diff erential exposure to anthropogenic antimicrobials or presence of diff erent resistant strains in the environment. 75 Enhancing the role ecologists play in control programmes could include production of more accurate mathematical model outputs by collaboration with clinicians with real-time data, participation in both prospective and retrospective study design, and fi eld studies to identify key risk factors to target surveillance and interventions. These disease ecology approaches might be particularly useful in driving advances in prediction of the emergence and spread of novel zoonoses. All zoonoses have non-human reservoir hosts, and the dynamics of the pathogen in these hosts often determines the risk of outbreaks in people. Furthermore, emerging zoonotic disease studies are often considered as animal-focused or academic research (eg, studies to understand how dynamics of a pathogen in a wildlife host can change seasonally), when they are actually translational research eff orts essential to guide clinical or public health interventions (eg, seasonal variation in dynamics drives variation in risk to people). Eff ects of the use of antibiotics in animal production are not well understood, and the translation of this science could be enhanced by involvement of physicians, veterinarians, and ecologists in the design and interpretation of studies. These gaps aff ect disease prevention, surveillance, and control. Although the causes and risks of zoonoses vary widely from one region or culture to the next, our global connectivity demands the attention and alertness of health professionals everywhere.

We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital. Methods Patient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad. Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders. We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV.
 Findings Initial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea.
 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive. The two patients shared the same room for 3 days. The incubation period was estimated at 9-12 days for the second case. No secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specifi c protective measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was suspected. Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.
 Interpretation Patients with respiratory symptoms returning from the Middle East or exposed to a confi rmed case should be isolated and investigated for MERS-CoV with lower respiratory tract sample analysis and an assumed incubation period of 12 days. Immunosuppression should also be taken into account as a risk factor.","Coronaviruses are large enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses that can infect and cause disease in many animal species, including bats, mice, birds, dogs, pigs, and cattle. 1 In human beings, fi ve respiratory coronaviruses have been described, causing common cold (229E and OC43), upper respiratory tract infections (NL63), or pneumonia (HKU1 and SARS). 2 In September, 2012, a novel human coronavirus, named HCoV-EMC, was identifi ed in two patients with severe respiratory disease. 3, 4 This new coronavirus belongs to lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus, and is genetically closely related to coronaviruses from various bat species in Africa and Eurasia. 1, 5, 6 As of May 23, 2013, 44 laboratory-confi rmed cases had been diagnosed in several countries (France, Germany, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and the UK). 7, 8 Most patients with reported symptoms had severe respiratory disease, some with acute renal failure, and the case fatality rate is estimated at 50%. 9 All cases originated from, or had a history of travel to, the Middle East, except for two secondary cases in the UK, 4,10 two in Tunisia, 8 and one in France. 11 A large cluster (>20) of cases has been documented in a hospital in Saudi Arabia, and another is suspected on the basis of a retrospective analysis of samples kept after an outbreak of respiratory diseases in a Jordanian hospital in April, 2012. 12 On the basis of outbreak dynamics, HCoV-EMC was renamed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. 13 Whereas an as yet unidentifi ed animal reservoir might have caused the initial outbreaks by introducing the virus into the human population, the occurrence of clusters, whether in the community or in hospitals, is a worrying development, because it might result from adaptation of the virus to inter-human transmission. This process of adaptation might have been pivotal in the switch from aborted outbreaks to the international pandemic of SARS-CoV in 2003-04. 14 We report detailed clinical and virological information for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital in April, 2013.
 We report data for two patients who were admitted to hospital in April and May, 2013, in northern France. Their medical records were compiled and reviewed by their attending physicians. Spouses provided written informed consent for data and samples to be used for research and reporting purposes.
 We extracted RNA from specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and from whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens using the NucleoSpin Dx Virus or NucleoSpin RNA Blood Mini kits (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co KG, Düren, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For sputum, we applied a pretreatment with proteinase K (5 mg/mL for 10 min at 70°C) or Digest-EUR (Eurobio, Coutaboeuf, France) to reduce viscosity. We included sigma virus RNA (10 ng per assay) as a control for the extraction procedure and the absence of inhibitors.
 We tested extracted nucleic acids by real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the upE, Orf1a, or Orf1b regions of the MERS-CoV genome as previously described 15,16 on a LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system (Roche, Coutaboeuf, France). The quality of the specimens was assessed by real-time RT-PCR targeting the GAPDH house-keeping gene. Positive control for Orf1a and upE real-time RT-PCR was an in-vitro transcribed RNA, combining the sequences of the Orf1a gene (from nucleotide 11172 to nucleotide 11414) and the upE gene (from nucleotide 27357 to nucleo tide 27670) as the positive strand, designed based on the fi rst published sequence of MERS-CoV. 5 We did confi rmatory sequence analysis on the RdRp and N gene regions as described. 15 We assembled sequences using CLC Main WorkBench 6.8. 
 The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. As corresponding authors BG and SvdW had full access to all data in the study and had fi nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
 Patient 1, a 64-year-old man, visited Dubai from April 9, to April 17, 2013. Fever and chills with diarrhoea (three to four bowel movements per day) started on April 22. Symptoms were much the same as those of a previous episode of sigmoiditis treated 6 months before. He also had a history of hypertension and diabetes, and had undergone renal transplantation in 1998, for renal failure secondary to diabetes. His existing treatments were mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, and prednisone. He was admitted to the Valenciennes hospital on April 23, presenting with diarrhoea and fever reaching 39°C, arterial pressure at 137/66 mm Hg, and pulseoxymetric oxygen saturation of 96% on ambient air. At that time, he did not have any respiratory symptoms (cough or dyspnoea). Chest radiograph was normal (not shown). Table 1 summarises biological data for patient 1. Blood cultures, stool analysis, urine antigen assays for Legionella spp and Pneumococcus spp, and plasma PCR for cytomegalovirus were negative. Treatment with ceftriaxone was initiated on April 24.
 An abdominal CT scan done on April 24 did not show any evidence of colitis, but lower thoracic images showed major pulmonary infi ltrates (fi gure 1A). On April 26, the patient developed dyspnoea and cough. Levofl oxacin was added to ceftriaxone therapy. A CT scan of the lung was done on April 26, and showed a mostly peripheral interstitial infi ltrate associated with right lower-lobe consolidation and left lower-lobe consolidation in the anterior basal, lateral basal, and posterior basal areas. A bronchoalveolar lavage was done and cytology showed a high number of neutrophils and macrophages. No specifi c pathogen was identifi ed on direct microbiological examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid, and co-trimoxazole was added to the antimicrobial treatment regimen. Oxygen requirement increased daily to reach 10 L/min on April 29. Patient 1 was transferred to the Douai hospital intensive-care unit (ICU) on April 29, where non-invasive mechanical ventilation was started, and antimicrobial therapy was modifi ed to piperacilline plus tazobactam and linezolid. He had rapid respiratory deterioration, and was intubated on April 30 (fi gure 1B). Respiratory failure was followed by shock and renal failure, leading to noradrenaline administration and continuous venovenous haemofi ltration.
 On May 1, on the basis of the clinical presentation and the history of recent travel to Dubai, the hypothesis of an infection with MRES-CoV was raised, prompting the transfer of nasopharyngeal and stored bronchoalveolar lavage samples to the National Reference Center in Paris.
 Further worsening of the respiratory status with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) ratio of 100 despite low tidal volume and high-positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide, prone positioning, sedation, and neuromuscular blockade, prompted the implementation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Persisting haemodynamic support with norepinephrine at 0·5 mg/h was necessary. The patient was transferred to the ECMO referral centre ICU of Lille University Teaching Hospital on May 8 (fi gure 1C). As of May 27, the patient remained under ECMO therapy because of persisting severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (fi gure 1D). At 100% FiO 2 on both ECMO and ventilator settings and with mean ECMO pump fl ow of 5·2 L/min, resulting PaO 2 values did not exceed 80 mm Hg. Oxygen sweep fl ow was 12 L/min, resulting in mean partial pressure of carbon dioxide values of about 38 mm Hg. The patient had several haemorrhagic complications, contributing to renal failure and requirement for extrarenal epuration. No evidence of bacterial superinfection was noted before ECMO. Endotracheal aspirates remained sterile. After the implantation of ECMO, the patient had candidemia with Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Empirical antifungal therapy with caspofungin had been started before ECMO. Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.
 Patient 2, a 51-year-old man, was admitted to the Valenciennes hospital on April 26, for left arm deep venous thrombosis. He lived in the north of France and had not recently travelled abroad. His medical history included myocardial infarction in 2005, arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and histamine-induced angioedema, for which he had needed systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone 40 mg per day) since June, 2012. He also had several episodes of deep venous thrombosis associated with the presence of low concentrations of an anticardiolipin antibody, IgM isotype, for which he was treated with a vitamin K antagonist. Patient 2 shared patient 1's room from April 26, to April 29. The room was 20 m², and 1·5 m separated the two patients' beds. Both patients shared the same bathroom. During this 3-day period, patient 1 remained mostly confi ned to his bed, whereas patient 2 was able to move around. No nebulisers or known aerosol-generating procedures were used for patient 1. Because the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was not suspected, patient 1 wore no mask, and neither patient 2, nor staff nor visitors used protective equipment. Patient 2 was discharged from the hospital to his home on April 30. On May 8, patient 2 presented with asthenia, myalgia, and cough. On May 9, he was rapidly directed to the Infectious Diseases Department of Lille University Teaching Hospital, since by that time he was a known contact of a confi rmed case (positive results for MERS-CoV were available for patient 1 on May 7). On admission, he presented with fever (38°C), pulseoxymetric saturation of 95% on ambient air, and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per min. Table 2 summarises biological data for patient 2. Chest radiograph showed upper right lobe consolidation (fi gure 2A). Oxygen therapy at 3 L/min and piperacillin plus tazobactam were started on April 30. The initial nasopharyngeal sample was inconclusive. The patient remained stable but with a high fever (39-40°C) between May 9 and May 12. Linezolid was added to the anti microbial regimen on May 11. Diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was confi rmed on the basis of results from induced sputum analysis on May 11. Personal protective equipmentan FFP2 mask, gloves, gown, and goggles-was used to prevent secondary transmission during sputum induction.
 On May 12, the patient had acute respiratory failure, and oxygen therapy was increased to 5 L/min. Chest radiograph showed complete consolidation of the right lung and involvement of the lower left lobe (fi gure 2B).
 The patient was transferred to the ICU where oxygen therapy was progressively increased. Appearance of confusion, disorientation, and increasing hypoxaemia led to intubation and mechanical ventilation on May 13. Bronchoalveolar lavage was done, and no specifi c pathogen was identifi ed, either on direct microbiological examination or culture. This sample was not tested for MERS-CoV, because the diagnosis had already been confi rmed. After intubation, on the same day, FiO 2 was increased to 1; inhaled nitric oxide and prone positioning became necessary. After intubation, dobutamine was introduced for biventricular dysfunction-confi rmed by transthoracic echo cardio gram-and progressively weaned over the next 48 h. Acute renal failure and anuria, despite volume expansion, resulted in haemodialysis on May 14. On May 14, PaO 2 to FiO 2 ratio was 90, despite inhaled nitric oxide, prone positioning, and low tidal volume and high PEEP ventilation, leading to imple mentation of ECMO. Neither norepinephrine nor dobuta mine treatment were underway on the day of ECMO implantation. Chest radiograph showed bilateral diff use alveolar-interstitial infi ltrates on May 15 (fi gure 2C). The chest radiograph also showed bilateral ground-glass opacities with major consolidation (fi gure 2D). No bacterial superinfection was identifi ed before ECMO. Patient 2's respiratory status has improved since May 26, with FiO 2 at 70% on both ventilator and ECMO settings, ECMO fl ow at 5·2 L/min, and ECMO oxygen sweep fl ow at 5 L/min. Sedation is being progressively weaned.
 On May 2, the National Infl uenza Center at the Institut Pasteur was notifi ed by the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance of a possible case of infection with MERS-CoV. A nasopharyngeal swab obtained from patient 1 on April 30, analysed by real-time RT-PCR, was Preliminary results of RT-PCR done on blood specimens from patient 1 on May 9 were positive for MERS-CoV in whole blood; weak but inconsistent detection was noted in plasma samples (table 3) . No other types of specimens were analysed for either patient in this timeframe.
 Virus isolation on Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney) cells was attempted from all respiratory specimens from both patients and an isolate was obtained from the sputum of patient 1. Preliminary analysis of serum samples from patient 1 from May 7 and May 9 shows reactivity in western blot with a recombinant N protein (data not shown).
 Confi rmatory sequence analysis of the RdRp and N gene segments was done directly on RNA extracted from the bronchoalveolar lavage specimen from patient 1 and sputum specimen from patient 2. The sequences from both patients were identical. The RdRp sequences showed the C→T polymorphism at position 15196, which distinguishes all available sequences from that of the EMC/2012 isolate. 5 For the N gene, sequences were identical to that of the EMC isolate and did not show the short deletion (nucleotides 29736-29741) nor any of the polymorphisms recorded at positions 29714 (A→T) and 29723 (G→T) in the England/Qatar/2012 sequence, nor that found at position 29811 (C→T) in the Jordan-N3/2012 sequence (appendix). 5, 15, 17 These results defi nitively estab lish that both patients were infected with MERS-CoV.
 This report describes the fi rst two French cases of MERS-CoV infection with a case of patient-to-patient nosocomial transmission (panel). Our fi ndings suggest that the virus's incubation period could reach 9-12 days, a longer period than what was previously recorded, with clinical implications for the duration of quarantine. Our results also suggest that the best samples to detect the virus are those from the lower respiratory tract, rather than nasopharyngeal samples.
 The two cases we report show very similar clinical features compared with the only two other cases for which detailed clinical descriptions are available; 3,4 other reports do not have complete clinical data. Initial presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia. Respiratory symptoms with cough and dyspnoea soon became the predominant clinical symptoms, with a rapid deterioration of oxygenation and increasing oxygen requirements, leading to mechanical ventilation and ECMO. Later in the course of disease, and soon after ICU admission, severe renal failure with anuria needing renal replacement therapy developed. Lympho penia was another common feature in our two patients, also noted in the report by Zaki and colleagues. 3 Such a clinical presentation is reminiscent of that of patients with severe SARS, except that acute renal failure seemed less common in SARS cases. In fact, SARS-CoV was associated with a wide spectrum of clinical features-infected people presented initially with fever, myalgia, chills, and rigor and subsequently developed pneu monia. 14,18 Notably, patient 1 had diarrhoea among initial symptoms, a feature not yet reported in patients with MERS-CoV, but present upon admission in a quarter of patients with SARS. 19 Patient 1 died on May 28, and patient 2 remains in the ICU under ECMO. The casefatality rate in patients infected with MERS-CoV is highit is estimated to be 50% in the 44 patients reported so far by WHO. 8 This rate is higher than that of SARS, estimated at 15%, and strongly age-dependant. 14 Whether this rate is higher for patients with MERS-CoV because of See Online for appendix
 We searched PubMed on May 25, 2013, with the terms ""HCoV-EMC"" and ""MERS-CoV"" for articles published in English. Our search identifi ed 24 reports linked to HCoV-EMC, starting with the initial report from Zaki and colleagues 3 describing a previously unknown coronavirus isolated from the sputum of a 60-year-old man. Articles relevant to our paper are cited in the text. The search with ""MERS-CoV"" identifi ed four articles, none of which were related to human transmission or clinical fi ndings.
 Our report provides evidence that patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of travel to the Middle East or contact with a known MERS-CoV case in the past 12 days should be isolated and investigated using lower respiratory tract samples. Our fi ndings also suggest that immunosuppression is an aggravating factor, and could be associated with atypical clinical presentation.
 underreporting of milder forms of disease, a higher proportion of patients with underlying immuno suppressive disorders, as in our patients, or higher virulence of MERS-CoV compared with SARS-CoV has yet to be established.
 For the two patients described here, MERS-CoV was detected at the time of the diagnosis of pneumonia. The data we have obtained so far show identical sequences for the viruses infecting both patients, and this sequence is also identical to most of the available reported MERS-CoV sequences. Whole genome sequencing and analysis of viral population diversities will be needed to further establish the degree of variability of the viruses of the French cases relative to previous cases and to work out the relatedness of the viruses of the two patients upon transmission.
 Viral load was high in samples obtained from the lower respiratory tract, whereas the virus was almost undetectable in upper respiratory tract samples. Besides our two cases, available data for confi rmed patients have shown positive detection by RT-PCR in upper respiratory tract specimens on days 4, 12, 13, and 14 4,10,20 after symptom onset, and in lower respiratory tract specimens on days 8, 17, and 19 4,20 after symptom onset. A sputum sample taken 7 days after symptom onset has also been reported as having led to virus isolation. 3 Notably, for patient 2, as for the London case reported in September, 2012, nasal and throat swabs were negative at the time at which sputum samples were positive. 4 The little information available for virus shedding up to now is reminiscent of SARS-CoV, for which overall the virus was detected by RT-PCR in 76% of lower respiratory tract clinical samples, versus 37% of upper respiratory tract samples, 21 and viral load was signifi cantly higher in the lower respiratory tract compared with the upper respiratory tract. In the upper respiratory tract, the rate of viral shedding was initially low and increased to peak at around day 15. 22 Whether MERS-CoV is present outside the respiratory tract will require additional studies. So far, there have been no reports of virus detection in stool or urine, and our preliminary data suggest that the virus might be present in blood. For SARS, the virus was readily detected in stool samples and more frequently after 10 days from onset of symptoms, whereas in blood samples detection was more frequent during the early course of illness. 21 Although additional data for the kinetics and routes of viral shedding are needed for MERS-CoV, initial data suggest that for possible or suspect cases, especially when presenting early after the onset of symptoms, clinical samples from the lower respiratory tract should be obtained for confi rmation of infection. Confi rmation of an initially negative result on another sample taken a few days later should be recommended before exclusion of possible cases.
 Patient 2 was admitted on April 26, at a time when pneumonia was already present in patient 1 and MERS-CoV was present in the bronchoalveolar lavage sample taken on the same day (although this result was not available at the time). For the next 3 days, the two patients shared the same room with no specifi c isolation measures other than standard precautions. 9-12 days after this exposure, patient 2 developed symptoms suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection (fi gure 3). In patient 2, infection with MERS-CoV was confi rmed 2 days later on an induced sputum sample. This timeframe is at the high end of the 1-9 day incubation period reported in the two secondary cases from the UK 10 and of the 2-10 day incubation period of SARS. 23 In view of the very small number of patients for whom a well-defi ned window of exposure for MERS-CoV is available, this fi nding of human-to-human transmission through exposure during the upper range of reported incubation periods suggests that incubation periods beyond 10 days might be possible with MERS-CoV, with important implications for the duration of the quarantine needed to rule out infection in contacts. Furthermore, patient 2 had not recently travelled abroad, excluding any other source of contamination. However, the exact route of transmission from patient 1 to patient 2 remains unclear. Nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV has been suspected in patients and health-care workers with respiratory symptoms in Jordan in April, 2012, and in an ongoing hospital outbreak with more than 20 cases in Saudi Arabia. 24 Person-to-person transmission was further documented from one patient to two family members in the UK 10 and for two cases reported in Tunisia. 8 As for SARS-CoV, transmission through large respiratory droplets is currently thought to be the most likely route of MERS-CoV transmission between the two patients we describe. No aerosol-generating procedures were used with patient 1. The presence of diarrhoea in 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 patient 1, possibly linked to MERS-CoV infection as previously described with SARS-CoV, 25 might also have been a potential source of contamination of the environment. Systematic detection of MERS-CoV in stools of future patients might be important to document shedding of the virus through faeces and its potential contribution to viral transmission. During the hospital stay in Valenciennes, no personal protective equipment was used, and we did not record any secondary trans mission in more than 100 health-care workers assessed for the development of symptoms or tested by RT-PCR for the presence of MERS-CoV (unpublished). Similarly, patient 2 was discharged from the hospital to his home and, up to now, no secondary cases have been detected in some 40 contacts. Low virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract might contribute to reduced transmis sibility, although serological investigations will be needed to better assess the extent of transmission. The under lying disorder and immuno suppressive treatment of the two patients probably contributed to their increased susceptibility to the infection, and such background should be added to the list of criteria associated with increased suspicion of MERS-CoV infection. The risk that on acquisition of mutations MERS-CoV might become increasingly transmissible between human beings must also be kept in mind and continuously assessed as suggested. 26 Contributors BG, AF, and SvdW jointly wrote the report.

All laboratory procedures for respiratory secretions have been previously reported. RT-PCR was used to subtype for H1, H3, H5, H9, and H7. RNA extraction, complementary DNA syn thesis, and PCR sequencing were done for one human and one chicken isolate. We used the MEGA software package v5.05 (Center for Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics, Biodesign Institute, AZ, USA) to construct the phylogenetic trees of H, N, PB2, and NS genes on the basis of the neighbour-joining method, with Tamura-Nei model of nucleotide substitution.

The four patients were clustered within Zhejiang, China, within a few weeks (when migratory birds were moving north and transiting at the Yangtze River Delta). 1 They presented with high fevers, lower-respiratory-tract symptoms (especially dyspnoea), and radiological features of con solidation and ground glass changes. 1 Respiratory failure progressed within 3-14 days and death 1-3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Furthermore, H9N2 and H5N1 viruses both induced prominent cytokine and chemokine activation in human macrophages and epithelial cells compared with that induced by seasonal infl uenza A H1N1 virus. 21 Immunomodulatory agents such as celecoxib (but not corticosteroids) improve outcomes of H5N1 infections in mice. 1 α-2,3linked sialic acid was detected on non-ciliated cuboidal bronchiolar cells at the junction between the respiratory bronchiole and alveolus. Further adaptive genetic changes of such viruses in domestic poultry can enable transmission to people. The key concerns about the current outbreak of infl uenza A H7N9 virus are how the virus crosses the species barrier and whether it will further adapt to en able effi cient person-to-person transmission. 23 In 2003, an H7N7 virus, which contained the multibasic aminoacid motif associated with virulence and the genetic marker for mammalian adaptation (Glu627Lys) caused one fatal infection in the Netherlands. Aggressive intervention to block further animal-to-person transmission in live poultry markets, as has previously been done in Hong Kong, should be considered. WL, SY, HG, JS, QF, YL, XY, YuZ, and SX had roles in recruitment, data collection, and clinical management.

Many vector-borne pathogens have appeared in new regions in the past two decades, and many endemic diseases have increased in incidence. Although introductions and local emergence are frequently considered distinct processes, many emerging endemic pathogens are in fact invading at a local scale coincident with habitat change. We highlight key differences in the dynamics and disease burden that result from increased pathogen transmission following habitat change compared with the introduction of pathogens to new regions. Truly in situ emergence is commonly driven by changes in human factors as much as by enhanced enzootic cycles whereas pathogen invasion results from anthropogenic trade and travel and suitable conditions for a pathogen, including hosts, vectors, and climate. Once established, ecological factors related to vector characteristics shape the evolutionary selective pressure on pathogens that may result in increased use of humans as transmission hosts. We describe challenges inherent in the control of vector-borne zoonotic diseases and some emerging non-traditional strategies that may be more effective in the long term.","Over the past three decades vector-borne pathogens (VBPs) have been on the move, creating new challenges for public health (Fig. 1 ). 1 Some are exotic pathogens that have been introduced into new regions, and others are endemic species that have shown large increases in incidence or have started to infect local human populations for the first time. Here we review the drivers of these processes. Of particular interest are zoonoses that are maintained by transmission in wildlife but also infect humans bitten by vectors. We also draw from lessons learned from diseases that now use only humans as transmission hosts such as malaria and dengue.
 Clinicians have a vital role to play, alongside disease ecologists and epidemiologists, in studying the causes of an outbreak and minimizing the burden of disease because the efficacy of control is improved by rapid identification. 2, 3 In many cases, clinicians are on the first line of detection of these epidemics as clusters of patients present with novel sets of symptoms and this evidence of new outbreaks must be passed to public health agencies for appropriate management. New high-throughput technologies for detection and identification of novel genetic material in samples taken from patients can significantly aid this process. 4, 5 In addition, data obtained via mobile phones and online social networks, checked against expert assessment of plausibility, offers the potential for detecting changes in spatial and temporal patterns of illness in real time such that new epidemics may be detected early. 6 West Nile virus (WNV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are among the best-understood zoonotic VBPs to have emerged in the last two decades and show just how explosive epidemics can be in new regions (Fig. 1) . In 1999, the New York City Department of Health reported a cluster of patients with meningoencephalitis associated with muscle weakness and epidemiological evidence suggested that an arbovirus was a likely cause. 7 Clinicians and veterinarians collaborated to identify the aetiological agent as WNV, but identification and initial control efforts, unfortunately, did not prevent the virus spreading from the east to the west coast of North America within four years, and causing significant national epidemics in 2002 . Similarly, in 2005 in the Indian Ocean island of La Réunion there was an epidemic of hundreds of patients with a painful and disabling polyarthralgia, and a subset presented with neurological signs or fulminant hepatitis. 8 The second wave of the epidemic in 2006 exceeded all expectations, eventually infecting over a third of the entire population of 770,000 people. The causative agent was identified as CHIKV, which is also causing ongoing epidemics in India with several million cases to date. [8] [9] [10] Other introductions of VBPs have caused smaller outbreaks but have been significant in expanding the range of human populations at risk, including dengue virus to Hawaii, 11 Zika virus (ZIKV) to the Micronesian island of Yap, 12 and CHIKV to Europe. 13 In the case of CHIKV it is not clear whether the outbreak died out naturally due to the arrival of the temperate autumn or was interrupted by mosquito control efforts.
 These past experiences, together with increases in the known drivers of pathogen introduction that we describe below, suggest that future introductions are likely. Zoonotic VBPs that are likely to be introduced into new regions include Rift Valley Fever and Japanese Encephalitis viruses (JEV) in the Americas, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus in Eurasia or Africa, Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever virus (CCHFV) in new parts of Eurasia, and others (Table 1) . 1 A key challenge arises from the non-specificity and similarity of symptoms caused by many of these viruses, especially ZIKV, dengue and CHIKV that all present with acute fever similar to many diseases endemic in the tropics such as malaria. 12, 14 This makes rapid identification tools 15 and high quality laboratory-based diagnoses necessary for accurate surveillance and appropriate therapy. Recent advances in identifying unknown pathogens using deep sequencing and microarrays should enable more rapid identification of novel or introduced pathogens. 16 A key need is to develop diagnostics for point-of-care use for both infection and exposure, to allow for proper assessments of case fatality ratios and disease burden.
 The emergence of endemic VBPs is usually thought to be a qualitatively different process from the arrival of exotic VBPs, but in some cases increases in incidence result more from spread into new areas than increases in local transmission. A combination of local spread and an increase in transmission potential in situ is also possible, and Lyme disease is perhaps the best understood example of a mixed emergence. Reported cases (and estimated illnesses) have approximately tripled since 1990 in North America (Fig. 1) , appeared increasingly in Canada, 17 and apparently increased 2-to 10-fold in various parts of Europe where diagnosis and reporting are less certain. Evidence for the importance of local invasion comes from the states of Wisconsin and Virginia where Lyme cases have appeared recently in counties where few if any cases occurred previously, while in the state of Connecticut, where the first cases of Lyme were detected 3 decades ago, there is little upward trend in incidence in the last decade (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/index.html). In contrast, in Europe and Eurasia, the significant rise in cases of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases, including babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, and rickettsiasis, and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), is due as much or more to upsurges within pre-existing ranges of the vector ticks, principally Ixodes ricinus and I. persulcatus as to the establishment of enzootic cycles in new places. Zoonotic VBPs with other types of vectors that also represent an important and growing threat in some places include those that cause Chagas disease, plague, and leishmaniasis. 18 Strong evidence suggests that ecological and human factors have played significant roles in determining the differential patterns of increased incidence of all these diseases, while increasing awareness and testing by clinicians has contributed to better reporting of cases.
 Differences in the drivers of emergence of exotic and endemic VBPs have important implications for their subsequent dynamics, where they are likely to emerge, and the efforts that can be made to control or eliminate them. We consider each of these aspects in turn, illustrated by some of the more notable examples across the globe (Fig. 1) . We argue that viewing emerging endemic pathogens as invading pathogens at a local scale can be used to take a prospective approach to prevention and control.
 The main driver of recent pathogen introductions, the accelerating increase in trade and travel over the past five decades, is well known. What is less discussed is that four centuries of trade and travel set the stage for many current pathogen introductions. In the 17 th to 19 th centuries shipping traffic resulted in the introduction of several important mosquito species by transporting larvae alongside traded goods, including Aedes aegypti (a vector of dengue, yellow fever, CHIKV and others), Culex pipiens (a vector of WNV) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (a vector of WNV, and filiariasis). [19] [20] [21] Some pathogens, such as Plasmodium vivax malaria, were introduced to new continents and became established coincident with or shortly after these early vector introductions because they cause chronic infections of humans such that humans were still infectious after weeks or months of travel. 22 Other pathogens that have only short periods of infectiousness in humans, including yellow fever virus and some dengue virus strains, were also able to reach distant regions centuries ago because pathogen transmission cycles often occur aboard ships where vectors are present and can reproduce. 21 The recent growth in air travel enabling global transit in a single day (Fig. 2 ) has accelerated pathogen introductions because it has allowed many more pathogens that cause acute infectiousness, including many subtypes of dengue virus, CHIKV, and WNV, to reach other continents within the few days that hosts are infectious, and even during the latent period for some diseases. 23 Several of these pathogens were also aided by the 20 th century introductions of another key vector, Ae. albopictus. 24, 25 Thus, the most recent wave of pathogen introductions, and those likely to occur in the near future, take place against the backdrop of centuries of vector introductions that facilitate establishment.
 A key consequence of having an already well established vector population and a highly suitable environment (including hosts and climate) is that many introduced pathogens cause explosive epidemics in which a very large fraction of the population at risk is infected in the first few years after introduction ( Fig. 1 ). High vector populations (relative to host abundance) result in a high basic reproductive ratio or R 0 of the pathogen, and if the population is immunologically naïve to the introduced pathogen, as is usually the case, then the effective pathogen reproductive ratio, R eff , is close to the maximum, R 0 . This leads to another common pattern, which is that the intense and rapid initial spread of a novel pathogen is frequently followed by a substantial decrease in case burden shortly after introduction, especially on a local scale. 26 This both contrasts with, and has similarities to, the emergence of endemic diseases.
 The emergence of endemic VBPs is frequently associated with changes in land use 27 or socio-economic conditions, and this determines the dynamics of disease emergence. For endemic pathogens driven by land use change, the rise in case numbers frequently shows a gradual increase ( Fig. 1) paralleling changes in the pathogen's abiotic and biotic environment. In contrast, the rate of increase in incidence for endemic disease emergence driven by changes in socio-economic conditions can be much more abrupt if the rate of change in socio-economic conditions is rapid, such as that caused by political upheavals, military conflicts or natural disasters.
 Changes in land use influence VBPs by altering the interactions and abundance of wildlife and domestic hosts, vectors, and humans with some overall impacts being clearer than others. 27 In the Amazon and East Africa, increased standing water and sunlight as a result of deforestation enhance the breeding success of some mosquito species, which may increase the risk of malaria, whereas further increases in urbanization frequently eliminate Anopheline mosquito habitat and have reduced malaria elsewhere. 28 In northeastern North America reforestation during the 20 th century is thought to have permitted re-colonization by deer and the consequent expansion of the range of ticks (Ixodes scapularis), underpinning the emergence of Lyme disease in the mid-20 th century. 29 Deer (Odocoileus virginianus in the USA, and Capreolus capreolus in Europe) serve a key role in feeding adult Ixodes ticks, although they are actually incompetent hosts for the Lyme disease bacterial spirochetes. In addition, more recent fragmentation of forests in eastern North America and changes in predator communities 30 has altered the host community for ticks and the Lyme bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi and may have resulted in greater relative abundance of small mammals (white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, and shrews, Sorex spp. and Blarina brevicauda) that are the principal transmission hosts for Lyme disease spirochetes. These changes in the host community may result in a higher spirochete infection prevalence in nymphal ticks. 31 A key remaining question is to determine how fragmentation and hunting-induced changes to the host community affect the abundance of infected nymphal ticks, which is the key metric for disease risk.
 Changes in land use may also be responsible for recent emergent foci of CCHF within its extensive range through parts of Africa, Asia, southeastern Europe and the Middle East. In contrast to typical sporadic outbreaks consisting of only a few cases, an exceptional epidemic occurred in Turkey, starting with about 20 cases in 2002 and rising to nearly 1400 cases by 2008 (Fig. 1) . The majority of infections occurred amongst agricultural and animal husbandry workers via tick bites and direct contamination from infected animals. It has been hypothesized that changes in land cover associated with political unrest and reduced agricultural activities permitted colonization by wildlife with consequent tick population growth, as is thought to have precipitated the first recorded CCHF epidemic in Crimea in 1944-45. 32 Interestingly, the case fatality rate (5%) in Turkey has been much lower than is usually observed (30-50%), creating some uncertainty as to the cause of this epidemic. This uncertainty highlights the need for accurate and systematic diagnosis through effective point-of-care diagnostic tools.
 Increases in incidence can also result from changes in socio-economic and human activities, such as expansion into risky new habitats for exploitation or dwelling, or land cover change such as reforestation of previously agricultural areas. 29, [33] [34] [35] Human infection with VBPs increases with the product of entomological risk (the abundance of infected vectors) and exposure of humans to vectors, which can change independently, and sometimes synergistically. Exposure to ticks, paradoxically, may be higher in wealthy and poor people than those with intermediate financial standing (Fig. 3) . Incidence of Lyme disease in parts of Europe has been shown to be higher amongst wealthy people living in new homes within broad-leaf woodlands where wildlife, including rodents and birds that serve as reservoirs for spirochetes, and ticks co-occur. 36 More generally, greater outdoor recreational opportunities associated with increased wealth can result in increased exposure to vectors. Conversely, hardship precipitated by population displacements due to civil conflict, loss of protective housing through natural disasters, or greater use of the natural environmental resources driven by economic transitions can lead to greater contact between humans and vectors. 37, 38 A clear example comes from a significant upsurge of TBE in 2009 immediately following the economic downturn in three eastern European countries already suffering high levels of background poverty and where foods are harvested from forests for subsistence and commerce. 39 Human activities resulting in exposure to VBPs is sometimes reflected in different seasonal patterns, such as cases of TBE in different parts of Europe (Fig. 4) . In eastern Europe, the relatively later timing of cases matches the season of forest food harvest more closely than the seasonal pattern of tick abundance, while in western Europe, the earlier peak of cases coincides with the peak in summer recreational activity. More simply, the incidence of dengue, for example, is higher on the poorer Mexican side of the Mexico-Texas border, 40 where open windows compensate for the absence of air-conditioning but expose people to high mosquito biting.
 The effects of poverty and wealth, however, are likely to be asymmetrical in determining final disease outcomes (Fig. 3 ) because economic duress limits the potential for ameliorative actions (e.g., limiting outdoor activities, protection from vector bites, or costly vaccination in the case of TBE, etc). This hypothesis may partly explain the difference between a marked upsurge (2-to 30-fold) in reported TBE cases in the early 1990s in central and eastern Europe after the fall of Soviet rule and a more gradual and steady increase in western Europe (Fig. 1) . 38 Political and civil unrest that commonly occur with armed conflict may also account for the sudden re-emergence of plague in Vietnam in the late 1960s and in Madagascar and Mozambique at the end of the 1980s. 41 Understanding the mechanistic processes linking land use and socio-economic conditions to disease facilitates prediction of future trends and control or mitigation. Economic aid could be targeted towards populations at high disease risk from recent social strife caused by conflict or natural disasters, and urban planning could be used to minimize the overlap and use of risky habitat by humans. Unfortunately, in many cases, while correlations exist between land use and disease incidence or some measure of risk, rigorous and mechanistic analyses linking increases in incidence to land use needed for intelligent urban planning are lacking. For example, in North America certain types of land use (agriculture and urbanization) are linked with higher WNV incidence in humans at the county scale, but the mechanism underlying this pattern is unknown. 26, 42 This gap in our knowledge makes it difficult to anticipate and avoid future epidemics associated with rapid urbanization and land use change.
 Although several components of vector-borne disease systems (the vector and the pathogen) are highly sensitive to climate, evidence shows that climate change has been less important in the recent emergence of vector-borne diseases than changes in land use, human living conditions, and societal factors, likely to be a result of countering influences (Box 1). An exception to this appears to be the increased transmission of VBPs with warming along the cold latitudinal and altitudinal edges of their current distribution. The differential influence of climate at the edge and core of a pathogen's distribution stems in part from the nonlinear relationship between the fraction of the human population exposed and transmission intensity; the latter can be quantified as R 0 , the pathogen reproductive ratio. Specifically, initial increases in R 0 above the critical value of 1 for an epidemic (i.e. allowing pathogen spread) lead to large increases in case burden, but beyond that, increases in R 0 have diminishing impacts, especially for pathogens with sterilizing immunity. It should be noted that expansions in the distribution of a disease may have disproportionate impacts on public health if newly exposed populations there have little immunity. Examples of VBP range expansions at cooler edges include dengue virus in Texas, 43 Lyme disease in Canada, 17 and TBE at increasing altitude in Slovakia. 44
 Although it is now well established in the scientific community that climate change has played and will play a mixed and relatively minor role in the emergence of most VBPs and diseases in general, 68, 69 there is nonetheless a persistent stream of review articles that claim that climate change is a significant driving force for the emergence of VBPs. These reviews stem from two semi-independent assumptions that have grown up over the past decade: a) that climate change will lead to more widespread and more abundant VBPs as more of the planet more closely resembles the tropics where VBPs are currently most abundant; b) that the observed recent arrival of exotic, and upsurges of endemic, VBPs are due to climate changes to date. Both of these assumptions originate in plausible general biological arguments, as the natural distribution and intensity of VBPs are indeed highly sensitive to climate. 77 They were partly inspired by repeated publications of highly influential and visually arresting maps at the end of the 20 th century that presented predictions from mathematical models that were not parameterized with data for key variables (e.g. vector abundance). 70 Belief is bolstered by speculative papers that describe the general coincidence of increased disease incidence with warming over recent decades. 71, 72 Spatio-temporal analyses of variation around long-trends suggests that in many cases climate has not consistently changed in the right way, at the right time and in the right places to account for the observed epidemiology of emergent VBPs. 73 The effects of climate on transmission are multiple, non-linear, and act in opposing directions. Thus, predicting the overall impact of climate and climate change on vectorborne disease systems requires a complete understanding and parameterization of VBP models. 74, 75 Specifically, higher temperatures increase three aspects of transmission for vector-borne pathogens, vector biting rate, vector development rate, pathogen replication (thereby reducing the extrinsic incubation period or the time between a vector feeding on an infected host and being able to transmit the pathogen), but frequently decrease a fourth, vector survival, especially when associated with moisture stress. As a result, increased temperatures may lead to increases or decreases in transmission depending on the relative impacts of these factors. 77 A key challenge is that biological models frequently have difficulty accurately predicting changes in vector abundance, the most variable factor in the transmission potential of VBPs.
 The best science clearly indicates that climate change impacts on VBPs will be variable, as one would expect from all such complex systems. 76 Thus, while continuing climate change may increase transmission or distributions of some VBPs in the future, other factors will frequently play a more significant role and, importantly, be more tractable to public health initiatives. These include changes in the biotic elements of the environment (e.g. wildlife hosts), drug resistance, reduced health service provision, and political and socio-economic factors that change human exposure and susceptibility to infections.
 Governments and public health agencies want predictions of the disease burden and risk in the future. To do so, we must develop a more robust understanding of how all aspects of climate influence the rates of the processes involved in transmission, 74 and also expand the breadth of analyses to include all the potential factors influencing incidence of infection and prevalence of disease, both biological and non-biological. Predictions will require truly cross-disciplinary collaborations, marrying biologists' pursuit of better models of vector abundance, infection prevalence and pathogen evolution (e.g. drug resistance) with understanding from medical and social scientists about developments in treatment and interventions, land use change, and human societal factors. Doing so would move our knowledge from its current state, based on assumptions about what global warming will do, to a more evidence-based set of predictions.
 In core transmission areas, not only are the effects of climate change minor compared with other factors, but warming may even decrease transmission if decreases in vector survival through heat and moisture stress overwhelm other influences. 45 A recent analysis of several decades of severe malaria incidence (the most well studied disease with respect to climate change) at five locations spanning a range of elevations in western Kenya revealed initial increases in incidence followed by two decades of declines at two locations and increases with higher variability in three others. 46 These mixed patterns challenge simple expectations that ongoing climate change will lead to increased malaria and suggest that changes in malaria and other VBP transmission potential are driven instead by a mix of factors including demographic shifts, land use change, interventions (e.g., bed nets), drug resistance, and climate. The relative contributions of each factor can only be rigorously assessed by careful comparisons of the same pathogen over time and with valid accurate baseline data, in contrast to a recent study. 47 There are likely to be many more emerging zoonotic VBPs in the near future and it is critical that assessment of the causes of emergence focus more on changing land use and socioeconomic factors and public health measures (e.g. drug treatment, vaccines, bed nets) that determine human exposure than on climate driven changes in enzootic potential.
 One under-appreciated aspect of increased human populations, global land use change, and the introduction of human commensal vectors is the selective pressure exerted on pathogens, causing them to evolve to take advantage of the new environments, including hosts and vectors. Both WNV and CHIKV evolved rapidly (a feature typical of viruses and especially of RNA viruses 48 ) after being introduced to new locations and encountering new anthropophilic vectors. Specifically, the originally introduced genotype of WNV (NY99) was replaced by another genotype (WN02) 49 that differs by three consensus nucleotide changes and exhibits increased transmission efficiency in Culex pipiens and Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes. 50, 51 Similarly, on La Réunion a single nucleotide change occurred in CHIKV between 2005 and 2006 that increased infection in the recently introduced mosquito species, Ae. albopictus. 52 The same genetic change appeared independently in viruses isolated from La Réunion, West Africa and Italy, but was not identified in mosquitoes from India in 2006 at the start of the ongoing epidemics there. 53 When Ae. albopictus rather than Ae. aegypti became the main vector in India from 2007, however, the same genetic substitution spread rapidly and subsequent substitutions appear to be facilitating even more efficient virus circulation and persistence, which may presage further expansion of CHIKV ranges. 52 More generally, the transmission of many VBPs is relatively inefficient when the vector feeds on a range of hosts, only some of which are infectious for the pathogen. 54 It is no coincidence that the dominant human VBPs, malaria and dengue, are transmitted most intensely where they are vectored by mosquitoes that feed almost entirely on humans. What has been less appreciated is the selective pressure currently imposed on zoonotic pathogens (i.e. those for which humans are still a dead end host) to adapt to being transmitted efficiently amongst abundant humans by human specialist vectors like Anopheles gambiae, Ae. aegypti and, to slightly lesser extent, Ae. albopictus, which sometimes feeds on nonhuman mammals and birds. As the abundance of human commensal vectors increases with urbanization and deforestation, the opportunities for strictly human transmission of pathogens increase.
 Novel introductions and increases in incidence of endemic VBPs (Fig. 1 ) highlight the need for effective control and treatment of individuals suffering from associated diseases. A key challenge in attempting to control many VBPs is that they are zoonotic and transmission intensity is driven primarily by wildlife reservoirs. As a result, the dominant tool used against directly transmitted pathogens, vaccines, only protects those with financial and logistical access to the vaccine, and has no impact on underlying transmission intensity. Thus, there is no protective effect of natural or vaccine acquired ""herd immunity"" in humans, and exposure of people is governed primarily by their contact with vectors.
 Managing or treating zoonoses of wildlife is difficult at best, and eradication is nearly impossible. 34 Vaccines for wildlife hosts, in development for WNV, 55 and field tested at a small scale for Lyme borreliosis, 56 offer some reason for optimism, but substantial work remains before they can be deployed as an effective tool on a large scale. In addition, for insect-borne pathogens, transmission is thought to be frequency-dependent, such that livestock or wildlife culling that decreases host abundance (short of eradication) may actually increase transmission. This is because vectors are likely to seek out, feed on, and infect the hosts that remain following culling efforts, and the remaining hosts will subsequently also be fed on by a greater number of susceptible vectors per host. 57 Control of frequency-dependent pathogens by culling would thus be expected to result in short but intensified epizootics that may result in additional human infections, with the exact public burden depending in part on patterns of vector feeding on humans and other hosts. 54, 58 Active or passive use of animals to divert vector feeding away from humans to protect them against infection, so-called zooprophylaxis, 59 has met with mixed effects because feeding on additional alternative hosts sometimes results in increased vector densities which may result in higher transmission even if a smaller proportion feed on humans. 60, 61 A more recent incarnation of this basic idea, termed the ""dilution effect"", hypothesizes that naturally occurring biodiversity may, in some instances, play the same role. 62 As with empirical attempts of zooprophylaxis, the effects of biodiversity, or, more accurately, variable host community assemblages, are not uniform with respect to risk of infection, due to the complexity of host-vector-pathogen interactions. 63, 64 A more direct strategy, vector control targeted at larval mosquitoes (including elimination of larval habitat), can sometimes be more effective and has even resulted in the local eradication of a disease. 65 In addition, recent techniques to develop vectors resistant to pathogens by infecting them with naturally occurring intracellular insect parasites (e.g., Wolbachia) offer some promise. 66 In many cases the most effective public health strategies in the long term will combine efforts by clinicians and public health officials to treat and alter the behavior of patients to avoid infection with actions by others to reverse the ecological drivers of transmission. The former is especially important at the leading edge of invading endemic or exotic pathogens where personal protective behaviors are often absent. Reversing ecological drivers of disease emergence requires identifying the causes of increases in incidence and targeting them with appropriate control measures, which requires integration between researchers, public health agencies, the government and the public. For example, risk related to specific types of land-use may be ameliorated by urban planning and by management of host and vector communities through landscaping, hunting, or restoration of ecological communities. Similarly, increases in incidence related to socio-economic changes may be reduced by prudent development and assistance following disasters and social upheaval. The vaccination campaign against TBE, for example, targeted at children in Latvia in response to the massive upsurge in incidence there in the early 1990s, together with a reduction in highrisk activities in tick-infested forests presumably as a result of enhanced awareness, effectively reduced the mean national incidence by 74% from 1999, with the greatest reductions seen in counties where incidence was previously highest. 67 Even modest changes in societal structure and socio-economic development can increase exposure to zoonoses; an awareness of changing risk would allow communication of appropriate warnings to alert unsuspecting members of the public. Prevention of the introduction of foreign pathogens is far more difficult because this is commonly an inevitable consequence of the globalization of trade and travel. History suggests that successful control requires prompt identification, swift action, and occasionally draconian social measures.
 Vector-borne diseases currently impose an important global burden on public health, including widespread formerly zoonotic human diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, as well as zoonotic diseases for which humans are dead end hosts, such as Lyme disease, WNV, and CCHF. Extensive land use change, the globalization of trade and travel, and social upheaval are driving the emergence of zoonotic VBPs including along local invasion fronts. Recognizing that a large fraction of the public health burden of both endemic and exotic VBPs comes from infection at the invading front enables prospective action to address both the ecological and sociological drivers of transmission. Financial and technological hurdles persist in developing countries, making diagnosis and control difficult where these diseases are stubbornly most prevalent, and limited knowledge hinders populations in developed countries from taking actions that would minimize their impact. Development projects that address disease can help in overcoming the above challenges and can combine with clinicians and public health professionals to play important roles in reducing the burden of vector-borne disease. Temporal patterns of reported cases (in thousands) for selected introduced vector-borne pathogens (red) and emerging endemic diseases (blue) on six continents. Introduced pathogens may cause striking epidemics followed by lower incidence (WNV in North America (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm), CHIKV in Réunion 77 ), sporadic epidemics from repeated introductions and local transmission (dengue in Australia 78 ), or establishment and increased case burden (dengue in S. America 14 , http:// new.paho.org). The incidence of some endemic zoonotic vector-borne diseases has increased markedly in the past several decades (Lyme disease in North America, http://www.cdc.gov/ lyme/stats/index.html, plague in Africa 79 ), but may show different trajectories (plague in Africa vs. plague in Asia 79 ), even in neighboring regions (TBE in eastern (ex-communist) and western (historically free market) Europe) because of socioeconomic differences. CCHF is shown as endemic to Turkey because there is evidence of its presence there many years before its recent appearance in humans. The global aviation network. Lines show direct links between airports, and the colour ramp indicates passenger capacity in persons per day (red = thousands; yellow = hundreds; blue = tens). Routes linking regions at similar latitudes (in the Northern or Southern hemisphere) represent pathways that pathogens are likely to move along to reach novel regions. Note the lack of high volume air traffic to most places in Africa, regions of South America, and parts of central Asia. If travel increases in these regions additional introductions of VBPs are likely. Adapted from 80 with permission. Interactions between economic status and disease risk, particularly applicable where contact with infectious agents is due largely to human activities outdoors, such as tick-borne diseases. Increased poverty increases reliance on subsistence activities that sometimes occur in vector-infested habitats. Increased income may be associated with increased recreation (especially in Europe and North America) that may also expose individuals to vectors of disease but also allow increased access to public health. Human activities take place against a backdrop of variable inherent risk from zoonotic vector-borne pathogens, measured as the density of host-seeking infected vectors such that the overall risk curve may rise or fall.",f5904e859cbc8376f380ea3827ef9d65d5cd5c07,2012-12-01,"Kilpatrick, A.

However, the discovery that many symptomless neonates were excreting virus raised doubts about its role as a causative agent in diarrhoea in the very young and we have therefore extended our studies to six hospital nurseries in the greater metropolitan area of Sydney. Most of the neonates were less than 7 days old. Specimens were transported to the laboratory within 24 h and stored at -20&deg;C until processed. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 7000 g for 20 min and the aqueous layer removed. A Philips 201 electron microscope was used. Faecal specimens from 628 neonates were processed and examined for viruses. The difference between the percentage of positive excretors in the diarrhoea group and that in the normal-baby group is statistically significant (P<0.05). Very few other viral particles were found in the deposits examined by electron microscopy. Likewise bacteriological investigations did not reveal any pathogens. However, there were significantly more neonates with diarrhoea excreting virus than the symptom-free group (p<0.05) and in the absence of any other pathogen it seems that these viruses do in fact cause diarrhoea in some neonates. It was noted that viruses from some babies were coated with an antibody-like material; this feature may be an indication of the antibody level of the mother's milk or perhaps the non-antibody virus inhibitor recently described in human and cow's milk by Matthews et al."

 ARTICLES
 Background The worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is associated with a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS.
 Methods We tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARS-CoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens. We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.
 Findings SARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically. SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS. The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection. Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia. SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.
 Interpretation Replication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emergent disease that was first reported in Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China, in November, 2002, from where it spread to other Asian countries, North America, and Europe. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] By July 3, 2003, this epidemic had resulted globally in 8439 reported cases, of which 812 were fatal. 6 Pulmonary lesions in SARS patients have been diagnosed as diffuse alveolar damage. Histological changes include desquamation of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes, flooding of alveolar lumina with oedema fluid mixed with inflammatory cells, and the presence of enlarged pneumocytes and syncytia. Alveolar walls are thickened by mild mononuclear infiltrate, and in later stages air spaces contain fibromyxoid-organising exudate. 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 Coronaviruslike particles have been detected by transmission electron microscopy in cells from a lung biopsy sample 2 and a bronchoalveolar lavage sample, 7 and in pneumocytes from a postmortem lung sample. 8 Until now, immunohistochemical detection of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in SARS-associated lesions has not succeeded. 7 Identification of the causal agent of SARS is essential to make an accurate case definition, to diagnose the disease accurately, and to develop appropriate preventive and curative treatment. Several agents have been proposed in the course of investigation of SARS. During initial investigations in China, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia sp were suggested as possible causes. 9, 10 Subsequent studies ruled out these agents and other known viral and bacterial pathogens, 3,4 except for human metapneumovirus. 5 A previoulsy unknown coronavirus was identified in patients with SARS. 2, 7, 11 It was suggested that this coronavirus, alone or in combination with human metapneumovirus or other causal agents, might be the primary cause of SARS.
 We investigated the causal role of the newly discovered SARS-CoV by analysis of the results of investigations done by the WHO network of laboratories, showing that SARS-CoV was the only agent seen consistently in patients with probable SARS. We also investigated whether respiratory lesions of SARS could be replicated in experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Replication was based on histopathology, as in a preliminary report, 12 and on localisation of SARS-CoV to the typical pulmonary lesions by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.
 Newly discovered coronavirus as the primary cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
 All patients in this study fitted the WHO case definition for SARS (table 1). 1 Some of the data on various proportions of patients in cohorts 1, 2 2, 13 3, 8 [5] [6] [7] [8] 7 and 9, 11, and 12 11 have been published previously.
 Antibody to SARS-CoV was detected in paired acute and convalescent sera by use of an indirect immunofluorescence assay 2 for patients in all cohorts. In addition, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 7 was used with minor modifications in cohorts 8 and 10. Antibody to human metapneumovirus was detected in paired acute and convalescent sera by use of an immunofluorescence assay on human-metapneumovirusinfected fetal rhesus monkey kidney (FRhK-4) cells 14 for 32 patients in cohort 1, and for all patients who were human-metapneumovirus culture positive in cohorts 3 and 4. IgA-specific and IgG-specific EIA were used for the remaining five patients in cohort 1, and for all patients in cohort 8. An IgA-specific EIA was used for patients in cohort 5. These tests are under development for commercial distribution (Meddens Diagnostics, Vorden, Netherlands).
 The clinical samples from which RNA extracts were obtained varied among cohorts and included swabs from nose, pharynx, or conjunctiva, aspirates from nasopharynx or trachea, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, faeces, urine, sputum, and blood. Samples included postmortem lung tissue in cohort 3, and from various organs in cohort 8. The RT-PCR for SARS-CoV on clinical samples was done according to Peiris and colleagues' method 2 for cohorts 1-3, and according to that by Drosten and colleagues 11 for cohorts 9, 11, and 12. Comparable tests that used primer pair COR-1/COR-2 were used for cohorts [5] [6] [7] 15 primer pairs Cor-p-F3/Cor-p-R1 and 2Bp/4Bm for cohort 10, 15, 16 and primer pairs COR-1/COR-2 and SAR1s/SAR1 as for cohort 8. 15 Virus isolation procedures for SARS-CoV were done by inoculation of samples on to Vero cells for cohorts 4-7, and on to HeLa, human embryonic lung, LLC, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, and Vero cell lines for cohort 8. Presence of virus was confirmed by immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, or both.
 The RT-PCR for human metapneumovirus on clinical samples was done according to Peiris and colleagues' method 2 for cohorts 1 and 3, with use of primer pair L6 (5Ј-CATGCCCACTATAAAAGGTCAG-3Ј) and L7 (5Ј-CACCCCAGTCTTTCTTGAAA-3Ј) for cohorts 5-7, according to the method of Peret and colleagues, 17 with conventional and real-time PCR for cohort 8, with use of a family-specific primer pair according to Drosten and colleagues 11 for cohort 9, for cohort 10 with use of N and F gene-based primers, and by nested PCR with use of the outer primer pair P9 (5Ј-GATCAACATATCT TCAGTCCAGAC-3Ј) and P10 (5Ј-AAAAGCATGATC CGATATGAACCC-3Ј) and L6 and L7 as inner primer pair for cohorts 11 and 12. In addition, for cohort 8 samples were inoculated onto HeLa, human embryonic lung, LLC, Madin-Darby canine kidney, and Vero cell lines for 28 days at 33ºC.
 For cohort 4, nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were inoculated onto LLC-MK2 rhesus monkey kidney cell and human laryngeal carcinoma cell (HEp-2) monolayers and incubated at 37ºC for 12-14 days (HEp-2 cells) or 21 days (LLC-MK2 cells) in a roller tube culture system. These cell lines were selected based on the results of an initial assessment. 18 Irrespective of the presence of cytopathic effect, cell culture supernatants were testd for human metapneumovirus by nested RT-PCR with use of the outer primer pair (5Ј-AGCTGTTCCATTGG CAGCA-3Ј) and (5Ј-ATGCTGTTCRCCYTCAAC TTT-3Ј; R=A or G, Y=C or T) and the inner primer pair (5Ј-GAGTAGGGATCATCAAGCA-3Ј) and (5Ј-GCT TAGCTGRTATACAGTGTT-3Ј). All PCR products were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. In addition, all cell cultures positive for human metapneumovirus rtPCR were passaged on to another LLC-MK2 rhesus monkey kidney cell culture tube and incubated for 21 days. Randomly selected supernatants of cell cultures with cyopathic effect were examined by electron microscopy for the presence of virus particles.
 We made the virus stock used to inoculate cynomolgus macaques from the fourth passage of a SARS-CoV isolate, obtained from patient 5688, who died of SARS, and inoculated it on to Vero 118 cells cultured in Iscove's Modified Dulbeco's Medium (Bio Whitaker, Walkersville, MD, USA). After centrifugation at 270 g for 5 min, 1 mL samples were made from the supernatant and from the pelleted cells, which were resuspended in 5 mL medium. The titre of this virus stock was 1ϫ10 6 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) per mL. All cell cultures were done under biosafety level 3 conditions. Four adult cynomolgus macaques, two males and two females, were placed in negatively pressurised glove boxes. They were infected with 1ϫ10 6 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV suspended in 5 mL phosphate-buffered saline. 4 mL was applied intratracheally, 0·5 mL intranasally, and 0·25 mL on each conjunctiva. We checked the macaques daily for clinical signs. Just before infection and at days 2, 4, and 6 after infection, we anaesthetised the macaques with ketamine and collected 10 mL blood from inguinal veins, and took nasal, oral, pharyngeal, and rectal swabs, which were placed in 1 mL virus transport medium. 19 From macaques 3 and 4, we also collected sputum samples by use of swabs under the tongue and sponges placed in the buccal cavity during anaesthesia. We extracted fluid from the sponges by centrifugation. The macaques were euthanised 6 days after infection by exsanguination under ketamine anesthesia.
 We did necropsies of the macaques according to a standard protocol. For histological examination we collected the following tissues: adrenal gland, aorta, axillary lymph node, brachial biceps muscle, brain stem, caecum, cerebellum, cerebrum, colon, duodenum, eye, Tissues for light-microscope examination were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and 4 m sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Selected lung sections were stained with monoclonal antibody AE1/AE3 (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA, USA) for the identification of epithelial cells, and monoclonal antibody CD68 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for the identification of macrophages according to standard immunohistochemical procedures.
 We developed an immunohistochemical method for detecting SARS-CoV antigen. Duplicate sections of all tissue samples were stained with an avidin-biotin complex peroxidase method. Paraffin was removed from sections, which were rehydrated and pretreated with protease (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for 10 min at 37ºC. Endogenous peroxidase was revealed with 4-chloro-1-naphthol (Sigma). Endogenous biotin was blocked with an avidin-biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Slides were briefly washed with 0·05% phosphate-buffered saline Tween 20 (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and incubated with biotinylated purified human IgG from a convalescent SARS patient, negative control biotinylated purified human IgG, or the dilution buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, sections were incubated with avidin-biotin complex-horseradish peroxidase (Dako) for 1 h at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase activity was revealed by incubating slides in 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma) solution for 10 min, resulting in a bright red precipitate. Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. Tissue sections from cynomolgus macaques that had not been infected with SARS-CoV were included as negative controls. We included formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded SARS-CoV-infected or uninfected Vero 118 cells in each staining as positive and negative controls, respectively.
 For negative contrast electron microscopy, samples of tissue culture supernatants were centrifuged at 17 000 g at 4ºC, after which the pellet was resuspended in phosphatebuffered saline and stained with phosphotungstic acid. Samples of lung from macaque 3 were fixed for transmission electron microscopy in 4% formaldehyde and 1% glutar(di)aldehyde after brief fixation in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide. After embedding in epoxy resin, thin sections were prepared, stained with 6% saturated uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a Philips Morgagni 268D electron microscope.
 Samples from lung, duodenum, jejunum, kidney, liver, and spleen were collected post mortem for virus isolation and RT-PCR. Additionally, we collected the following samples for RT-PCR only: cerebellum, cerebrum, ileum, intestinal contents from the colon, mesenteric lymph node, nasal septum, pancreas, skin, spleen, stomach, tonsil, trachea, tracheobronchial lymph node, urinary bladder, and urine. From macaques 3 and 4, samples of intestinal contents from the jejunum, ileum, and caecum were also collected for RT-PCR. Intestinal contents were pretreated with stool transport and recovery buffer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) before further processing. Tissue samples were homogenised in 4 mL transport medium 19 with Polytron PT2100 tissue grinders (Kinematica, Littau-Lucerne, Switzerland). After lowspeed centrifugation, the homogenates were frozen at -70ºC until inoculation on Vero 118 cell cultures in logarithmic dilutions. The infectious virus titres were expressed as TCID 50 /g of tissue. The identity of the isolated virus was confirmed as SARS-CoV by RT-PCR of supernatant.
 We developed an RT-PCR with primers and probe specific for the nucleoprotein gene of SARS-CoV because the nature of the coronavirus replication cycle 20 suggested that such an assay may be more sensitive than RT-PCRs based on the polymerase gene, which are currently in use for diagnostics. Nucleic acid isolation was done on the Magnapure LC automated nucleic acid isolation system (Roche Diagnostics). Swabs, faeces, and serum were processed with the Magnapure LC total nucleic acid serum plasma blood isolation kit. Postmortem tissue samples were processed with the Magnapure LC RNA isolation kit I on the Magnapure LC station using the external lysis protocol. SARS-CoV RNA was detected on the ABI prism 7700, with use of the EZ rTtH RNA amplification kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Primers SARSNP fpr1 (5Ј-CAAACATTGGCCG CAAATT-3Ј), SARSNP rpr1 (5Ј-CAATGCGTGACA TTCCAAAGA-3Ј), and probe SARSNP prb1 (5Ј-CACAATTTGCTCCAAGTGCCTCTGCA-3Ј) (Eurogentec) specific for the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of SARS-CoV were used for amplification. Amplification parameters were 2 min at 50ºC, 30 min at 60ºC, 5 min at 95ºC, and 45 cycles of 30 s at 95ºC, and 1 min at 62ºC.
 We compared the sensitivity of the SARS-CoV NP rtPCR with a SARS-CoV polymerase rtPCR that used essentially the same methods with primers and probe specific for the SARS-CoV polymerase (SARSTM fpr1
 . Serial dilutions of the SARS-CoV virus stock and SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells from patient 5688 were made and tested with the NP and polymerase-specific RT-PCRs.
 Samples from the respiratory tract (nasal swabs, pharyngeal swabs, postmortem trachea, and lung samples) were also monitored for influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, rhinovirus, coronavirus (OC43 and 229E), and human metapneumovirus with use of essentially the same RT-PCR methods but with specific primers.
 We detected antibody to SARS-CoV in macaque sera by use of an indirect immunofluorescence assay. SARS-CoV-infected Vero 118 cells that had developed cytopathic effect were used to coat microscope slides. After incubation of the serum for 30 min at 37ºC, slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with antihuman IgG, IgA, and IgM, conjugated with fluorescein thiocyanate (Dako). After washing and drying, slides were examined with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioscope, Oberkochen, Germany).

 Overall, 75% of patients who had suspected SARS according to the WHO case definition were diagnosed as being infected with probable SARS-CoV, whereas 12% were diagnosed as having human metapneumovirus infection (table 2). The high proportion of patients diagnosed with human metapneumovirus infection could be attributed mainly to cohort 4, in which 36% of patients were positive for this infection. Without this cohort, the overall proportion of human metapneumovirus diagnoses decreased to 4%. Alternative diagnoses in patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV infection were influenza (five), M pneumoniae infection (one), and Legionella sp infection (one).
 Three macaques (1, 2, and 4) became lethargic from days 2-3 after infection onwards. Macaques 1 and 2 developed a temporary skin rash at day 4 after infection. Macaque 2 had respiratory distress, consisting of an increased respiratory rate and dyspnoa, from day 4 after infection onwards. Macaques 2-4 had multiple foci of pulmonary consolidation in both lungs. The consolidated lung tissue was grey-red, firm, level, and less buoyant than normal. The tracheobronchial lymph nodes and spleen in these macaques were about twice the normal size. The other organs in these three macaques, as well as the respiratory tract and other organs of macaque 1 were normal on microscopic inspection. The main lesion in the consolidated pulmonary tissue of macaques 2-4 involved the alveoli and bronchioles, and consisted of areas with acute or more advanced phases of diffuse alveolar damage. In such areas the lumina of alveoli and bronchioles were variably filled with proteinrich oedema fluid, fibrin, erythrocytes, and cellular debris, a moderate number of alveolar macrophages, and fewer neutrophils and lymphocytes (figure 1). The cytoplasm of some of these macrophages contained erythrocytes or pools of oedema fluid. There was extensive loss of epithelium from alveolar and bronchiolar walls. In areas with more advanced diffuse alveolar damage, the alveolar walls were moderately thickened and lined by cuboidal epithelial cells (type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia), and the alveolar lumina contained mainly alveolar macrophages (figure 1). Regeneration of epithelium was seen in some bronchioles, visible as one irregular layer of squamous to high cuboidal epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. In some areas, the alveolar walls were lined by deep eosinophilic hyaline membranes (figure 1). There were occasional multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) in bronchioles and alveoli, either attached to the wall or free in the lumen (figure 1). These syncytia had up to about 30 peripheral nuclei, abundant hyaline eosinophilic cytoplasm, and, based on positive CD68 staining and negative pan-keratin staining, originated from marcophages. Enlarged type 2 pneumocytes with large vacuolated nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant vesicular cytoplasm were frequently found attached to the alveolar walls (figure 2). The epithelial origin of these cells was confirmed by keratin expression (figure 2). By contrast, alveolar macrophages had smaller nuclei, less prominent nucleoli, and were generally loose in the alveolar lumina (figure 2). The identity of these cells as macrophages was confirmed by CD68 staining (figure 2). Alveolar and bronchiolar walls were thickened by oedema fluid, mononuclear cells, and neutrophils. There were aggregates of lymphocytes around small pulmonary vessels. Moderate numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages were present in the lamina propria and submucosa of the bronchial walls, and a few neutrophils in the bronchial epithelium.
 Changes in other tissues of macaques 2-4 were diffuse lymphoid hyperplasia and sinus histiocytosis of the tracheobronchial lymph nodes. Macaques 2 and 3 also had diffuse intrafollicular hyalinosis of the spleen. There were minimum multifocal inflammatory lesions in the pulmonary tissue of macaque 1, consisting of increased numbers of alveolar macrophages (about ten per alveolus) and occasional syncytia in alveoli and bronchioles.
 With use of a biotinylated IgG fraction from a SARS patient, SARS-CoV expression was detected in a few to moderate numbers of alveolar epithelial cells (type 2 pneumocytes; figure 3 ) and rare intrabronchiolar and intra-alveolar syncytia ( Ultrastructurally, coronavirus-like particles measuring about 70 nm in diameter with typical internal nucleocapsid-like structure and club-shaped surface projections were found in enlarged alveolar epithelial cells (type 2 pneumocytes) of inflamed lung tissue from macaque 3. The particles were localised within smoothwalled vesicles, often closely associated with the Golgi apparatus ( figure 4) . The particles in inflamed lung tissue were similar in size and structure to coronavirus particles in Vero 118 cells infected with SARS-CoV ( figure 4) .
 The NP-specific RT-PCR was about 100-fold more sensitive than the polymerase-gene-based RT-PCR on the virus stock and the infected cell dilution series. The NP RT-PCR also was more sensitive based on detection of viral RNA in samples obtained from the SARS-CoVinfected macaques (data not shown).
 The macaques shed SARS-CoV from sputum, nose, and pharynx from 2 days after infection onwards (table 3) . SARS-CoV was isolated from the nasal and throat swabs from macaque 2 at 2 days after infection, from the throat swabs of macaque 4 at days 2, 4, and 6 after infection, and from sputum samples of macaque 4 at days 2 and 6 after infection. The virus titre in these samples was not measured. Several other clinical samples were positive only by RT-PCR (table 3) . By negative-contrast electron microscopy, coronavirus particles were seen in cell cultures obtained from nasal swabs (figure 4) and closely resembled those in the virus stock used to infect the macaques ( figure 4) . Virus was not detected in rectal swabs. SARS-CoV was isolated from the lung (1ϫ10 5 TCID 50 /g tissue) and kidney (1ϫ10 3 TCID 50 /g tissue) of macaque 2, and from the lung (1ϫ10 4 TCID 50 /g tissue) of macaque 4. No virus was isolated from the postmortem samples of macaques 1 or 3. Several other tissues were positive only by RT-PCR (table 4) . No macaque had detectable antibody to SARS-CoV by day 6 after infection.
 Virological examinations of nasal and pharyngeal swabs, and tracheal and lung samples from all four macaques by RT-PCR for influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, rhinovirus, coronavirus (OC43 and 229E) and human metapneumovirus were negative.
 No relevant pathogens were identified on bacteriological culture of lung and blood samples. The lung homogenates tested negative for Chlamydia sp and C pneumoniae by PCR.
 According to Koch's postulates, as modified by Rivers for virus diseases, 23 six criteria need to be fulfilled for a particular micro-organism to be the causal agent of a disease. Laboratory investigations of clinical and postmortem samples from SARS patients, as presented here and in earlier studies 2,5,7,11 already fulfilled the first three criteria-isolation of the virus from diseased hosts, cultivation in experimental hosts or host cells, and proof of filterability (to exclude larger pathogens). The results of our studies on SARS-CoV-infected macaques fulfill the remaining postulates-production of a comparable disease in the original host or a related species, and reisolation of the virus. Detection of a specific immune response to the virus after experimental infection was already reported. 12 Together, these findings prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.
 The primary role of SARS-CoV in the cause of SARS is suggested by the cumulative studies at WHO laboratories, in which most SARS patients were diagnosed as having SARS-CoV infection, frequently in the absence of other respiratory pathogens. The most common co-infection in SARS patients was with human metapneumovirus. The SARS patients in cohort 4 co-infected with human metapneumovirus were mostly health-care workers from the same ward and who shared resting areas. The circulation of this infection among them during the SARS outbreak probably explains the frequency of the infection in cohort 4. Similarly, four SARS patients from Canada were infected with SARS-CoV and human metapneumovirus. 5 The clinical symptoms of human metapneumovirus infection vary from mild upper-respiratory-tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. 24 The possible role of human metapneumovirus infection in exacerbating SARS remains to be assessed.
 Alternative diagnoses, such as influenza, were occasionally made among patients fitting the case definition of SARS but testing negative for SARS-CoV infection. On the basis of the current case definition, therefore, disease from SARS-CoV infection overlaps with respiratory illnesses of other causes. Alternative diagnoses are most likely in geographical areas where SARS is not endemic.
 The pulmonary lesions in SARS-CoV-infected macaques are comparable to those in SARS patients, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and to those in other respiratory coronavirus infections, such as sialodacryoadenitis virus infection in rats, 25 N D  3  ----4 -
 Results from RT-PCR or virus isolation. ND=not done. Syncytia were found commonly in bronchioles, and less frequently in alveolar ducts and alveoli, of SARS-CoVinfected macaques. Syncytia also were prominent in the alveoli of SARS patients. 3, 7, 8 Based on expression of CD68 and pan-keratin, the syncytia were of histiocytic origin in macaques (this study), and of histiocytic or epithelial origin in SARS patients. 8 The formation of syncytia in these macaques may have been induced by SARS-CoV infection, because some syncytia were positive for SARS-CoV by immunohistochemistry, and the spike protein of coronavirus induces cell to cell fusion. 20 Pneumocytes showing cytomegaly, enlarged nuclei, and prominent nucleoli were common both in SARS-CoV-infected macaques (this study) and in SARS patients. 2, 8 Such enlargement and cytologic atypia of hyperplastic type 2 pneumocytes occurs commonly in organising diffuse alveolar damage, and is non-specific. 27 The development of a specific immunohistochemical test to identify SARS-CoV antigen in histological samples allowed us to assess the cell tropism of SARS-CoV infection in macaques. Expression of SARS-CoV in the lung was restricted to pneumonic areas and localised to the cytoplasm of type 2 pneumocytes and syncytia. The infection of type 2 pneumocytes by coronavirus was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. These findings correspond to the detection of coronavirus-like particles in pneumocytes of a postmortem lung sample of a SARS patient, 8 and with the tropism of respiratory coronaviruses in pigs and rats for respiratory epithelium, and occasionally alveolar macrophages. 25, 26 On the basis of histological changes, SARS-CoV infection in the macaques primarily affected the epithelium of alveoli and bronchioles. At the time of euthanasia, 6 days after infection, most pneumonic areas showed early to advanced type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, indicating repair of alveolar walls after loss of type 1 pneumocytes. The temporal sequence of the histological changes corresponds with that of experimental infection with porcine respiratory coronavirus in pigs, in which acute changes (loss of epithelium, presence of macrophages and fibrin in airway lumina) were seen at days 2-6 after infection, and more advanced changes (type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration) were seen from days 7-11 after infection. 26 Because diffuse alveolar damage from different causes follows a common pathway, 27,28 more chronic changes in these macaques probably would have included organisation of the intra-alveolar exudate, resulting in alveolar fibrosis and bronchiolitis obliterans, as seen in SARS patients who died later in the course of disease. [3] [4] [5] The development of fibrosis is dependent on the deposition of fibrin in the alveoli rather than on the continued presence of virus infection. Onset of fibrosis is a critical feature of chronic diffuse alveolar damage, because it leads to loss of alveolar function and is irreversible. 27 In respiratory coronavirus infections in pigs and rats, viral infection of respiratory epithelium is maximum at days 3-4 after infection, and is no longer measurable by days 6-9. 25, 29 The rapid disappearance of infected cells after initial infection might explain why SARS-CoV was not found in type 1 pneumocytes, and was only occasionally found in type 2 pneumocytes in these macaques. It also might decrease the chance of detecting SARS-CoV by immunohistochemistry in postmortem lung tissue of SARS patients who die after a protracted course of disease.
 The lymphoid depletion of splenic follicles in experimentally infected macaques corresponds to that seen in a SARS patient 8 and in pigs infection with porcine respiratory coronavirus. 29 Based on these findings, together with the leucopenia observed in SARS patients, [2] [3] [4] [5] we speculate that SARS-CoV infection suppresses immunity and may predispose infected hosts to secondary infections, such as in measles virus infection. 30 Virological examination of clinical and postmortem samples of experimentally infected macaques indicates that the respiratory tract was the most important source of virus, as is probably the case in human beings. 13 Unlike in SARS patients, 13 SARS-CoV was not detected in urine or faeces of these macaques, although faeces did test positive in a previous experiment. 12 This finding may be partly explained by the early cut-off point of the experiment (6 days after infection), because SARS-CoV RNA was detected in the faeces of SARS patients in the late convalescent phase. 11 The sporadic detection by RT-PCR of SARS-CoV in the urinary bladder, stomach, duodenum, cerebrum, and spleen in infected macaques in the absence of evidence of viral replication-based on virus culture or immunohistochemistry-suggests overspill from other tissues, for example via blood. The isolation of SARS-CoV from the kidney of one macaque suggests viral replication at that site, but this theory could not be confirmed by immunohistochemistry.
 The RT-PCR based on nucleoprotein primers proved to be about 100-fold more sensitive than the existing RT-PCR, based on polymerase primers. Presumably, this difference is due to the gradient in the transcription of coronavirus RNA, with high concentrations of nucleoprotein RNA and low concentrations of polymerase RNA. 20 Collectively, these results of laboratory studies of SARS patients and experimental infections of macaques prove that the newly discovered SARS-CoV is the primary causal agent of SARS. Based on histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of postmortem tissues of these macaques, SARS-CoV infection primarily affects epithelium of the lower respiratory tract, with potentially severe consequences for respiratory function.

Their medical records were compiled and reviewed by their attending physicians. Spouses provided written informed consent for data and samples to be used for research and reporting purposes. Positive control for Orf1a and upE real-time RT-PCR was an in-vitro transcribed RNA, combining the sequences of the Orf1a gene (from nucleotide 11172 to nucleotide 11414) and the upE gene (from nucleotide 27357 to nucleo tide 27670) as the positive strand, designed based on the fi rst published sequence of MERS-CoV. 5 We did confi rmatory sequence analysis on the RdRp and N gene regions as described. 15 We assembled sequences using CLC Main WorkBench 6.8. The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. Patient 1, a 64-year-old man, visited Dubai from April 9, to April 17, 2013. His existing treatments were mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, and prednisone. At that time, he did not have any respiratory symptoms (cough or dyspnoea). Table 1 summarises biological data for patient 1. Treatment with ceftriaxone was initiated on April 24. An abdominal CT scan done on April 24 did not show any evidence of colitis, but lower thoracic images showed major pulmonary infi ltrates (fi gure 1A). On April 26, the patient developed dyspnoea and cough. A bronchoalveolar lavage was done and cytology showed a high number of neutrophils and macrophages. Patient 1 was transferred to the Douai hospital intensive-care unit (ICU) on April 29, where non-invasive mechanical ventilation was started, and antimicrobial therapy was modifi ed to piperacilline plus tazobactam and linezolid. Persisting haemodynamic support with norepinephrine at 0·5 mg/h was necessary. As of May 27, the patient remained under ECMO therapy because of persisting severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (fi gure 1D). No nebulisers or known aerosol-generating procedures were used for patient 1. Patient 2 was discharged from the hospital to his home on April 30. Chest radiograph showed upper right lobe consolidation (fi gure 2A). The patient remained stable but with a high fever (39-40°C) between May 9 and May 12. The patient was transferred to the ICU where oxygen therapy was progressively increased. The chest radiograph also showed bilateral ground-glass opacities with major consolidation (fi gure 2D). On May 2, the National Infl uenza Center at the Institut Pasteur was notifi ed by the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance of a possible case of infection with MERS-CoV. A nasopharyngeal swab obtained from patient 1 on April 30, analysed by real-time RT-PCR, was Preliminary results of RT-PCR done on blood specimens from patient 1 on May 9 were positive for MERS-CoV in whole blood; weak but inconsistent detection was noted in plasma samples (table 3) . No other types of specimens were analysed for either patient in this timeframe. Preliminary analysis of serum samples from patient 1 from May 7 and May 9 shows reactivity in western blot with a recombinant N protein (data not shown). The sequences from both patients were identical. Our results also suggest that the best samples to detect the virus are those from the lower respiratory tract, rather than nasopharyngeal samples. Later in the course of disease, and soon after ICU admission, severe renal failure with anuria needing renal replacement therapy developed. Our report provides evidence that patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of travel to the Middle East or contact with a known MERS-CoV case in the past 12 days should be isolated and investigated using lower respiratory tract samples. Whole genome sequencing and analysis of viral population diversities will be needed to further establish the degree of variability of the viruses of the French cases relative to previous cases and to work out the relatedness of the viruses of the two patients upon transmission. Nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV has been suspected in patients and health-care workers with respiratory symptoms in Jordan in April, 2012, and in an ongoing hospital outbreak with more than 20 cases in Saudi Arabia. No aerosol-generating procedures were used with patient 1. Similarly, patient 2 was discharged from the hospital to his home and, up to now, no secondary cases have been detected in some 40 contacts. AG, SB, VE, VC, JCM, and SvdW were involved in the laboratory testing and interpretation of results from specimens. VE and SvdW did the analysis of the viral sequences.

36,36,d5418a73d5c1fd4e7b1841dd4b06b7a6363dae77,,China's distinctive engagement in global health,"China has made rapid progress in four key domains of global health. China's health aid deploys medical teams, constructs facilities, donates drugs and equipment, trains personnel, and supports malaria control mainly in Africa and Asia. Prompted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, China has prioritised the control of cross-border transmission of infectious diseases and other health-related risks. In governance, China has joined UN and related international bodies and has begun to contribute to pooled multilateral funds. China is both a knowledge producer and sharer, off ering lessons based on its health accomplishments, traditional Chinese medicine, and research and development investment in drug discovery. Global health capacity is being developed in medical universities in China, which also train foreign medical students. China's approach to global health is distinctive; diff erent from other countries; and based on its unique history, comparative strength, and policies driven by several governmental ministries. The scope and depth of China's global engagement are likely to grow and reshape the contours of global health.","In only three decades, China's global engagement has accelerated from closed autarky to open engagement; from relative isolation to integration into the world system; from a low-income to a middle-income country; and from an aid recipient to an aid donor. As a global demographic and economic giant, China's prominence in global health should not be surprising. With 18% of the world's population, China weighs heavily in all global health metrics, such as life expectancy, disease burden, and health systems. As the world's largest trading nation, its movement of goods and services is associated with transfer of health technologies, diseases, and risk factors. In health knowledge and strategies, China has a rich history of traditional medicine and has pioneered many health-care innovations.
 China's ascendency has generated many questions and some concerns. A common assumption is that China uses foreign aid to secure energy and natural resources and to expand export markets. 1,2 China's claim of aid with ""no strings attached"", is considered by some to encourage corruption, weaken accountability, or ignore human rights. 3 The international press has reported delayed and muddled notifi cation of infectious outbreaks, and much news of exported contaminated Chinese manufactured products. China is sometimes perceived as working alone and insuffi ciently cooperating with other countries.
 In this Review, we attempt to address the following questions: What is China's role in global health? Is China's engagement distinctive or similar to other countries? What does the evidence illuminate of China's global health engagement?
 China, similar to most countries, has no single offi cial source of data for global health because of the multiplicity of governmental stakeholders, the absence of a national strategy on global health, and the unclear borderline between aid and trade investments. 4 A study 5 by NYU's Wagner School has estimated China's foreign aid to Africa, Latin America, and southeast Asia from 2002 to 2007. Strange and coauthors 6 estimated all previous estimates of Chinese development fi nance to Africa. The State Council of the Chinese Government, the highest body of state administration, published white papers summ arising China's overall foreign aid in 2011 and 2014. None of the above estimations disaggregated or separately reported health aid. 7, 8 We thus have resorted to an extensive search of data from multiple Chinese sources-the State Council, the ministries of health, commerce, education, foreign aff airs, and science and technology. Reports from provincial governments, Chinese embassies abroad, and the press were searched. Altogether, we obtained data from 529 sources-425 from various websites, 70 from statistical yearbooks, 23 from regular reports, and 15 from newspapers. Data sourced came from 15 groups of organisations, including 227 sources from the ministry of commerce, 35 from the health ministry (National Health and Family Planning Commission), and 15 from ministry of education. The overwhelming proportion of these data sources are in Chinese (95%), with less than 5% in English. All data sources are shown in the appendix. Interviews were done with dozens of former offi cials, medical team members, and key provincial authorities to collect fi rst-hand information.
 Not surprisingly, the data quality is mixed, often incomplete, and the fragments need to be matched and fi tted together. The Chinese Government is essentially the only source of information, without other sources of independent verifi cation. Reports of classifi cation and nomenclature often do not follow international standards. A common limitation is the mixing of stock data versus fl ow data.
 Our compiled data, nevertheless, generate what we believe to be the most robust estimation possible. Matching and piecing together the fragments allows inconsistencies to be double checked for consistency. Most inconsistencies relate to exact numbers, but estimation of the general order of magnitude is believed to be reasonably robust. All data sources for this Review are shown in the appendix in both original Chinese and translated English.
 After introducing a framework, we present sections on China's work in health aid, health security, health governance, and knowledge exchange.
 China's participation in global health has deep historical roots, not only just in recent years. In the fi rst millennium, knowledge of medical cures were transmitted by the Silk Road that facilitated exchange between China, India, the Middle East, and Europe. 9 In the 20th century, some Chinese health crises such as the Manchurian plague epidemic captured the attention of neighbouring countries of the international community. 10 China has historically been the origin of many infectious epidemics and a source of key health innovations of breakthroughs such as the barefoot doctor (a term that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, which refers to farmers who received minimal basic medical and paramedical training and worked in rural China to promote basic hygiene, preventive health care, family planning, and treat common illnesses. The name comes from southern farmers, who would often work barefoot in the rice paddies), and artemisinin, an eff ective antimalaria drug developed from plant-based Chinese traditional medicine. 11, 12 Because there is no universal consensus for the defi nition of global health, some approaches focus on transnational health risks, which lie beyond the reach of national governments, whereas other approaches stress the global commitment and responsibility to address health inequities and to support health. 13 We have adopted a framework of global health as characterised by health and related transnational fl ows of diseases, people, money, knowledge, technologies, and ethical values. [14] [15] [16] Four domains capture these globalisation processes (fi gure 1). First, health aid aims to advance global health equity. It is the traditional area of offi cial development assistance (ODA) coordinated by organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) countries. Second, global health security should be ensured by management of interdependence in global health and mutual protection against shared and transferred risks, such as epidemic diseases. Third, health governance is needed for global stewardship to set ground rules as mediated by health diplomacy. Fourth, knowledge exchange is needed, which includes the sharing of lessons and knowledge production, ownership, and application worldwide. Knowledge centrally aff ects all four pillars of global health, and global health governance is recognised to be central to all four domains (fi gure 1).
 On the basis of this framework, China's modern timeline might be demarcated by fi ve landmarks. First, in 1963, China sent its fi rst overseas medical team to Algeria, followed 6 years later by the donation of its fi rst hospital in Tanzania. 17 The explicitly articulated purpose of China's health aid was to further political solidarity as part of China's foreign policy. Second was China's economic openings after 1978, which launched the dramatic transformation of China from a low-income to a middle-income country, leading to China qualifying as an aid recipient followed by increasingly becoming an aid donor. 17 Third, starting from 2000, China has hosted a series of Forums on China-Africa Cooperation, with each forum announcing yet another major aid pledge-eg, hospital construction, malaria control, and high education scholarships (2007-09); training of health workers and artemisinin drug donation (2010-12); and brightness action (eye care) campaign (2013-15). 18, 19 Fourth, global engagement greatly accelerated after 2001 when China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO), an event that marked China's joining almost all international bodies. Finally, and perhaps most dramatically, the 2003 severe acute repiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic underscored both China's neglect of its health sector and the reality that China's global trade cannot be done without mutual health protection. 20
 In recent years, the State Council has published two white papers in April, 2011, and July, 2014, summarising China's foreign aid by volume and type. The 2011 white paper reports foreign aid of US$37·6 billion accumulated up to and including 2009 in three categories: grants of $15·6 billion; concessional loans of $10·8 billion; and interest-free loans of $11·2 billion. This amount is fairly close to another estimate of China's foreign aid at $40·5 billion cumulative from 1950 to 2010, reaching $3·9 billion annually by 2010. 21, 22 The aid increased signifi cantly during the period of 2010-12, reaching an average of $4·8 billion per year, of which the grants accounted for 36·2%. 8 Figure 2 shows that African countries received 46% of all aid, with Asia receiving about a third (33%) and Latin America receiving around 13%, before the end of 2009. The share for African countries increased to 51·8% during the past 3 years, whereas Latin America received relatively less. 8 Another estimate computed China aid to Africa in 2008, at $1·2 billion in comparison with Japan at $1·6 billion and USA at $7·2 billion. 22 Chinese aid in health is provided in fi ve categories: medical teams, construction of hospitals, donation of drugs and equipment, training of health personnel, and malaria control. The largest share of health aid is spent on medical teams and donated facilities. The fi nancial value of Chinese in-kind health aid is diffi cult to estimate. Crudely, from 2007 to 2011, we estimated the value of Chinese medical teams in Africa to be about $60 million annually, with donated facilities at a similar amount. Total health aid to Africa annually has been estimated at about $150 million. Understanding of the type of health support off ered rather than the precise volume of funding might be more important. Diff erent from most OECD donors, China does not off er general sectoral support, albeit small cash grants given to several countries in recent years. Its health aid uses a project approach. 7 The in-kind provision in the fi ve categories is based on Chinese competencies. Health seems to constitute only a small proportion of the total Chinese aid. Health aid is mainly in donation form, whereas most of China's overall foreign aid is off ered as either concessional or interest-free loans.
 Since 1963, under the protocol on the dispatch of medical teams signed between the government of China and the recipient countries, about 23 000 Chinese medical workers have been sent to about 66 countries to provide services to an estimated 270 million people. At the end of 2013, 1171 Chinese medical workers were working in 113 medical centres in 49 countries. 42 of the countries are in Africa, and the remaining seven are mainly small countries-four in Asia, one in Europe, one in South America, and one in Oceania. 23 The table shows African countries in 2013 according to medical teams, aided facilities, and malaria control programmes, along with the Chinese provinces twinned to each country. Figure 3 shows China health aid to Africa with countries shaded according to density of medical team coverage and demarcated by aided facilities and malaria control. The distribution shows wide coverage of nearly all African countries with a higher density of medical teams in western and eastern Africa regions. The largest and most powerful African countries such as South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya do not have Chinese medical teams. Chinese selection of hosting countries is based on country request and the joint decision by China's ministries of health, foreign aff airs, and fi nance. The medical teams are overseen by the Chinese embassy economic and commercial counsellor's offi ces.
 Medical teams are fi nanced by the health aid budget in the health ministry (except the basic salaries), which is responsible for dispatching medical teams. Selected countries are twinned to specifi c Chinese provinces with public hospitals and local medical schools responsible for staffi ng, supervising, and partially funding the medical teams. 24 Some practical criteria such as willingness and workload are used to match Chinese provinces and recipient countries in the twinning arrangement.
 The number of members in medical teams ranges from a half dozen people to nearly 100, usually working out of Chinese donated hospitals and clinics. Most workers are clinicians, and most teams include a leader and a translator. Public health skills are usually not included. Medical teams mainly provide clinical services, especially for specialties in short supply-eg, surgery, gynaecology, and obstetrics. The average duration of an overseas assignment is 2 years, with team members receiving housing and food plus enhanced salaries. Over the period of 2010-12, these medical teams working in 54 countries had provided about 7 million medical consultations and treatments. 8 Panel 1 describes some of these medical teams in southern Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
 Since 1970, China has constructed more than a hundred health facilities overseas with its health aid. China accelerated its assistance in the construction of hospitals and clinics-from 2010 to 2012, China has supported about 80 construction projects of health facilities. 8 Most of these facilities are donated, and only a few are built as part of large infrastructure projects funded by Chinese loans. African countries were the recipients of more than three-quarters of the donated facilities. Although most countries have received at least one facility, some have received up to 6. These facilities are mostly so-called turnkey operations, for which Chinese construction fi rms build the facility for transfer to local authorities. Malaria control has recently been prioritised. Control programmes are undertaken through 30 anti-malaria centres, featuring artemisinin based on Chinese traditional medicine. Panel 2 describes an ambitious Chinese programme of malaria eradication with mass drug administration with artemisinin on the Comoros Islands.
 The question of whether health aid is mainly driven by China's commercial interest is not easy to investigate. Much depends upon interpretation of underlying motivation. For example, Chinese aid to Africa might be viewed as either helping the world's poorest countries or building friendship with the origin of much of the world's energy and natural resources and potential export markets. A comprehensive analysis of this question would need access to data not currently available. As a preliminary fi rst step, we attempted to examine correlations between health aid and commercial economic indicators. Regression analysis of African countries with variables of health aid (medical teams, donated facilities, malaria control) and economic interests (petroleum imports, China's foreign investment, and China's imports and exports) yielded no signifi cant pattern. Figure 4 shows four scatter-plots of China health aid and African trade. In the four diagrams, individual African countries are plotted according to health and commercial indicators. The scatter-plots did not show any association between medical aid and economic interests. Spearman's Rank Correlation and t test analysis for the period of 2002-11 showed no signifi cant fi ndings of correlations. These preliminary analyses should not be interpreted as conclusive.
 A core component of global health is mutual health protection against international transfer of health risks, which shows health interdependence. Transborder movement of infectious diseases, contaminated goods and products, air pollution, and globally pooled CO 2 are prime examples.
 For China, the 2003 SARS epidemic was a crisis with serious economic and political consequences. Both disease control and international cooperation were delayed. Chinese errors made in the early stage of SARS have been acknowledged and have generated strong corrective measures, both domestically and internationally. 28 Domestic measures include major re-investment in the public health system via the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including development of the world's largest real-time electronic surveillance system. 29 International eff orts include active participation and leadership in many international forums that foster cooperation in compliance of disease reporting and control, as shown by the initiation of the UN resolution on enhancement of capacity-building in global public health in 2003, and the joint International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Pandemic Infl uenza with China, the European Commission, and the World Bank held in Beijing in 2006. [30] [31] [32] Subsequent management of infectious outbreaks such as avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus shows that China recognises the importance of strict adherence to the International Health Regulations. In the 2003 SARS outbreak, China needed 87 days between fi rst case detection and report to WHO and another 46 days for joint teams to investigate the outbreak. For H7N9 one decade later, less than half the days lapsed between fi rst case and report to WHO and the initiation of joint investigations. [33] [34] [35] Infections can move in several directions. China has been the destination of cross-border infectious transmissions. In 2011, a polio epidemic was imported from Pakistan into China's Xinjiang province. 36 after making arduous eff orts and expending large resources. 37 Similarly, China has been threatened by the import of dengue fever, malaria, and several other transmissible diseases. 38, 39 Cross-border risks can also accompany the import and export of commodities. As the world's largest exporter of manufactured products, China, of course, transfers health risk overseas. News reports have been plentiful of contamination in Chinese exports of toothpaste, lead paint, milk products, and heparin. [40] [41] [42] [43] These safety concerns are not limited to exporters. China has also been a destination in the dumping of contaminated chemicals from richer to poorer countries; 44 these safety hazards are of equal concern to the Chinese public. These concerns might be why China has upgraded its State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) to the status of a ministry with larger budget, increased staff , and stronger regulatory powers. 45 Environmental pollution also moves across national boundaries. Air pollutants in China have been cited as causing acid rain damage to forests in Korea and Japan. 46, 47 China is today the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, contributing substantially to global climate change. 48 To tackle air pollution, China's State Council released an action plan setting a 5-year road map for air pollution control. 49 Its implementation deserves tracking for monitoring and evaluation of control eff ect.
 Health governance sets ground rules for global stewardship of diverse activities. Across the board, China has become an active member of the world system, opening with China's economic reform and accelerating after its entry into the WTO in every aspect-eg, political (UN), fi nancial (World Bank, International monetary fund), economic (WTO), and military (arm control and Data underscore the participation of China in global governance. China's receipt of net offi cial development assistance and offi cial aid peaked at about $1800 million in 2005, had steadily decreased to a third of that amount by 2010, and is already disappearing as China increasingly becomes an aid donor rather than an aid recipient. 50 From 1998 to 1999, China's receipt and contribution to WHO were equal at about $5 million. By 2012-13, China's assessed contribution to WHO had increased to $30 million, while WHO funding to China had remained at baseline. 51 In parallel with this increase in funding, the number of Chinese staff members in WHO has expanded. Whereas in 1999, there were only 12 Chinese offi cials working in WHO, that number had tripled to 34 by 2012, although Chinese staff in WHO are still under-represented. 52 Additionally, based on the newly released white paper, China allocated $280 million to support the Global Fund and other international organisations in 2010-12. 8 Global health participation by China has been mainly governmental. In non-governmental stakeholders, growth in the international participation of some academic universities, business, and industry has occurred. China has very few non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and thus the Chinese are mostly absent from global civil society forums. A few international NGOs work in China, but few have achieved offi cial registration from the Chinese Government. It will take substantial time, if ever, before China's civil society becomes active in global health.
 Knowledge is both local and global, and its production, ownership, exchange, and application have global dimensions. China has much to share with and much to learn from the rest of the world.
 In medicine, strategy, and implementation, China has had some spectacular accomplishments, worthy contributions to the world's knowledge pool. Chinese traditional medicine off ers many health-enhancing technologies-ranging from ephedrine to acu puncture. [53] [54] [55] In the 1930s, village health workers were fi eld tested, and later re-engineered as the barefoot doctor. 11 China's three-tier rural health system was established soon after the founding of the People's Republic. 56 The Alma Ata movement for primary health care took great encouragement from China in showing what barefoot doctors could do at the community level. The three decades after the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 witnessed some of the steepest advances of mortality control in human history. 57 China's management of common infectious diseases, maternal-child health, tropical disease control, malaria and schistosomiasis containment, mass social hygiene campaigns, and recent achievement of near-universal health coverage are worthy of documentation as valuable lessons.
 29 physicians, two nurses, two chefs, two translators, and one medical engineer from Shaanxi Province constituted China's 30th medical team to Sudan in 2007-09. The 15th Chinese team from Hebei Province to the Democratic Republic of the Congo arrived in 2012, consisting of a team leader, 13 physicians (including one in Chinese traditional medicine), two nurses, one French translator, and one chef. For both teams, their primary role was to provide clinical care to patients. An ancillary function was to mentor, train, and improve the skill of local health workers. Medical teams were self-suffi cient, bringing all their own supplies, equipment, and medicines. In response to questionnaires, team members commented positively on their experiences. Higher salaries, fi nancial subsidies, and allowances from both central government and employers (about a six-fold increase) operated as important incentives. Reported constraints included language barriers, unaccustomed disease profi les, poor facilities and equipment, unstable water and electricity supply, and homesickness. If the opportunity were off ered, nearly all would be willing to serve again. 25, 26 Panel 2: Traditional Chinese medicine to eradicate malaria?
 Malaria eradication in some countries had been successful with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, and hopes have focused on new vaccines. But a professor of Chinese traditional medicine from Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine is leading an unprecedented eff ort to eradicate malaria on the Comoros Islands with traditional Chinese medicine. Starting in 2007 on Moheli Island where 23% of the 36 000 residents were carriers of Plasmodium falciparum, disease prevalence has dropped to 0·3% in 4 months with mass administration of artemisinin and piperaquine, donated by China's ministry of commerce. 5 years later, the Chinese team extended this programme to Anjouan, an island of 350 000, reducing the prevalence of P falciparum carriers from 19% to 0·5%. Last year, the eff orts were expanded to the 420 000 residents of Grande Comore, the country's largest island. The project goal is malaria eradication in the 900 000 people of the Comoros by 2016. 27 Panel 3 describes an innovative grant by UK Government's Department for International Develop ment (DFID) to foster research by, and capacity building for Chinese universities and other institutions to disseminate and share Chinese lessons with other countries.
 For the future, China aspires to be a worldwide knowledge leader and it has fast growing research and development investments in biomedicine. Chakma 60 reported China's biomedical research and development at $8·4 billion in 2012, in comparison with USA ($119 billion), Europe ($82 billion), and Japan ($37 billion). The absolute size of these fi gures might undervalue Chinese investments because the lower salaries, cost of infrastructure, and cost of operations in China might not be captured fully by purchasing power parity-adjusted values. Strikingly, China's investments since 2007 have increased annually at 33% in comparison, for example, to −2% for the USA. 60 China, moreover, houses laboratories for most of the major pharmaceutical companies. It has advanced genetic research capacity as shown by its genetic sequencing of the H7N9 virus within 7 days of isolation and identifi cation. 34 China is also a growing producer and exporter of generic products. China aspires to be a powerhouse in the discovery and production of new drugs and vaccines in global health.
 China's medical universities are increasingly undertaking research and education in global health. In the past year, several new multidisciplinary centres of China supports government offi cials, technical professionals, and young people from developing countries to participate in training and education programmes in China. In 2010-12, the government provided 76 845 scholarships for such programmes, of which many were health related. 8 China's medical universities also train foreign medical students. According to the data from the China Education Yearbook, in 1999-2011, China trained 240 123 foreign medical students, who constitute 13% of all foreign students in 2011. For that year, the ministry of education reported almost 27 000 foreign medical students studying modern medicine and 12 000 studying traditional Chinese medicine. 64, 65 By 2013, China had extended authorisation to 52 medical schools to admit foreign students who will study medicine in English. 66 Figure 5 shows the rapid increase of foreign medical students and scholarships in China in 2002-11.
 Although foreign interest in traditional medicine is high, most foreign students register for modern medicine. About 10% of the foreign medical students receive Chinese Government scholarships that might be regarded as part of China's foreign health aid. Chinese medical schools charge foreign students higher than Chinese tuition fees, 67 and the schools acknowledge foreign students as a source of school revenue. In 2011, many of the students came from neighbouring Asian countries, such as India, Japan, Pakistan, South Korea, and southeast Asia.
 Our most salient fi nding is China's distinctive mode of engagement in global health. China's health aid volume is small, but the mode is distinctive, driven by China's health capabilities and national experiences. Unlike many other traditional donors, China's in-kind aid focuses more on some important aspects of the health system. China's overall global engagement follows a very diff erent path from developed countries partly because it has no colonial experience nor did it participate in shaping the American-led post-World War 2 world order. China was inward-looking until it expanded into the global economy in 1978. Over the ensuing three decades, China has had large shifts from a low-income to a middle-income country, and from aid recipient increasingly to aid donor. The spread of its foreign aid throughout the breadth of Africa presumably refl ects both eff orts to solidify friendship politically, promote mutually benefi cial economic gains, and compete with Taiwan for political friendship. 68 China's health aid is embedded in the dynamic shifting of foreign and economic policies. The opening in 1978 marked a shift from economic development serving foreign policy to foreign policy serving economic development because China's association, for example, with Africa, has developed from a political one in the 1970s to a broader economic-based and trade-based engagement. 69, 70 These are all defi ning characteristics of China's engagement in global health. China's global health work, unfortunately, does not seem to rank highly in government agencies. Health has been assigned a lower position than political and commercial aff airs. Taking advantage of both domestic and international resources and accessing both domestic and international markets is China's explicit national development strategy. 71 These powerful economic motives drive much of China's global engagement, including its engagement in Africa, to the point where the dividing line between trade and aid become blurred and hard to demarcate. 70 Health aid is only a very small adjunct to these much larger and more powerful forces.
 China's overseas forces include several government agencies. As a result, improved interministerial coordination is a necessary development for the evolution of a coherent overall engagement in global health. Formulation of a China global health strategy could help bring coherent policy and harmonised action, because it would compel the articulation of specifi c health and humanitarian objectives in Chinese governmental policies. An explicit China global health strategy would provide a stronger context for NGOs and private sector overseas participation.
 China's bilateral approach diff ers substantially from its multilateral approach. Although China's bilateralism takes an independent approach, China's multilateral strategy is full participation, joining as a regular member and complying with its responsibilities and privileges in UN bodies such as WHO. The records show that China respects and complies with rules governing multilateral institutions in all aff airs-health, trade, migration, environment, and other aspects of global governance. China has increased its contribution to multilateral funding pools, such as the Global Fund from $2 million per year in 2003, to $5 million per year in 2012. How important China will become as a major donor to these pooled funds is uncertain. Some see the early actions as symbolic gestures of cofunding, whereas others hope that the size of the Chinese economy will propel it to become a fi nancial leader of multilateral funds. The New Development Bank being established by BRICS countries aims to compete with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which is one example of how China has debatably played a leadership role. 72 Most important is the avoidance of over-simplifi cation. No country's international engagement is free from political or economic motives-eg, Europe colonialism, US millennium development accounts, or Sweden-Vietnam partnership during the American war. 73 And no single modality of foreign aid has proven to be more eff ective or more sustainable. 74,75 Although China's health aid is generally appreciated by recipient offi cial statements, there are indeed complaints about the scale of China's intrusion, access to natural resources, and the trade market in Africa. But energy resource-based trade structure with Africa does not occur only in China; it occurs with all major African trading partners. The most fundamental improvement is to increase the capacity for independent development, to which all partners in Africa should contribute.
 China's global health engagement is diffi cult to attribute to one motivation factor. Chinese driving forces are undoubtedly several and complex-political, economic, social, and humanitarian. China's approach has been characterised as pragmatic that ""combines the utilitarian logic of reaping material benefi t, the realist objective of expanding its global power and infl uence, the neo-liberalist interest in pursuing absolute gains from international cooperation, and the constructivist attempt to become a responsible stakeholder in the system"". 76 China's global health engagement will probably grow substantially with expanding budgets, more projects, and more staff sent abroad. China will pursue its own distinctive approach, not copying the developed world model; Chinese Government policy and indigenous professional capacity will be key. The fi rst generation of Chinese professionals with experience and foreign language fl uency is emerging along with stronger global health institutions. Given this trajectory, one should assume global health will likely be re-shaped by China's participation, with its structures and processes increasingly accommodating Chinese characteristics.

We also draw from lessons learned from diseases that now use only humans as transmission hosts such as malaria and dengue. 6 West Nile virus (WNV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are among the best-understood zoonotic VBPs to have emerged in the last two decades and show just how explosive epidemics can be in new regions (Fig. These past experiences, together with increases in the known drivers of pathogen introduction that we describe below, suggest that future introductions are likely. 1 A key challenge arises from the non-specificity and similarity of symptoms caused by many of these viruses, especially ZIKV, dengue and CHIKV that all present with acute fever similar to many diseases endemic in the tropics such as malaria. 12, 14 This makes rapid identification tools 15 and high quality laboratory-based diagnoses necessary for accurate surveillance and appropriate therapy. Evidence for the importance of local invasion comes from the states of Wisconsin and Virginia where Lyme cases have appeared recently in counties where few if any cases occurred previously, while in the state of Connecticut, where the first cases of Lyme were detected 3 decades ago, there is little upward trend in incidence in the last decade (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/index.html). quinquefasciatus (a vector of WNV, and filiariasis). [ 21 The recent growth in air travel enabling global transit in a single day (Fig. 2 ) has accelerated pathogen introductions because it has allowed many more pathogens that cause acute infectiousness, including many subtypes of dengue virus, CHIKV, and WNV, to reach other continents within the few days that hosts are infectious, and even during the latent period for some diseases. 24, 25 Thus, the most recent wave of pathogen introductions, and those likely to occur in the near future, take place against the backdrop of centuries of vector introductions that facilitate establishment. This leads to another common pattern, which is that the intense and rapid initial spread of a novel pathogen is frequently followed by a substantial decrease in case burden shortly after introduction, especially on a local scale. 36 More generally, greater outdoor recreational opportunities associated with increased wealth can result in increased exposure to vectors. 39 Human activities resulting in exposure to VBPs is sometimes reflected in different seasonal patterns, such as cases of TBE in different parts of Europe (Fig. 41 Understanding the mechanistic processes linking land use and socio-economic conditions to disease facilitates prediction of future trends and control or mitigation. Although several components of vector-borne disease systems (the vector and the pathogen) are highly sensitive to climate, evidence shows that climate change has been less important in the recent emergence of vector-borne diseases than changes in land use, human living conditions, and societal factors, likely to be a result of countering influences (Box 1). The differential influence of climate at the edge and core of a pathogen's distribution stems in part from the nonlinear relationship between the fraction of the human population exposed and transmission intensity; the latter can be quantified as R 0 , the pathogen reproductive ratio. It should be noted that expansions in the distribution of a disease may have disproportionate impacts on public health if newly exposed populations there have little immunity. 44
 Although it is now well established in the scientific community that climate change has played and will play a mixed and relatively minor role in the emergence of most VBPs and diseases in general, 68, 69 there is nonetheless a persistent stream of review articles that claim that climate change is a significant driving force for the emergence of VBPs. 73 The effects of climate on transmission are multiple, non-linear, and act in opposing directions. 76 Thus, while continuing climate change may increase transmission or distributions of some VBPs in the future, other factors will frequently play a more significant role and, importantly, be more tractable to public health initiatives. These include changes in the biotic elements of the environment (e.g. wildlife hosts), drug resistance, reduced health service provision, and political and socio-economic factors that change human exposure and susceptibility to infections. Predictions will require truly cross-disciplinary collaborations, marrying biologists' pursuit of better models of vector abundance, infection prevalence and pathogen evolution (e.g. drug resistance) with understanding from medical and social scientists about developments in treatment and interventions, land use change, and human societal factors. The relative contributions of each factor can only be rigorously assessed by careful comparisons of the same pathogen over time and with valid accurate baseline data, in contrast to a recent study. 50, 51 Similarly, on La Réunion a single nucleotide change occurred in CHIKV between 2005 and 2006 that increased infection in the recently introduced mosquito species, Ae. aegypti became the main vector in India from 2007, however, the same genetic substitution spread rapidly and subsequent substitutions appear to be facilitating even more efficient virus circulation and persistence, which may presage further expansion of CHIKV ranges. aegypti and, to slightly lesser extent, Ae. albopictus, which sometimes feeds on nonhuman mammals and birds. 1 ) highlight the need for effective control and treatment of individuals suffering from associated diseases. A key challenge in attempting to control many VBPs is that they are zoonotic and transmission intensity is driven primarily by wildlife reservoirs. 60, 61 A more recent incarnation of this basic idea, termed the ""dilution effect"", hypothesizes that naturally occurring biodiversity may, in some instances, play the same role. 62 As with empirical attempts of zooprophylaxis, the effects of biodiversity, or, more accurately, variable host community assemblages, are not uniform with respect to risk of infection, due to the complexity of host-vector-pathogen interactions. 66 In many cases the most effective public health strategies in the long term will combine efforts by clinicians and public health officials to treat and alter the behavior of patients to avoid infection with actions by others to reverse the ecological drivers of transmission. The vaccination campaign against TBE, for example, targeted at children in Latvia in response to the massive upsurge in incidence there in the early 1990s, together with a reduction in highrisk activities in tick-infested forests presumably as a result of enhanced awareness, effectively reduced the mean national incidence by 74% from 1999, with the greatest reductions seen in counties where incidence was previously highest. History suggests that successful control requires prompt identification, swift action, and occasionally draconian social measures. Financial and technological hurdles persist in developing countries, making diagnosis and control difficult where these diseases are stubbornly most prevalent, and limited knowledge hinders populations in developed countries from taking actions that would minimize their impact. Temporal patterns of reported cases (in thousands) for selected introduced vector-borne pathogens (red) and emerging endemic diseases (blue) on six continents. Lines show direct links between airports, and the colour ramp indicates passenger capacity in persons per day (red = thousands; yellow = hundreds; blue = tens). Routes linking regions at similar latitudes (in the Northern or Southern hemisphere) represent pathways that pathogens are likely to move along to reach novel regions. If travel increases in these regions additional introductions of VBPs are likely. Increased poverty increases reliance on subsistence activities that sometimes occur in vector-infested habitats."

This regression of the CTG repeat length may be the main cause of the longevity of DM alleles in the population, as evidenced by the strength of the linkage disequilibrium seen between genetic markers which map very close to the CTG repeat and DM.1 The sex difference in the frequency at which contraction occurs may well be a major contributing factor to explain why the congenital form of DM is only inherited maternally. This difference, coupled with the decreased fertility of men bearing large amplifications, may explain this finding.
 The case in which congenital DM is inherited despite a 3 kb contraction on transmission from mother to son has important implications for presymptomatic and antenatal diagnosis of DM, since until this case, it was assumed that a contraction on transmission would correspond to a decrease in the severity of the phenotype.2-S","1.

Shelbourne P, Winqvist R, Kunert Bacterial identification of adult lower respiratory tract infection SIR,-Dr Macfarlane and colleagues (Feb 27, p 511) draw attention to community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). We take issue with most of their conclusions, since their methodology is inadequate. Their finding that most identified cases were diagnosed as having a bacterial infection does not imply genuine cause and effect. Previous studies in wheezing illness have shown that bacterial identification rates are the same whether the subjects were wheezy or symptom-free,! with up to 24% of symptom-free cases being positive on bacterial cu1ture.2 In Macfarlane's study bacterial cultures were not obtained in healthy subjects nor in patients when they were symptom-free, and thus the significance of a positive culture is unclear. Viral shedding is greatest within 1 day of symptoms and since symptoms had been present for at least 7 days in 67% of the cases, it is hardly surprising that the virus isolation rate (not precisely specified in the paper) was so low. Even with better clinical sampling techniques than those used, the use of ""standard laboratory methods"" is not adequate to identify most respiratory viruses. Respiratory viruses are notoriously difficult to culture, especially coronavirus and rhinovirus, which need very specialised culture conditions.2 Nasal aspirate or washing offers greater sensitivity for respiratory viral culture.3 Likewise, serological testing is insensitive for respiratory viral diagnosis. It cannot identify rhinovirus, nor, without specialised techniques, coronavirus, and in Macfarlane's study parainfluenza was not sought. Together these viruses probably account for over threequarters of respiratory viral infections. 4 These deficiencies are underscored by a recent community-based longitudinal study in school children with persistent lower respiratory tract symptoms which used the polymerase chain reaction together with more traditional diagnostic methods. Respiratory virus infections were identified in 81% of wheezing episodes and in 83% of episodes with both upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms and a fall in peak flow-the identification rate in the same children when symptom-free was 12%. 4 We estimate that had this study used the same methodology as Macfarlane et al the identification rate would have been I % and the researchers would have erroneously concluded that viruses are unimportant in wheezing episodes in children.
 Despite these shortcomings, the study has been successful in identifying the scale of LRTI in the UK, but has advanced us no nearer to identifying the causes. In particular, the place of antibiotic therapy should remain open to question since, despite treatment with antibiotics, 26% of patients in Macfarlane's study asked to see their general practitioners again because of unsatisfactory clinical progress. Although the polymerase chain reaction for virus identification was presumably not available when this study was planned, in any future investigations this technique must be used. Authors'reply SIR,-We accept that present methods for diagnosing the pathogen causing LRTI are not wholly satisfactory, but our conclusion that the range of causative pathogens identified in our patients with such infection is similar to that for communityacquired pneumonia remains valid since our previous studies and those of others have used similar diagnostic techniques. We clearly stated our criteria for diagnosis of infection, which were similar to those in previous studies, including those used in the British Thoracic Society study.1 Dr Doull and Dr Johnston's criticisms mainly relate to the diagnosis of viral infections. However, our study was of LRTI in general practice and not of wheezing illness in childhood and adult asthmatics referred to in their references. We agree that viral shedding is greatest at the start of symptoms, but we are uncertain how they suggest we could exploit this fact when studying a large unselected population who only seek help because of continuing symptoms. We are also uncertain how we could have had access to the elegant methods that Doull and Johnston describe in a twelve author, unpublished paper due to come out in a European Journal. THE LANCET Doull and Johnston question the relevance of a positive bacterial diagnosis, and indeed this is a difficulty, but they do not suggest a practical alternative. The reference they cite of bacterial infection in asthamtics2 failed to identify any cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae infections, with, surprisingly, Pseudomonas species being most common. In our study, bacterial culture of healthy subjects would not have been appropriate since previously well subjects would not have a productive cough. The criteria that we used for bacterial infection, the presence of recognised pathogens in 1W dilution of sputum show that bacteria cause infections more than previously supposed. In unpublished data,3 the detection of pneumococcal antigen in measurable titre in sputum equated well with other evidence of lower respiratory pneumococcal infection, supporting the idea that detection of bacterial antigen is a useful added method.
 We feel that viral infection is probably important in the initiation of many bacterial infections of respiratory tract but that the secondary bacterial infection is likely to be a cause of morbidity as well as being potentially amenable to antimicrobial therapy. We too look forward to the day when more sensitive and specific tests are avialable for investigating this very common clinical problem. SIR,-Community-acquired adult LRTI is common, as Dr Macfarlane and colleagues point out. Sputum and blood cultures have become routine for all patients with fever and chest radiographic changes compatible with pneumonia. 20-30% of blood cultures are claimed to be positive and blood cultures are regarded as essential in all patients suspected of pneumonia.1,2 We examined blood cultures from a total of 277 patients admitted with suspected pneumonia to evaluate their value as a diagnostic aid. The spectrum of pathogens proved similar to that recorded in the community by Macfarlane and colleagues. All patients had clinical signs of pneumonia&mdash;ie, fever, shortness of breath, and radiological changes on their chest radiograph. 130 patients had 20 mL and 147 had 40 mL venous blood drawn to investigate whether the amount of blood affected the sensitivity of the test. Patients underwent standard treatment and subsequently received penicillin 2 million IU intravenously thrice daily until their clinical condition allowed oral penicillin treatment: In the 130 patients with 20 mL samples (10 mL for aerobic and 10 mL for anaerobic culturing) Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 6 (2 patients were treated with penicillin before admission), Staphylococcus epidemddis in 2 (probably contamination), and Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1 each. 45 patients (35%) were treated with antibiotics before admission and blood culture: only 2 patients, 1 with E coli (ampicillin) and 1 with Klebsiella pneumrneiae (penicillin) had their antibiotic treatment changed on the basis of the microbiological diagnosis. In the 147 patients with 40 mL blood samples (20 mL for aerobic and 20 mL for anaerobic culturing), Streptococcus pneumoniae (sensitive to penicillin) was isolated in 8 and Staphylococcus aureus in 1. This last patient had his antibiotic treatment changed on the basis of the microbiological diagnosis and lack of response to penicillin treatment. 50 patients (34%) received antibiotics before admission and blood culture.
 Blood cultures in the diagnosis of microbiological pathogens in radiologically verified pneumonia had a low diagnostic sensitivity of less than 1 %-ie, in 277 patients, antibiotic treatment was changed in only 3 as a result of blood cultures. We therefore suggest that blood cultures are used in cases of severe life-threatening pneumonia only. Diagnostic sensitivity does not seem to be affected by the amount of blood drawn. Penicillin seems still to be first choice in community-acquired, radiological-verified pneumonia.

[ 6 Pulmonary lesions in SARS patients have been diagnosed as diffuse alveolar damage. Several agents have been proposed in the course of investigation of SARS. During initial investigations in China, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia sp were suggested as possible causes. 9, 10 Subsequent studies ruled out these agents and other known viral and bacterial pathogens, 3,4 except for human metapneumovirus. We investigated the causal role of the newly discovered SARS-CoV by analysis of the results of investigations done by the WHO network of laboratories, showing that SARS-CoV was the only agent seen consistently in patients with probable SARS. Antibody to SARS-CoV was detected in paired acute and convalescent sera by use of an indirect immunofluorescence assay 2 for patients in all cohorts. In addition, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 7 was used with minor modifications in cohorts 8 and 10. In addition, for cohort 8 samples were inoculated onto HeLa, human embryonic lung, LLC, Madin-Darby canine kidney, and Vero cell lines for 28 days at 33ºC.
 For cohort 4, nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were inoculated onto LLC-MK2 rhesus monkey kidney cell and human laryngeal carcinoma cell (HEp-2) monolayers and incubated at 37ºC for 12-14 days (HEp-2 cells) or 21 days (LLC-MK2 cells) in a roller tube culture system. All PCR products were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. 4 mL was applied intratracheally, 0·5 mL intranasally, and 0·25 mL on each conjunctiva. We checked the macaques daily for clinical signs. Paraffin was removed from sections, which were rehydrated and pretreated with protease (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for 10 min at 37ºC. Endogenous peroxidase was revealed with 4-chloro-1-naphthol (Sigma). Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. We included formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded SARS-CoV-infected or uninfected Vero 118 cells in each staining as positive and negative controls, respectively. From macaques 3 and 4, samples of intestinal contents from the jejunum, ileum, and caecum were also collected for RT-PCR. Tissue samples were homogenised in 4 mL transport medium 19 with Polytron PT2100 tissue grinders (Kinematica, Littau-Lucerne, Switzerland). The infectious virus titres were expressed as TCID 50 /g of tissue. Postmortem tissue samples were processed with the Magnapure LC RNA isolation kit I on the Magnapure LC station using the external lysis protocol. SARS-CoV-infected Vero 118 cells that had developed cytopathic effect were used to coat microscope slides. Without this cohort, the overall proportion of human metapneumovirus diagnoses decreased to 4%. Three macaques (1, 2, and 4) became lethargic from days 2-3 after infection onwards. Macaques 1 and 2 developed a temporary skin rash at day 4 after infection. Macaque 2 had respiratory distress, consisting of an increased respiratory rate and dyspnoa, from day 4 after infection onwards. Macaques 2-4 had multiple foci of pulmonary consolidation in both lungs. The consolidated lung tissue was grey-red, firm, level, and less buoyant than normal. There was extensive loss of epithelium from alveolar and bronchiolar walls. In some areas, the alveolar walls were lined by deep eosinophilic hyaline membranes (figure 1). The identity of these cells as macrophages was confirmed by CD68 staining (figure 2). Changes in other tissues of macaques 2-4 were diffuse lymphoid hyperplasia and sinus histiocytosis of the tracheobronchial lymph nodes. The NP-specific RT-PCR was about 100-fold more sensitive than the polymerase-gene-based RT-PCR on the virus stock and the infected cell dilution series. Several other clinical samples were positive only by RT-PCR (table 3) . The SARS patients in cohort 4 co-infected with human metapneumovirus were mostly health-care workers from the same ward and who shared resting areas. Similarly, four SARS patients from Canada were infected with SARS-CoV and human metapneumovirus. 5 The clinical symptoms of human metapneumovirus infection vary from mild upper-respiratory-tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. 3, 7, 8 Based on expression of CD68 and pan-keratin, the syncytia were of histiocytic origin in macaques (this study), and of histiocytic or epithelial origin in SARS patients. 8 The formation of syncytia in these macaques may have been induced by SARS-CoV infection, because some syncytia were positive for SARS-CoV by immunohistochemistry, and the spike protein of coronavirus induces cell to cell fusion. These findings correspond to the detection of coronavirus-like particles in pneumocytes of a postmortem lung sample of a SARS patient, 8 and with the tropism of respiratory coronaviruses in pigs and rats for respiratory epithelium, and occasionally alveolar macrophages. 29 Based on these findings, together with the leucopenia observed in SARS patients, [2] [3] [4] [5] we speculate that SARS-CoV infection suppresses immunity and may predispose infected hosts to secondary infections, such as in measles virus infection. 11 The sporadic detection by RT-PCR of SARS-CoV in the urinary bladder, stomach, duodenum, cerebrum, and spleen in infected macaques in the absence of evidence of viral replication-based on virus culture or immunohistochemistry-suggests overspill from other tissues, for example via blood. 20 Collectively, these results of laboratory studies of SARS patients and experimental infections of macaques prove that the newly discovered SARS-CoV is the primary causal agent of SARS. Based on histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of postmortem tissues of these macaques, SARS-CoV infection primarily affects epithelium of the lower respiratory tract, with potentially severe consequences for respiratory function. T Kuiken and R A M Fouchier participated in the joint planning and coordination of the study. D van Riel and J D Laman were involved in the design, execution, and assessment of the immunohistochemistry test to detect SARS-CoV in tissues. T de Jong did the electron microscopy and detected SARS-CoV in pneumocytes. A D M E Osterhaus was the principal investigator and was responsible for the overall planning and coordination of the study. All other researchers were involved in the development, application, assessment of diagnostic tests on samples from SARS patients, or a combination of these."

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.
 We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.
 Findings The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.
 Interpretation 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.","Viruses of the family Coronaviridae possess a singlestrand, positive-sense RNA genome ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length. 1 Coronaviruses have been identified in several avian hosts, 2,3 as well as in various mammals, including camels, bats, masked palm civets, mice, dogs, and cats. Novel mammalian coronaviruses are now regularly identified. 1 For example, an HKU2related coronavirus of bat origin was responsible for a fatal acute diarrhoea syndrome in pigs in 2018. 4 for 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection and 858 fatalities since September, 2012, including 38 deaths following a single introduction into South Korea. 8, 9 In late December, 2019, several patients with viral pneumonia were found to be epidemiologically associated with the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China, where a number of non-aquatic animals such as birds and rabbits were also on sale before the outbreak. A novel, human-infecting coronavirus, 10, 11 provisionally named 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV), was identified with use of next-generation sequencing. As of Jan 28, 2020, China has reported more than 5900 confirmed and more than 9000 suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection across 33 Chinese provinces or municipalities, with 106 fatalities. In addition, 2019-nCoV has now been reported in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and the USA. Infections in medical workers and family clusters were also reported and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. 12 Most of the infected patients had a high fever and some had dyspnoea, with chest radiographs revealing invasive lesions in both lungs. 12, 13 We report the epidemiological data of nine inpatients, from at least three hospitals in Wuhan, who were diagnosed with viral pneumonia of unidentified cause. Using next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples and cultured isolates from these patients, 2019-nCoV was found. We describe the genomic characterisation of ten genomes of this novel virus, providing important information on the origins and cell receptor binding of the virus.
 Nine patients with viral pneumonia and negative for common respiratory pathogens, who presented to at least three hospitals in Wuhan, were included in this study. Eight of the patients had visited the Huanan seafood market before the onset of illness, and one patient (WH04) did not visit the market but stayed in a hotel near the market between Dec 23 and Dec 27, 2019 (table) . Five of the patients (WH19001, WH19002, WH19004, WH19008, and YS8011) had samples collected by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which were tested for 18 viruses and four bacteria using the RespiFinderSmart22 Kit (PathoFinder, Maastricht, Netherlands) on the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR system (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Presence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was tested using a previously reported method. 14 All five CDC samples were negative for all common respiratory pathogens screened for. Four of the patients (WH01, WH02, WH03, and WH04) had samples collected by BGI (Beijing, China), and were tested for five viruses and one bacterium using the RespiPathogen 6 Kit (Jiangsu Macro & Micro Test, Nantong, China) on the Applied Biosystems ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR system (ThermoFisher Scientific, Foster City, CA, USA). All four samples were negative for the targeted respiratory pathogens.
 Special-pathogen-free human airway epithelial (HAE) cells were used for virus isolation. Briefly, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids or throat swabs from the patients were inoculated into the HAE cells through the apical surfaces. HAE cells were maintained in an air-liquid interface incubated at 37°C. The cells were monitored daily for cytopathic effects by light microscopy and the cell supernatants were collected for use in quantitative RT-PCR assays. After three passages, apical samples were collected for sequencing.
 Evidence before this study The causal agent of an outbreak of severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China, is a novel coronavirus, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The first cases were reported in December, 2019.
 We have described the genomic characteristics of 2019-nCoV and similarities and differences to other coronaviruses, including the virus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2002-03. Genome sequences of 2019-nCoV sampled from nine patients who were among the early cases of this severe infection are almost genetically identical, which suggests very recent emergence of this virus in humans and that the outbreak was detected relatively rapidly. 2019-nCoV is most closely related to other betacoronaviruses of bat origin, indicating that these animals are the likely reservoir hosts for this emerging viral pathogen.
 By documenting the presence of 2019-nCoV in a sample of patients, our study extends previous evidence that this virus has led to the novel pneumonia that has caused severe disease in Wuhan and other geographical localities. Currently available data suggest that 2019-nCoV infected the human population from a bat reservoir, although it remains unclear if a currently unknown animal species acted as an intermediate host between bats and humans.
 reverse-transcribed into cDNA, followed by the secondstrand synthesis. Using the synthetic double-stranded DNA, a DNA library was constructed through DNAfragmentation, end-repair, adaptor-ligation, and PCR amplification. The constructed library was qualified with an Invitrogen Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher, Foster City, CA, USA), and the qualified double-stranded DNA library was transformed into a single-stranded circular DNA library through DNA-denaturation and circularisation. DNA nanoballs were generated from singlestranded circular DNA by rolling circle amplification, then qualified with Qubit 2.0 and loaded onto the flow cell and sequenced with PE100 on the DNBSEQ-T7 platform (MGI, Shenzhen, China).
 After removing adapter, low-quality, and low-complexity reads, high-quality genome sequencing data were generated. Sequence reads were first filtered against the human reference genome (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment. 15 The remaining data were then aligned to the local nucleotide database (using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment) and non-redundant protein database (using RapSearch), 16 downloaded from the US National Center for Biotechnology Information website, which contain only coronaviruses that have been published. Finally, the mapped reads were assembled with SPAdes 17 to obtain a high-quality coronavirus genome sequence.
 Primers were designed with use of OLIGO Primer Analysis Software version 6.44 on the basis of the assembled partial genome, and were verified by Primer-Blast (for more details on primer sequencs used please contact the corresponding author). PCR was set up as follows: 4·5 μL of 10X buffer, 4 μL of dNTP mix (2·5 μmol/L), 1 μL of each primer (10 μmol/L), and 0·75 units of HS Ex Taq (Takara Biomedical Technology, Beijing, China), in a total volume of 30 μL. The cDNAs reverse transcribed from clinical samples were used as templates, and random primers were used. The following program was run on the thermocycler: 95°C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min as determined by product size; 72°C for 7 min; and a 4°C hold. Finally, the PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and products of the expected size were sequenced from both ends on the Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA Analyzer platform (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA; for more details on expected size please contact the corresponding author).
 The whole-genome sequences of 2019-nCoV from six samples (WH19001, WH19005, WH19002, WH19004, WH19008, and YS8011) were generated by a combination Sanger, Illumina, and Oxford nanopore sequencing. First, viral RNAs were extracted directly from clinical samples with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and then used to synthesise cDNA with the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and N6 random primers, followed by second-strand synthesis with DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment (ThermoFisher). Viral cDNA libraries were prepared with use of the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), then purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), followed by quantification with an Invitrogen Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. The resulting DNA libraries were sequenced on either the MiSeq or iSeq platforms (Illumina) using a 300-cycle reagent kit. About 1·2-5 GB of data were obtained for each sample.
 The raw fastQ files for each virus sample were filtered using previously described criteria, 18 then subjected to de novo assembly with the CLCBio software version 11.0.1. Mapped assemblies were also done using the batderived SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 (accession number MG772933.1) as a reference. Variant calling, genome alignments, and sequence illustrations were generated with CLCBio software, and the assembled genome sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was done to obtain the sequences of the 5ʹ and 3ʹ termini, using the Invitrogen 5ʹ RACE System and 3ʹ RACE System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene-specific primers (appendix p 1) for 5ʹ and 3ʹ RACE PCR amplification were designed to obtain a fragment of approximately 400-500 bp for the two regions. Purified PCR products were cloned into the pMD18-T Simple Vector (TaKaRa, Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) and chemically com petent Escherichia coli (DH5α cells; TaKaRa), according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were sequenced with use of M13 forward and reverse primers.
 Reference virus genomes were obtained from GenBank using Blastn with 2019-nCoV as a query. The open reading frames of the verified genome sequences were predicted using Geneious (version 11.1.5) and annotated using the Conserved Domain Database. 19 Pairwise sequence identities were also calculated using Geneious. Potential genetic recombination was investigated using SimPlot software (version 3.5.1) 20 and phylogenetic analysis.
 Sequence alignment of 2019-nCoV with reference sequences was done with Mafft software (version 7.450). 21 Phylogenetic analyses of the complete genome and major coding regions were done with RAxML software (version 8.2.9) 22 with 1000 bootstrap replicates, employing the general time reversible nucleotide substitution model.
 On the basis of the genome sequences obtained, a real-time PCR detection assay was developed. PCR primers and probes were designed using Applied Biosystems Primer Express Software (ThermoFisher Scientific, Foster City, CA, USA) on the basis of our sequenced virus genomes. The specific primers and probe set (labelled with the reporter 6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM] and the quencher Black Hole Quencher 1 [BHQ1]) for orf1a were as follows: for ward primer 5ʹ-AGAAGATTGGTTAGATGATGATAGT-3ʹ; re verse pri mer 5ʹ-TTCCATCTCTAATTGAGGTTGAACC-3ʹ; and probe 5ʹ-FAM-TCCTCACTGCCGTCTTGTTG ACCA-BHQ1-3ʹ. The human GAPDH gene was used as an internal con trol (forward primer 5ʹ-TCAAGAA GGTGGTGAAGCAGG-3ʹ; reverse primer 5ʹ-CAGCGTC AAA GGTG GAGGAGT-3ʹ; probe 5ʹ-VIC-CCT CAA GGG CATCC TGGG CTACACT-BHQ1-3ʹ). Primers and probes were synthesised by BGI (Beijing, China). RT-PCR was done with an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo-Scientific), with 30 µL reaction volumes consisting of 14 µL of diluted RNA, 15 µL of 2X Taqman One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix Reagents (4309169; Applied Biosystems, ThermoFisher), 0·5 µL of 40X MultiScribe and RNase inhibitor mixture, 0·75 μL forward primer (10 μmol/L), 0·75 μL reverse primer (10 μmol/L), and 0·375 μL probe (10 μmol/L). Thermal cycling parameters were 30 min at 42°C, followed by 10 min at 95°C, and a subsequent 40 cycles of amplification (95°C for 15 s and 58°C for 45 s). Fluorescence was recorded during the 58°C phase.
 The funder of the study had no role in data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of report. GFG and WS had access to all the data in the study, and GFG, WS, WT, WC, and GW were responsible for the decision to submit for publication.
 From the nine patients' samples analysed, eight complete and two partial genome sequences of 2019-nCoV were obtained. These data have been deposited in the China National Microbiological Data Center (accession number NMDC10013002 and genome accession numbers NMDC60013002-01 to NMDC60013002-10) and the data from BGI have been deposited in the China National GeneBank (acces sion numbers CNA0007332-35).
 Based on these genomes, we developed a real-time PCR assay and tested the original clinical samples from the BGI (WH01, WH02, WH03, and WH04) again to determine their threshold cycle (Ct) values (table) . The remaining samples were tested by a different real-time PCR assay developed by the Chinese CDC, with Ct values ranging from 22·85 to 32·41 (table) . These results confirmed the presence of 2019-nCoV in the patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples or cultured viruses of nine patients were used for next-generation sequencing. After removing host (human) reads, de novo assembly was done and the contigs obtained used as queries to search the non-redundant protein database. Some contigs identified in all the samples were closely related to the bat SARS-like betacoronavirus bat-SL-CoVZC45 betacoronavirus. 23 Bat-SL-CoVZC45 was then used as the reference genome and reads from each pool were mapped to it, generating consensus sequences corresponding to all the pools. These consensus sequences were then used as new reference genomes. Eight complete genomes and two partial genomes (from samples WH19002 and WH02; table) were obtained. The de novo assembly of the clean reads from all the pools did not identify any other long contigs that corresponded to other viruses at high abundance.
 The eight complete genomes were nearly identical across the whole genome, with sequence identity above 99·98%, indicative of a very recent emergence into the human population ( figure 1A) . The largest nucleotide difference was four mutations. Notably, the sequence identity between the two virus genomes from the same patient (WH19001, from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and WH19005, from cell culture) was more than 99·99%,

 3' Base pairs with 100% identity at the amino acid level. In addition, the partial genomes from samples WH02 and WH19002 also had nearly 100% identity to the complete genomes across the aligned gene regions. A Blastn search of the complete genomes of 2019-nCoV revealed that the most closely related viruses available on GenBank were bat-SL-CoVZC45 (sequence identity 87·99%; query coverage 99%) and another SARS-like betacoronavirus of bat origin, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (accession number MG772934; 23 87·23%; query coverage 98%). In five gene regions (E, M, 7, N, and 14) , the sequence identities were greater than 90%, with the highest being 98·7% in the E gene ( figure 2A) . The S gene of 2019-nCoV exhibited the lowest sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, at only around 75%. In addition, the sequence identity in 1b (about 86%) was lower than that in 1a (about 90%; figure 2A) . Most of the encoded proteins exhibited high sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and the related bat-derived coronaviruses ( figure 2a) . The notable exception was the spike protein, with only around 80% sequence identity, and protein 13, with 73·2% sequence identity. Notably, the 2019-nCoV strains were less genetically similar to SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). The similarity between 2019-nCoV and related viruses was visualised using SimPlot software, with the 2019-nCoV consensus sequence employed as the query ( figure 2B) .
 Comparison of the predicted coding regions of 2019-nCoV showed that they possessed a similar genomic organisation to bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and SARS-CoV Phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV and its closely related reference genomes, as well as representative betacoronaviruses, revealed that the five subgenera formed five well supported branches ( figure 3) . The subgenus Sarbecovirus could be classified into three well supported clades: two SARS-CoV-related strains from Rhinolophus sp from Bulgaria (accession number GU190215) and Kenya (KY352407) formed clade 1; the ten 2019-nCoV from Wuhan and the two bat-derived SARS-like strains from Zhoushan in eastern China (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) formed clade 2, which was notable for the long branch separating the human and bat viruses; and SARS-CoV strains from humans and many genetically similar SARS-like corona viruses from bats collected from southwestern China formed clade 3, with bat-derived coronaviruses also falling in the basal positions ( figure 3 ). In addition, 2019-nCoV was distinct from SARS-CoV in a phylogeny of the complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (appendix p 2). This evidence indicates that 2019-nCoV is a novel beta coronavirus from the subgenus Sarbecovirus.
 As the sequence similarity plot revealed changes in genetic distances among viruses across the 2019-nCoV genome, we did additional phylogenetic analyses of the major encoding regions of representative members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus. Consistent with the genome phylogeny, 2019-nCoV, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 clustered together in trees of the 1a and spike genes (appendix p 3). By contrast, 2019-nCoV did not cluster with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 in the 1b tree, but instead formed a distinct clade with SARS-CoV, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (appendix p 3), indicative of potential recombination events in 1b, although these probably occurred in the bat coronaviruses rather than 2019-nCoV. Phylogenetic analysis of the 2019-nCoV genome excluding 1b revealed similar evolutionary relationships as the full-length viral genome (appendix p 3).
 The envelope spike (S) protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion 24 and is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity. 25, 26 Generally, the spike protein of coronaviruses is functionally divided into the S1 domain (especially positions 318-510 of SARS-CoV), responsible for receptor binding, and the S2 domain, responsible for cell membrane fusion. 27 The 2019-nCoV S2 protein showed around 93% sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21-much higher than that of the S1 domain, which had only around 68% identity with these bat-derived viruses. Both the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of the S1 domain can bind to host receptors. 28 We inspected amino acid variation in the spike protein among the Sarbecovirus coronaviruses The receptor-binding domain of betacoronaviruses, which directly engages the receptor, is commonly located in the C-terminal domain of S1, as in SARS-CoV 29 for lineage B, and MERS-CoV 30,31 and BatCoV HKU4, 32 for lineage C (figure 5). Through phylogenetic analysis of the receptor-binding domain of four different lineages of betacoronaviruses (appendix p 4), we found that, although 2019-nCoV was closer to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 at the whole-genome level, the receptor-binding domain of 2019-nCoV fell within lineage B and was closer to that of SARS-CoV (figure 5A). The three-dimensional structure of 2019-nCoV receptorbinding domain was modelled using the Swiss-Model program 33 with the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain structure (Protein Data Bank ID 2DD8) 34 as a template. This analysis suggested that, like other betacoronaviruses, the receptor-binding domain was composed of a core and an external subdomain ( figure 5B-D) .
 Notably, the external subdomain of the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain was more similar to that of SARS-CoV. This result suggests that 2019-nCoV might also use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor. However, we also observed that several key residues responsible for the binding of the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain to the ACE2 receptor were variable in the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain (including Asn439, Asn501, Gln493, Gly485 and Phe486; 2019-nCoV numbering).
 From genomic surveillance of clinical samples from patients with viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, a novel coronavirus (termed 2019-nCoV) has been identified. 10, 11 Our phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV, sequenced from nine patients' samples, showed that the virus belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus. 2019-nCoV was more similar to two bat-derived coronavirus strains, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, than to known human-infecting coronaviruses, including the virus that caused the SARS outbreak of 2003.
 Epidemiologically, eight of the nine patients in our study had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, suggesting that they might have been in close contact with the infection source at the market. However, one patient had never visited the market, although he had stayed in a hotel near the market before the onset of their illness. This finding suggests either possible droplet transmission or that the patient was infected by a currently unknown source. Evidence of clusters of infected family members and medical workers has now confirmed the presence of human-to-human transmission. 12 Clearly, this infection is a major public health concern, particularly as this outbreak coincides with the peak of the Chinese Spring Festival travel rush, during which hundreds of millions of people will travel through China. As a typical RNA virus, the average evolutionary rate for coronaviruses is roughly 10 -⁴ nucleotide substitutions per site per year, 1 with mutations arising during every replication cycle. It is, therefore, striking that the sequences of 2019-nCoV from different patients described here were almost identical, with greater than 99·9% sequence identity. This finding suggests that 2019-nCoV originated from one source within a very short period and was detected relatively rapidly. However, as the virus transmits to more individuals, constant surveillance of mutations arising is needed.
 Phylogenetic analysis showed that bat-derived coronaviruses fell within all five subgenera of the genus Betacoronavirus. Moreover, bat-derived coronaviruses fell in basal positions in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, with 2019-nCoV most closely related to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, which were also sampled from bats. 23 These data are consistent with a bat reservoir for coronaviruses in general and for 2019-nCoV in particular. However, despite the importance of bats, several facts suggest that another animal is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans. First, the outbreak was first reported in late December, 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%, which is reflected in the relatively long branch between them. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV. Fourth, in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, bats acted as the natural reservoir, with another animal (masked palm civet for SARS-CoV 35 and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV) 36 acting as an intermediate host, with humans as terminal hosts. Therefore, on the basis of current data, it seems likely that the 2019-nCoV causing the Wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats, and might have been transmitted to humans via currently unknown wild animal(s) sold at the Huanan seafood market.
 Previous studies have uncovered several receptors that different coronaviruses bind to, such as ACE2 for SARS-CoV 29 and CD26 for MERS-CoV. 30 Our molecular modelling showed structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. Therefore, we suggest that 2019-nCoV might use ACE2 as the receptor, despite the presence of amino acid mutations in the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain. Although a previous study using HeLa cells expressing ACE2 proteins showed that 2019-nCoV could employ the ACE2 receptor, 37 whether these mutations affect ACE2 binding or change receptor tropism requires further study.
 Recombination has been seen frequently in coronaviruses. 1 As expected, we detected recombination in the Sarbecoviruses analysed here. Our results suggest that recombination events are complex and are more likely occurring in bat coronaviruses than in 2019-nCoV. Hence, despite its occurrence, recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus, although this inference might change if more closely related animal viruses are identified.
 In conclusion, we have described the genomic structure of a seventh human coronavirus that can cause severe pneumonia and have shed light on its origin and

China is sometimes perceived as working alone and insuffi ciently cooperating with other countries. Is China's engagement distinctive or similar to other countries? China, similar to most countries, has no single offi cial source of data for global health because of the multiplicity of governmental stakeholders, the absence of a national strategy on global health, and the unclear borderline between aid and trade investments. 4 A study 5 by NYU's Wagner School has estimated China's foreign aid to Africa, Latin America, and southeast Asia from 2002 to 2007. Strange and coauthors 6 estimated all previous estimates of Chinese development fi nance to Africa. All data sources are shown in the appendix. The Chinese Government is essentially the only source of information, without other sources of independent verifi cation. Reports of classifi cation and nomenclature often do not follow international standards. A common limitation is the mixing of stock data versus fl ow data. Matching and piecing together the fragments allows inconsistencies to be double checked for consistency. China's participation in global health has deep historical roots, not only just in recent years. 9 In the 20th century, some Chinese health crises such as the Manchurian plague epidemic captured the attention of neighbouring countries of the international community. First, health aid aims to advance global health equity. On the basis of this framework, China's modern timeline might be demarcated by fi ve landmarks. First, in 1963, China sent its fi rst overseas medical team to Algeria, followed 6 years later by the donation of its fi rst hospital in Tanzania. Finally, and perhaps most dramatically, the 2003 severe acute repiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic underscored both China's neglect of its health sector and the reality that China's global trade cannot be done without mutual health protection. The 2011 white paper reports foreign aid of US$37·6 billion accumulated up to and including 2009 in three categories: grants of $15·6 billion; concessional loans of $10·8 billion; and interest-free loans of $11·2 billion. The largest share of health aid is spent on medical teams and donated facilities. Understanding of the type of health support off ered rather than the precise volume of funding might be more important. Since 1963, under the protocol on the dispatch of medical teams signed between the government of China and the recipient countries, about 23 000 Chinese medical workers have been sent to about 66 countries to provide services to an estimated 270 million people. Most workers are clinicians, and most teams include a leader and a translator. Public health skills are usually not included. The average duration of an overseas assignment is 2 years, with team members receiving housing and food plus enhanced salaries. Over the period of 2010-12, these medical teams working in 54 countries had provided about 7 million medical consultations and treatments. African countries were the recipients of more than three-quarters of the donated facilities. Although most countries have received at least one facility, some have received up to 6. Malaria control has recently been prioritised. A comprehensive analysis of this question would need access to data not currently available. Regression analysis of African countries with variables of health aid (medical teams, donated facilities, malaria control) and economic interests (petroleum imports, China's foreign investment, and China's imports and exports) yielded no signifi cant pattern. The scatter-plots did not show any association between medical aid and economic interests. For China, the 2003 SARS epidemic was a crisis with serious economic and political consequences. Both disease control and international cooperation were delayed. 33] [34] [35] Infections can move in several directions. In 2011, a polio epidemic was imported from Pakistan into China's Xinjiang province. These concerns might be why China has upgraded its State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) to the status of a ministry with larger budget, increased staff , and stronger regulatory powers. Air pollutants in China have been cited as causing acid rain damage to forests in Korea and Japan. 49 Its implementation deserves tracking for monitoring and evaluation of control eff ect. Knowledge is both local and global, and its production, ownership, exchange, and application have global dimensions. China has much to share with and much to learn from the rest of the world. The three decades after the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 witnessed some of the steepest advances of mortality control in human history. For both teams, their primary role was to provide clinical care to patients. But a professor of Chinese traditional medicine from Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine is leading an unprecedented eff ort to eradicate malaria on the Comoros Islands with traditional Chinese medicine. Strikingly, China's investments since 2007 have increased annually at 33% in comparison, for example, to −2% for the USA. 60 China, moreover, houses laboratories for most of the major pharmaceutical companies. 34 China is also a growing producer and exporter of generic products. China's medical universities are increasingly undertaking research and education in global health. In 2010-12, the government provided 76 845 scholarships for such programmes, of which many were health related. Although foreign interest in traditional medicine is high, most foreign students register for modern medicine. 68 China's health aid is embedded in the dynamic shifting of foreign and economic policies. 69, 70 These are all defi ning characteristics of China's engagement in global health. Health has been assigned a lower position than political and commercial aff airs. As a result, improved interministerial coordination is a necessary development for the evolution of a coherent overall engagement in global health. Formulation of a China global health strategy could help bring coherent policy and harmonised action, because it would compel the articulation of specifi c health and humanitarian objectives in Chinese governmental policies. How important China will become as a major donor to these pooled funds is uncertain. Some see the early actions as symbolic gestures of cofunding, whereas others hope that the size of the Chinese economy will propel it to become a fi nancial leader of multilateral funds. The New Development Bank being established by BRICS countries aims to compete with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which is one example of how China has debatably played a leadership role. 72 Most important is the avoidance of over-simplifi cation. 74,75 Although China's health aid is generally appreciated by recipient offi cial statements, there are indeed complaints about the scale of China's intrusion, access to natural resources, and the trade market in Africa. Chinese driving forces are undoubtedly several and complex-political, economic, social, and humanitarian."

Since then, several strains, including influenza A H5N1, H1N1, H7N9, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV have emerged from animal populations causing considerable disease and mortality 3 . While public health measures silenced the SARS-CoV outbreak 2 , recent metagenomics studies have identified sequences of closely related SARS-like viruses circulating in Chinese bat populations that may pose a future threat 4, 5 . However, sequence data alone provides minimal insights to identify and prepare for future pre-pandemic viruses. Therefore, to examine emergence potential of circulating CoVs, we built a chimeric virus that encodes a novel, zoonotic spike protein in the context of a viable CoV backbone. This approach characterized the threat posed by SHC014-CoV spike in primary human airway cells, in vivo, as well as the efficacy of available immune therapeutics. Together, the strategy translates metagenomics data to help predict and prepare for future emergent viruses.
 SHC014 and WIV1 sequences represent the closest relatives to the epidemic SARS-CoV strains ( Fig. 1 a,b) , but maintain important differences in the 14 residues that bind human ACE2, including the five critical for host range: Y442, L472, N479, T487, and Y491 6 . In WIV1, three of these residues vary from SARS-CoV Urbani, but were not expected to alter binding ( Supplementary Fig. 1a , b, Supplementary Table 1 ). This fact is confirmed by both pseudotyping experiments ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ) and in vitro replication of WIV1-CoV 5 . In contrast, seven of the 14 ACE2 interaction residues in SHC014 are different than SARS-CoV, including all five critical residues ( Supplementary Fig. 1c , Supplementary Table 1) . These changes, coupled with failure of pseudotyping ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ), suggested that SHC014 spike is unable to bind human ACE2. However, similar changes had been reported to convey ACE2 binding in related SARS-CoV strains 6, 7 and thus suggested functional testing was required for verification. Therefore, we synthesized the SHC014 spike in the context of the replication competent, mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone (SHC014-MA15) ( Supplementary Fig. 2a ). Despite predictions from both structure-based modeling and pseudotyping experiments, SHC014-MA15 was viable and replicated to high titers in Vero cells (Supplementary Fig. 2b ). Similar to SARS, SHC014-MA15 also required a functional ACE2 molecule for entry, but uses human, civet, and bat orthologs ( Supplementary Fig. 2c, d) . To test the ability of SHC014 spike to mediate infection of the human airway, we examined 2B4 Calu-3 cells, a human epithelial airway cell line 8 , and found robust SHC014-MA15 replication comparable to SARS-CoV Urbani (Fig. 1c) . To extend these findings, primary human airway epithelial cultures (HAEs) were infected and indicated robust replication of both viruses (Fig. 1d) . Together, the data confirm the ability of SHC014 spike to infect human airway cells and underscore the threat of cross-species transmission.
 We next evaluated in vivo infection of 10-week old BALB/c mice with 10 4 plaque-forming units (PFU) of either SARS-MA15 or SHC014-MA15 ( Fig. 1e-h) . Animals infected with SARS-MA15 experienced rapid weight loss and lethality by four days post infection (DPI); in contrast, SHC014-MA15 produced substantial weight loss (10%), but no lethality (Fig.  1e) . Examination of viral replication revealed nearly equivalent titers from lungs of mice infected with SARS-MA15 and SHC014-MA15 (Fig. 1f) . While SARS-CoV MA15 produced robust staining in both the terminal bronchioles and the lung parenchyma 2 DPI (Fig. 1g ), SHC014-MA15 had a deficit in airway antigen staining (Fig. 1h) . In contrast, no equivalent deficit was observed in the parenchyma or overall histology scoring, suggesting differential infection following SHC014-MA15 (Supplementary Table 2 ). Shifting to more susceptible aged animals, SARS-MA15 infected animals rapidly lost weight and succumb to infection ( Supplementary Fig. 3 a, b) ; SHC014-MA15 induced robust and sustained weight loss, but had minimal lethality. Histology and antigen staining trends observed in young mice were conserved in the older animals (Supplementary Table 3 ). We excluded use of an alterative receptor based on Ace2 −/− mice infection, which did not produce weight loss or antigen staining following SHC014-MA15 infection ( Supplementary Fig. 4a , b; Supplementary Table 2 ). Together, the data indicate that viruses utilizing SHC014 spike are capable of inducing considerable disease in mice in the context of a virulent CoV backbone.
 Given the efficacy of Ebola monoclonal antibody therapies like ZMApp 9 , we next sought to determine the efficacy of SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies against SHC014-MA15. Four broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies had been previously reported and are likely reagents for immunotherapy [10] [11] [12] . Examining percent inhibition, wild-type SARS-CoV Urbani was strongly neutralized by all four antibodies at relatively low antibody concentrations ( Fig. 2a-d) . In contrast, neutralization varied for SHC014-MA15. Fm6, an antibody generated by phage display and escape mutants 10, 11 , achieved only background levels of inhibition of SHC014-MA15 (Fig. 2a) . Similarly, antibodies 230.15 and 227.14, derived from memory B cells of SARS-CoV infected patients 12 , also failed to block SHC014-MA15 (Fig. 2b, c) . For all three antibodies, differences between SARS and SHC014 spikes corresponded to direct or adjacent residue changes found in escape mutants (fm6 -N479R; 230.15 -L443V; 227.14-K390). Finally, monoclonal antibody 109.8 was able to achieve 50% neutralization of SHC014-MA15, but only at very high concentrations (Fig. 2d) . Together, the results demonstrate that despite the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV, these reagents may only have marginal efficacy against emergent SARS-like CoV strains like SHC014.
 To evaluate existing vaccines against SHC014-MA15, aged mice were vaccinated with double-inactivated whole SARS-CoV (DIV). Previously, DIV had shown neutralization and protection from homologous virus challenge 13 , but vaccine failure and augmented immune pathology in aged animals indicated a possibility for harm due to vaccination 14 . In this study, DIV provided no protection from SHC014-MA15 in regards to weight loss or viral titer ( Supplementary Fig. 5a, b) . Consistent with previous reports 14 , serum from DIVvaccinated aged mice also failed to neutralize SHC014-MA15 ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ).
 Perhaps most importantly, DIV vaccination resulted in robust immune pathology (Supplementary Table 4 ) and eosinophilia ( Supplementary Fig. 5d-f ). Together, these results confirm DIV vaccine failure and illustrated augmented disease for the aged vaccinated group.
 In contrast to DIV, SHC014-MA15 challenge as a vaccine showed promise, but with important caveats. Utilizing a high dose, we infected young mice with SHC014-MA15 and followed over 28-days; the mice were subsequently challenged with SARS-MA15 ( Supplementary Fig. 6a ). Prior high-dose infection with SHC014-MA15 conferred protection against lethal SARS-MA15 challenge, but only minimal SARS-CoV neutralization response from SHC014-MA15 antisera ( Supplementary Fig. 6b , 1/200) implying diminished protection over time. Similar results were observed in aged BALB/C mice in terms of weight loss and viral replication ( Supplementary Fig. 6c, d) . However, this infection dose induced > 10% weight loss and lethality in some aged animals ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Using low-dose infection, SHC014-MA15 failed to protect aged animals from lethal SARS-CoV challenge ( Supplementary Fig. 6e , f). Together, the data suggest that SHC014-MA15 challenge can confer cross-protection against SARS-CoV through conserved epitopes, but requires a dose that induces pathogenesis.
 Having established SHC014 spike as a potential threat, we next synthesized a full-length SHC014-CoV infectious clone based on the approach used for SARS-CoV (Fig. 3a) 15 . Replication in Vero cells revealed no deficit for SHC014-CoV relative to SARS-CoV (Fig.  3b) ; however, SHC014-CoV was significantly (p < 0.01) attenuated in primary human airway epithelial cultures at both 24 and 48 hours post infection (Fig. 3c) . In vivo infection demonstrated no significant weight loss, but defined reduced viral replication for full length SHC014-CoV infection compared to SARS-CoV Urbani (Fig. 3d, e) . Together, the results establish the viability of full length SHC014-CoV, but suggest further adaptation is required to be equivalent to epidemic SARS-CoV replication in human respiratory cells and in mice.
 During the SARS-CoV epidemic, links were quickly established between palm civets and coronavirus strains detected in humans 2 . Building upon this finding, the common emergence paradigm argued that epidemic SARS-CoV originated as a bat virus, jumped to civets, and incorporated changes within the RBD to improve binding to civet Ace2 16 . Subsequent exposure to humans in live markets permitted infection with the civet strain, which, in turn, adapted to become the epidemic strain (Fig. 4a) . However, phylogenetic analysis suggested that early human SARS strains appear more closely related to bat than civet strains 16 . Therefore, a second paradigm argued that direct bat-human transmission initiated SARS-CoV emergence, with palm civets serving as a secondary host and reservoir for continued infection (Fig. 4b, 17 ). For both paradigms, spike adaptation in a secondary host is seen as a necessity, with most mutations expected within the RBD and facilitating improved infection. Both theories imply that pools of bat CoVs are limited and host range mutations are both random and rare, reducing the likelihood of future emergence events in humans.
 While not invalidating the other emergence routes, the current study argues for a third paradigm in which circulating bat CoV pools maintain ""poised"" spike proteins capable of infecting humans without mutation or adaptation (Fig. 4c) . Illustrated with SHC014 spike in the SARS-CoV backbone, robust infection occurs in both human airway cultures and in vivo without RBD adaptation. Coupled with previous identification of pathogenic CoV backbones 1,18 , the results suggest that the starting materials required for SARS-like emergent strains are currently circulating in animal reservoirs. Importantly, while full-length SHC014-CoV likely requires additional backbone adaption to mediate human disease, the documented high frequency recombination events in CoV families underscores the possibility of future emergence and the need for further preparation.
 To date, genomics screens of animal populations have primarily been used to identify novel viruses in outbreak settings 19 . The approach in this manuscript extends these datasets to examine questions of emergence and therapeutic efficacy. For the SHC014 spike, we define a threat due to replication in primary human airway cultures, the best available model for human disease. In addition, pathogenesis in mice indicates a capacity to cause disease in mammalian models without RBD adaptation. Notably, differential tropism in the lung and attenuation of full-length SHC014-CoV in HAE cultures suggest factors beyond ACE2 binding may contribute to emergence including spike processivity, receptor bio-availability, or antagonism of the host immune responses. However, further testing in non-human primates is required to translate these finding into pathogenic potential in humans. Importantly, the failure of available therapeutics defines a critical need for further study and treatment development. With this knowledge, surveillance programs, diagnostic reagents, and effective treatments can be produced to protect from emergence of group 2b specific CoVs like SHC014 as well as other CoV branches that maintain similar heterogeneous pools.
 While offering preparation against future emerging viruses, this approach must be considered in the context of the US government-mandated pause on gain of function (GOF) studies 20 . Based on previous models of emergence (Fig. 4a, b) , the creation of chimeric viruses like SHC014-MA15 was not expected to increase pathogenicity. However, while SHC014-MA15 is attenuated relative to parental mouse adapted, equivalent studies examining the wild-type Urbani spike within the MA15 backbone produced no weight loss and replication attenuation 21 . As such, relative to the Urbani Spike-MA15 CoV, SHC014-MA15 constitutes a gain in pathogenesis (Fig. 1 ). Based on these findings, review panels may deem similar studies too risky to pursue as increased pathogenicity in mammalian models cannot be excluded. Coupled with restrictions on mouse adapted strains and monoclonal antibodies generated against escape mutants, research into CoV emergence and therapeutic efficacy may be severely limited moving forward. Together, these data and restrictions represent a crossroads of GOF research concerns; the potential to prepare and mitigate future outbreaks must be weighed against the risk of creating more dangerous pathogens. In developing policies moving forward, it is important to consider the value of the data generated by these studies and if they warrant further study or the inherent risks involved.
 Overall, our approach has used metagenomics data to identify a threat posed by circulating bat SARS-like CoV SHC014. With the ability to replicate in human airway cultures, produce in vivo pathogenesis, and escape current therapeutics, SHC014 chimeric viruses illustrate the need for both surveillance and improved therapeutics against circulating SARS-like viruses. The approach also unlocks metagenomics data to predict viral emergence with possible applications for preparing to treat future emerging virus infections.
 Viruses, Cells, In Vitro Infection, and Plaque Assays. Wild-type SARS-CoV (Urbani), mouse adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) and chimeric SARS-like CoVs were cultured on Vero E6 cells, grown in DMEM (Gibco, CA) and 5% Fetal Clone Serum (Hyclone, South Logan, UT) along with anti/anti (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA). DBT cells expressing ACE2 orthologs have been previously described for both human and civet; bat ACE2 sequence based on Rhinolophus leschenaulti and established as described previously 22 . Pseudotyping experiments were based on HIV-based pseudovirus prepared as previously described 23 and examined on HeLa cells expressing ACE2 orthologs grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco) as previously described 24 . Growth curves in Vero, DBT, Calu-3 2B4, and primary human airway epithelial cells were performed as previously described 22, 25 . Vero E6 cells were originally obtained from USAMRIID; Calu3 cells were originally provided by Dr. CT Tseng, Universtiy of Texas Medical Branch; none of the cell line working stocks have not been recently authenticated or tested for mycoplasma, although the original seed stocks used to create the working stocks are free from contamination. Human lungs for HAE cultures were procured under University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board-approved protocols and represent highly differentiated human airway epithelium containing ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells as well as goblet cells. The cultures are also grown on an air-liquid interface for several weeks prior to use as previously described 26 . Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, and inoculated with virus or mock diluted in PBS for 40 minutes at 37 °C. Following inoculation, cells were washed 3 times, and fresh media added to signify time 0. Three or more biological replicates were harvested at each described time point. No blinding was used in any sample collections nor were samples randomized. All virus cultivation was performed in a BSL3 laboratory with redundant fans in Biosafety Cabinets as described previously by our group. All personnel wore Powdered Air Purifying Respirator (3M breathe easy) with Tyvek suits, aprons, booties and were double-gloved.
 The full-length genome sequences and S1 domains of spike amino acid sequences of representative CoVs were downloaded from Genbank or PATRIC, aligned with ClustalX, and phylogenetically compared by Maximum Likelihood using 100 bootstraps or with the PhyML package respectively. The tree was generated using Maximum Likelihood with the PhyML package. The scale bar represents nucleotide substitutions. Only nodes with bootstrap support above 70% are labeled. The tree shows that CoVs are divided into three distinct phylogenetic groups defined as α, β, and γ. Classical subgroup clusters are marked as 2a-2d for β CoVs and 1a and 1b for the α CoVs. Structural models were generated using Modeller (Max Planck Institute Bioinformatics Toolkit) to generate homology models for SHC014 and Rs3367 of the SARS RBD in complex with ACE2 based on crystal structure 2AJF (RCSB PBD identifier). Homology models were visualized and manipulated in MacPyMol (version 1.3).
 Both wild-type and chimeric viruses were derived from either SARS-CoV Urbani or corresponding mouse adapted (MA15) infectious clone as previously described 27 . Plasmids containing spike sequences for SHC014 were extracted by restriction digest and ligated into the E and F plasmid of the MA15 infectious clone. The clone was designed and purchased from Bio Basic as six contiguous cDNAs using published sequences flanked by unique class II restriction endonuclease sites (BglI). Thereafter, plasmids containing wild-type, chimeric SARS-CoV and SHC014-CoV genome fragments were amplified, excised, ligated, and purified. In vitro transcription reactions were then preformed to synthesize full-length genomic RNA, which was transfected into Vero E6 cells as previously described 28 . The media from transfected cells were harvested and served as seed stocks for subsequent experiments. Chimeric and full length viruses were confirmed by sequence analysis prior to use in these studies. Synthetic construction of chimeric mutant and full length SHC014-CoV were approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Biosafety Committee and the Dual Use Research of Concern committee.
 This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations for care and use of animals by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), National Institutes of Health. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC, Permit Number A-3410-01) approved the animal study protocol (IACUC #13-033) followed in this manuscript.
 Female 10 week and 12 month old Balb/cAnNHsD mice were ordered from the Harlan Labs. Mouse infections occurred as previously described 29 . Briefly, animals were brought into a biosafety lab level 3 and allowed to acclimate for 1 week prior to infection. For infection and live-attenuated virus vaccination, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine and infected intranasally when challenged with 50 μl of phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) or diluted virus with three to four mice per time point, per infection group per dose as described in the figure legends. For individual mice, notations for infection including failure to inhale entire dose, bubbling of inoculum from nose, or infection through the mouth may lead to exclusion of mouse data at discretion of the researcher; post-infection, no other pre-established exclusion/inclusion criteria are defined. No blinding was used in any animal experiments and animals were not randomized. For vaccination, young and aged mice were vaccinated by footpad injection with a 20 μl volume of either 0.2 μg of double-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine with alum or mock PBS; mice were then boosted with the same regimen 22 days later, and challenged 21 days thereafter. For all groups, as per protocol, animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease (hunching, ruffled fur, reduced activity) for the duration of the experiment. Weight loss was monitored daily for the first 7 days after which, weight monitoring continued until the animals recovered to their initial starting weight or displayed three continuous days of weight gain. All mice losing greater than 20% of their starting body weight were ground fed and further monitored multiple times per day as long as they were under the 20% cutoff.
 Mice losing greater than 30% of their starting body weight were immediately sacrificed as per protocol. Any mouse deemed to be moribund or unlikely to recover were also humanly sacrificed at the discretion of the researcher. Euthanasia was preformed via isoflurane overdose and confirmation of death by cervical dislocation. All mouse studies were performed at the University of North Carolina (Animal Welfare Assurance #A3410-01) using protocols approved by the UNC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
 The left lung was removed and submerged in 10% buffered formalin (Fisher) without inflation for 1 week. Tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 5 μm sections were prepared by the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center histopathology core facility. To determine the extent of antigen staining, sections were stained for viral antigen using a commercially available polyclonal SARS-CoV anti-nucleocapsid antibody (Imgenex) and scored in a blinded manner by for staining of the airway and parenchyma as previously described 29 . Images were captured using an Olympus BX41 microscope with an Olympus DP71 camera.
 Plaque reduction neutralization titer assays were performed with previously characterized antibodies against SARS-CoV as previously described [30] [31] [32] . Briefly, nAbs or serum were serially diluted 2-fold and incubated with 100 PFU of the different icSARS-CoV strains for 1 h at 37°C. The virus and antibodies were then added to a 6-well plate with 5 ×10 5 Vero E6 cells/well with N ≥ 2. After a 1-h incubation at 37°C, cells were overlaid with 3 ml of 0.8% agarose in media. Plates were incubated for two days at 37° C and then stained with neutral red for 3 hours, and plaques were counted. The percentage of plaque reduction was calculated as [1 − (no. of plaques with antibody/no. of plaques without antibody)] × 100.
 All experiments were conducted contrasting two experimental groups (either two viruses, or vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts). Therefore, significant differences in viral titer and histology scoring were determined by a two-tailed student's t test at individual time points. Data was normally distributed in each group being compared and had similar variance.
 Reported studies were initiated after the University of North Carolina Institutional Biosafety Committee approved the experimental protocol: Project Title: Generating infectious clones of Bat SARS-like CoVs; Lab Safety Plan ID: 20145741; Schedule G ID: 12279. These studies were initiated prior to the U.S. Government Deliberative Process Research Funding Pause on Selected Gain of Function Research Involving Influenza, MERS, and SARS Viruses (http://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse/Documents/gain-of-function.pdf), and the current manuscript has been reviewed by the funding agency, the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Continuation of these studies have been requested and approved by NIH.
 All work for these studies was performed with approved standard operating procedures (SOPs) and safety conditions for SARS-CoV, MERs-CoV and other related CoVs. Our institutional CoV BSL3 facilities have been designed to conform to the safety requirements recommended in Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the NIH. Laboratory safety plans have been submitted, and the facility has been approved for use by the UNC Department of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) and the CDC. Electronic card access is required for entry into the facility. All workers have been trained by EHS to safely use powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs), and appropriate work habits in a BSL3 facility and active medical surveillance plans are in place. Our CoV BSL3 facilities contain redundant fans, emergency power to fans, and biological safety cabinets and freezers and can accommodate SealSafe mouse racks. Materials classified as BSL3 agents will consist of SARS-CoV, bat CoV precursor strains, MERS-CoV, and mutants derived from these pathogens. Within the BSL3 facilities, experimentation with infectious virus will be performed in a certified Class II Biosafety Cabinet (BSC). All staff wear scrubs, PAPRs, tyvek suits and aprons, and shoe covers, and hands are double-gloved. BSL3 users are subject to a medical surveillance plan monitored by the University Employee Occupational Health Clinic (UEOHC), which includes a yearly physical, annual influenza vaccination, and mandatory reporting of any symptoms associated with CoV infection during periods when working in the BSL3. All BSL3 users are trained in exposure management and reporting protocols, are prepared to self-quarantine, and have been trained for safe delivery to a local infectious disease management department in an emergency situation. All potential exposure events are reported and investigated by EHS and UEOHC, with reports filed to both the CDC and the NIH. Neutralization efficacy was evaluated using percent neutralization assays against SAR-CoV Urbani (black) or SHC014-MA15 with a panel of monoclonal antibodies: (a) fm6 (n = 3 for Urbani, n = 5 for SHC014-MA15) 10,11 , (b) 230.15 (n = 3 for Urbani, n = 2 for SHC014-MA15), (c) 227.15 (n = 3 for Urbani, n = 5 for SHC014-MA15) and (d) 109.8 (n = 3 for Urbani, n = 2 for SHC014-MA15) 12 , were all originally generated against epidemic SARS-CoV. Each data point representative of multiple center value represents group mean and error bars defined by SEM. Coronavirus strains are maintained in quasi-species pools circulating in bat populations. (ab) Traditional SARS-CoV emergence theories posit that host range mutants (red-filled circle) represent random and rare occurrences that permit infection of alternative hosts. (a) The secondary host paradigm argues that a non-human host is infected by a bat progenitor virus and, through adaptation, facilitates transmission to humans; subsequent replication in humans leads to the epidemic virus. (b) The direct paradigm suggests that transmission occurs between bats and humans without an intermediate host required; selection then occurs in the human population with closely related viruses replicating in a secondary host, permitting continued viral persistence and adaptation in both. (c) The data from chimeric SARS-like viruses argue that the quasi-species pools maintain multiple viruses capable of infecting human cells without the need for mutations (red-filled circles). While adaptations in secondary or human hosts may be required for epidemic emergence, if combined with virulent CoV backbones (green outlines), epidemic disease may be the result in humans. Existing data supports elements of all three paradigms.",27a784189b091b9aad7f016229667a796c319c17,2015-11-09,"Menachery, Vineet D.; Yount, Boyd L.; Debbink, Kari; Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Plante, Jessica A.; Graham, Rachel L.; Scobey, Trevor; Ge, Xing-Yi; Donaldson, Eric F.; Randell, Scott H.; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Marasco, Wayne A.; Shi, Zhengli-Li; Baric, Ralph S.",Nature Medicine,10.1038/nm.3985,Nature Medicine,497.0,True,"Origin of the expansion mutation in myotonic dystrophy.

40,40,fa28e1fd6d07ba6f081f33eae1a18247e89456cc,,Peptide and protein nanoparticle conjugates: versatile platforms for biomedical applications,"Peptide-and protein-nanoparticle conjugates have emerged as powerful tools for biomedical applications, enabling the treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of disease. In this review, we focus on the key roles played by peptides and proteins in improving, controlling, and defining the performance of nanotechnologies. Within this framework, we provide a comprehensive overview of the key sequences and structures utilised to provide biological and physical stability to nano-constructs, direct particles to their target and influence their cellular and tissue distribution, induce and control biological responses, and form polypeptide self-assembled nanoparticles. In doing so, we highlight the great advances made by the field, as well as the challenges still faced in achieving the clinical translation of peptide-and proteinfunctionalised nano-drug delivery vehicles, imaging species, and active therapeutics. pharmacokinetics, enabling tissue targeting, and promoting cell and tissue penetration. 9 Similarly, NP drug delivery vehicles offer several benefits over the use of protein-and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which have emerged over the last 10 years as promising clinical tools for the treatment of a range of diseases. 10 In particular, NP platforms offer the possibility to incorporate multiple functionalities within a single construct. As a result, problems such as the poor tumour penetration often exhibited by ADCs can be overcome, as described in Section 5. 10, 11 Furthermore, the encapsulation of the therapeutic agent allows the need for a cleavable linkage to be avoided, and enables high levels of drug to be delivered for every recognition event. 12 The benefits of both bare NPs and those decorated by polypeptides, have also been widely exploited in the field of in vivo imaging. When compared to small molecule imaging agents, NPs often offer the advantages of greatly improved signal-to-noise ratios, stable signal generation, high spectral resolution for multiplexed detection, and the ability to display multimodal signal generation. 13,14 As a result, NPs have found increasing utility for imaging in a range of modalities, including near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence, 15 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 16 and positron emission tomography (PET) 17 . Indeed, many NP-based imaging technologies are now routinely used in a clinical setting. 18 Stimuli responsive NPs are also finding increasing utility within the biomedical field, often leading to the localised destruction of pathological tissue. 19 Whether as a result of magnetic or light induced hyperthermia, or NP-mediated photoablation, such technologies are strongly reliant on adequate accumulation at the site of treatment. Many systems rely on inorganic cores, from which it is vital to reduce the leaching of metal components due to their associated toxicity. As a result, peptide or protein coatings that can direct, stabilise, and eventually lead to the clearance of therapeutic NPs are a key component of these emerging technologies as they approach clinical application. 20
 NPs have found widespread use across the material, physical, engineering, and biological sciences, with the number of new technologies increasing at an exponential rate. 21 The particle structures which enable these applications are equally diverse, with precise control over material, architecture, and design enabling a broad spectrum of tunable properties dependent on the end application. 4 Despite this large variation, a number of NP formats have found particular utility in the biomedical field. Much of the research to be discussed within this review has focussed on the use of 6 main categories of NPs (though many others have also been utilised in more niche settings, such as peptide-based NPs as discussed in section 8). Each will be briefly introduced in order to contextualise the discussion that follows (Table 1) : i) Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). AuNPs are attractive structures for biomedical applications. 22 As one of the most stable and least toxic metal NP formulations, AuNPs offer a safe and effective diagnostic and therapeutic tool. 23 The ability of thiols to form stable linkages with the surface of AuNPs allows versatile surface chemistry to be achieved. 24 Decoration of the particle surface with a wide range of biomolecules enables the biodistribution, physical properties, and intracellular fate to be modulated. Furthermore, AuNPs exhibit unique optical and electronic properties, with concerted electron oscillation following excitation leading to strong light emission via localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). 25 Their interaction with light is strongly dependent on size, shape, surface chemistry, aggregation and environment. These properties enable the use of AuNPs in a range of imaging modalities, including NIR fluorescence, photoacoustic imaging, and x-ray computational tomography, as well as finding utility in photoablation and hyperthermic therapies. 22, 26 ii) Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). MNPs are composed predominantly of magnetically-responsive elements, such as iron, nickel, and cobalt in various different forms, and are finding increasing utility in the biomedical field. 27,28 Iron oxide particles have found most widespread use, particularly as high contrast imaging agents for MRI. 29 The application of alternating magnetic fields can also be utilised as a minimally invasive stimuli for generating hyperthermia as described above. 30 Finally, the inherent magnetism of MNPs enables their spatial distribution to be easily manipulated, allowing the guided delivery of drug-containing vehicles. 31 iii) Semi-conducting NPs and quantum dots (QDs). In order to undertake fluorescence imaging in vivo it is advantageous for emission to be in the NIR to allow tissue penetration. 32 Conventional small molecule NIR fluorophores suffer from poor photo-stability, high hydrophobicity which hinders distribution, and weak signal-to-noise generation. In contrast, semi-conducting NPs (and in particular QDs) possess narrow, size-tunable, and high quantum yield emission. 33 Furthermore, they can be excited with broad wavelength light and display greatly improved resistance to photobleaching and chemical degradation. They are therefore highly attractive structures for undertaking biomedical imaging. 34 However, the high toxicity of cadmium metal, common in many QD formulations, necessitates the use of stable coatings able to prevent leaching into the biological milieu. iv) Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs). MSNPs possess tunable pore sizes, large surface areas, and high pore volume. They are therefore attractive drug-delivery vehicles, with the ability to encapsulate a large payload of cargo ranging from small molecules up to large proteins. 35, 36 The ease of surface modification, and cost-effective and scalable production adds to the attractiveness of MSNPs. Furthermore, the classification of silica as a 'Generally Recognized as Safe' substance by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) greatly facilitates regulatory approval of MSNP technologies, though questions on the long-term effects, biodegradability, and biocompatibility of many silica nanotechnologies remain unanswered. 37 In addition to their applications in drug delivery, MSNPs have also found widespread use as imaging agents, as a consequence of their ability to encapsulate and concentrate contrast agents for a wide range of modalities. 38 v) Liposomes. Liposomes are spherical vesicles, most commonly composed of at least one bilayer of selfassembled phospholipids. The similarity of the liposome bilayer to that of the cell membrane is particularly attractive for drug delivery applications, and indeed liposomes are perhaps the mostly widely used and investigated NP carriers for drug delivery, and were amongst the first NP-based technologies to enter the clinic. 2 Liposomes are able to encapsulate both hydrophilic cargo, within the aqueous interior, and hydrophobics, within the membrane bilayer. Furthermore, liposomes can be readily functionalised with lipid, or hydrocarbon functionalised ligands, making them a stable, cost-effective, and attractive tool for biomedical applications. vi) Polymer nanoparticles. The versatility of synthetic polymers enables a wide range of particle architectures and end-applications to be explored. Polymer vesicles (commonly referred to as polymersomes) and micelles, composed of self-assembled amphiphilic block copolymers, are particularly attractive due to their ability to encapsulate cargoes in an analogous fashion to their corresponding lipidic analogues. 39, 40 The NP size, membrane thickness, porosity, and many other factors can be tuned by adjusting block length and pendant group functionalisation. Furthermore, the design flexibility enabled by synthetic polymer chemistry enables the introduction of stimuli-responsive or biologically active functionalities, which are able to modulate particle properties in a smart, predictable manner. 41 As such, polymer NPs are finding increasing use across a number of biomedical disciplines. Table 1: Most commonly used NPs in biomedical applications. 4 Particle type Advantages Disadvantages Gold NPs  Ease of surface modification  Active in range of imaging modalities  Size dependent properties  Can be utilised for photodynamic therapy  Non-biodegradable  Potential for low colloidal stability Magnetic NPs  Active for high-contrast MRI imaging  Can be guided magnetically  Can be utilised for photodynamic therapy  Cytotoxic and poor biocompatibility  Non-biodegradable Semi-conducting NPs and QDs  Size tunable, high quantum yield emission  Resistant to bleaching and degradation  Broad wavelength excitation  Narrow emission allows multiplexing  Fluorescence sensitive to surface functionalisation  Toxicity of metal components  Non-biodegradable Mesoporous silica NPs  Controllable porosity  Biodegradable  High loading capacity for cargo delivery  Ease of surface modification  Potential toxicity of degradation products Liposomes  Low immunogenicity and high biocompatibility  Ease of functionalization  Flexibility of formulation for tuning of structure  Can encapsulate hydrophilic and hydrophobic cargoes  Low loading efficiency of valuable cargo  Poor stability and prone to leakage Polymer NPs  Versatile function and structure  Ease of modification and tunability  Can be made to be degradable or stimuli responsive  Potential toxicity of both NP and degradation products

 Peptide and protein coatings can be used to improve upon the biological stability of delivered NPs and address these difficulties. By altering the interactions with host cells and circulating biomolecules, peptide/protein coatings can modulate and control tissue accumulation to ensure NP activity (Figure 2) . In order to understand how this can be achieved, it is important to first understand the factors which induce clearance. The adsorption of opsonins (plasma proteins such as Immunoglobulin G, complement factors, and fibrinogen) to the NP surface plays a prominent role in triggering clearance, by inducing macrophage recognition and subsequent elimination via phagocytosis. 56,57 By inhibiting this process, so too can the recognition and removal of NPs by the immune system be reduced. 56 In contrast, when the protein corona is enriched with serum albumins or lipoproteins (often referred to as dysopsonins) recognition is blocked and circulation times are increased. 53, 58, 59 Amongst the other NP properties known to promote clearance, surface charge and hydrophobicity are particularly important. Although conflicting reports exist on the relative clearance rates of positively or negatively charged particles, it has become apparent that a nearneutral charge may in fact be most favourable. 60 At the same time, a reduction in hydrophobicity has also shown to be a key parameter in reducing the uptake of NPs by macrophages. 45,60 While beneficial from a biological perspective, it is important to note that particles which exhibit neutral or low surface charge often exhibit reduced colloidal stability, as discussed in the subsequent section. 61 It is therefore important to consider the delicate balance that determines NP fate when designing peptide/protein coatings. Figure 4: Upon entering the body, NPs quickly acquire a protein corona. The exact composition of the corona is dynamic and highly dependent on the environment: a) An initial corona is formed of typically highly abundant proteins; b) Weakly bound proteins are gradually removed by proteins with a higher affinity for the NP surface; c) Adsorption of proteins can be dependent on the already existing coating, with inter-protein as well as protein-NP interactions determining affinity; and d) Gradually a stable coating of strongly adsorbed proteins is formed, creating a 'hard' protein corona.

 One widely utilised method to limit opsonisation and NP clearance from the circulation is the use of stealth polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), which form a protective layer around the NP, neutralizing surface charge, conferring hydrophilicity, and providing a steric barrier to adsorption. 56, 62 However, there is a fine line between providing a coating which improves biodistribution and diminishing interactions with target cells and tissues. 61 The coating of NPs with PEG has been associated with reduced cellular uptake and thus therapeutic efficacy, 63,64 the generation of PEG-specific antibodies which accelerate clearance from the blood, 65,66 and preferential accumulation in the liver and spleen 67 . The versatility of peptide design thus offers an attractive alternative to such coatings (Figure 2a) . The use of non-ionic peptides, or those offering zwitterionic balanced charge may be particularly useful for reducing clearance. Following this strategy, Guerrero et al conjugated the amphipathic peptide CLPFFD, previously shown to mediate transport across the blood-brain barrier, to AuNPs with the aim of increasing particle delivery to the central nervous system. 68 By reducing the negative charge relative to citratecapped AuNPs, not only was delivery to the brain improved but accumulation in the spleen was also reduced. However, this approach is not generally applicable. In a similar study, AuNPs were coated with the weakly negatively charged cell-penetrating peptide VG-21. 69 Although enabling improved cell delivery due to the presence of VG-21, preferential accumulation was also observed within the spleen. 69 Similarly, Morais et al reported that the coating of AuNPs with CALNN led to increased clearance and liver accumulation compared to citrate-capped particles. 70 These results highlight the difficulty in predicting pharmacokinetic properties -often apparently similar peptide sequences can have drastically different effects on clearance. This conclusion is strongly supported by the research of Poon et al, who revealed the complexity of designing peptide-NP conjugates for escaping the body's reticuloendothelial system. 71 By coating AuNPs with a mixture of PEG and either the negatively charged therapeutic peptide Myx or the positively charged cRGD targeting peptide, it was found that the effect of the PEG/peptide coating could act independently or synergistically, depending on the sequence employed. As such, it is important to evaluate NP pharmacokinetics on a case-by-case basis. An alternative approach to avoiding clearance is to rely on biological signalling to enhance retention. This has been most prominently achieved by using the membrane protein CD47. By interacting with the signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) and triggering downstream anti-phagocytic processes, CD47 acts in effect as a 'marker of self', sending out a 'do not eat me signal' (Figure 2b ). 72-75 Peptides derived to mimic the effect of CD47 have thus been designed and shown to reduce phagocytosis. 76 Importantly, peptide coated NPs displayed greatly reduced accumulation in the liver and spleen, and enhanced accumulation in cancerous tissues following intravenous injection ( Figure 5 ). Similarly, Qie et al recently demonstrated that NPs functionalised with full-length CD47 were also able to modulate clearance time, enabling the evasion of different macrophage populations. 77 However, this work also highlighted the need to better understand the interaction of nanomaterials with macrophages displaying distinct phenotypes, in order to pave for the way for truly immunologically inert nanomaterials. 77 Figure 7 : Schematic demonstrating the main mechanisms by which NPs are uptaken and subsequently intracellularly processed by cells. The exact mechanism taken by a particular particle is highly dependent on the precise NP characteristics, polypeptide coating layers, target cell type, and environment. The situation is further complicated by the ability of particles to exploit multiple different uptake pathways in parallel. Adapted with permission from Zhu et al. 149 Key peptide sequences By some estimates, in excess of 800 unique peptides have been identified which are able to promote cell penetration in in vitro experiments. 150 Of these, only a handful of prominent sequences or closely related analogues have been translated to biomedical applications. Although there are many possible explanations for the paucity of peptides that have been used in such settings, 2 factors are of particular importance. Firstly, many sequences induce toxicity, particularly amphipathic peptides which often induce membrane disruption in order to promote uptake. 151 Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, is the efficiency with which the best CPP peptides are able to deliver their cargo -it is difficult to improve upon the penetration efficiency, even if other properties leave a lot to be desired, as described below. The most commonly utilised method to mediate internalisation is to rely on highly cationic peptide sequences, able to first strongly bind negatively charged cell membranes and then induce transport via either a direct or endocytic pathway. This group includes the now ubiquitous human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) derived TAT peptide, as well as synthetic polyarginine and penetratin (derived from the Drosophila Antennapedia homeodomain) sequences. Indeed, the CPPs utilised for the in vivo delivery of NP substrates fall almost exclusively into this category. In 1999 Schwarze et al demonstrated that the conjugation of TAT to a protein substrate could be used to deliver the cargo to all parts of the body. 152 Since this initial report, a number of NP cargoes have been systemically delivered to all cells indiscriminately, with preferential localisation determined merely by the NP pharmacokinetics. 153, 154 The passive accumulation of NPs in tumours has also been exploited to allow the preferential delivery of TAT-labelled, drug-loaded micelles 155 and chitosan NPs 156 , as well as anti-tumour silver NPs 157 to tumour cells in animal in vivo models (Figure 8) . Similarly, arginine-rich peptides 158,159 and penetratin 160, 161 have been used to both penetrate tumour cells, following passive accumulation, and to target the brain as covered in Section 5.3. Interestingly, the non-natural D-enantiomer of TAT has also been shown to mediate cell penetration. This strongly suggests that NP uptake as a result of TAT decoration is not due to","The use of nanoparticles (NPs) provides new opportunities for the development of more effective, safe, and commercially-viable biomedical technologies. Whether as drug-delivery vehicles, high-contrast imaging agents, or active therapeutics, NPs enable new approaches to be taken for the treatment, diagnosis, or monitoring of disease within the human body. Unfunctionalised, naïve NP constructs are often able to fulfil their desired function under controlled in vitro settings. However, in the more complex environment of the human body many questions still remain -How can the particle be targeted to the site of disease? Can clearance be avoided to ensure a suitable therapeutic lifetime? Will the accumulation of a biomolecular corona diminish activity? In recent decades, the formation of peptide-or protein-NP conjugates has emerged as a vital tool for addressing many of the difficulties that arise as a result of these considerations. These hybrid materials enable the favourable characteristics of nano-sized structures to be combined with the biological activity, biocompatibility, and versatility of both naturally derived and synthetic polypeptides. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the development and use of peptide/protein-NP conjugates in biomedicine. While many reviews have previously been published on methods to create NP conjugates, or their subsequent applications within the body, the specific features imparted by the peptide or protein on the NP conjugate have been less widely discussed. We will therefore focus on the distinct roles played by the peptide/protein in improving, controlling, or defining the performance of nanotechnologies ( Figure 1 ). In doing so, we will deliver a detailed reference for both experts and those new to the field of NP technologies alike. Furthermore, we hope to stimulate discussion and innovation within the field, in order to overcome many of the difficulties that continue to hinder the clinical translation of these potentially powerful tools.
 The unique properties and size regime of NPs offer many benefits over small molecules and larger micrometre sized particles. These have been widely exploited within the biomedical field and reviewed extensively elsewhere. 1-6 By way of context for this review, we will briefly summarise here some of the key factors that make NP-based technologies particularly attractive, and the roles in which they have predominantly been applied. One of the most prominent realms in which NP systems have found utility is as vehicles for drug delivery. Small molecule drugs often suffer from poor pharmacokinetics, exhibiting rapid clearance and difficulties reaching the desired site-of-action in vivo. 1 As a result, severe side-effects may accompany any therapeutic benefit, while it is common for in vitro efficacy to be poorly translated to a clinical setting. 7 The ability of NPs to solubilise therapeutic molecules, enhance retention and circulation, and promote accumulation in the target tissue makes them attractive vehicles for overcoming these limitations, which hinder the drug discovery process. 8 These effects can be further enhanced through the incorporation of peptide or protein coatings, as will be the focus of this review, by further improving
 It is striking that the number of NP systems that have found successful application in biomedical applications pales in insignificance when compared to the vast body of literature on the use of NP constructs under controlled model settings. 42 This is predominantly due to the significant challenges associated with translating NP stability under idealised conditions to the complex environments of biologically relevant scenarios. 43 Peptide and protein coatings play a major role in enabling NP based technologies, and their ability to provide both biological and physical stability will be summarised in this section ( Figure 2 , Table 2, and Table 3 ). Importantly, these two factors are not necessarily independent or complementary. As will be discussed, a coating which prevents NP aggregation may also impact on the rate at which the construct is cleared from the circulation. It is therefore important to carefully consider design criteria in order to ensure that the end-application can be achieved.
 In order to reach the desired site-of-action, NPs must navigate their way around an ensemble of biological obstacles. These include defined biological surfaces, endothelial and cell membrane barriers to permeation, and circulating monocytes and macrophages of the body's immune system. 44 To achieve their function, NPs must circulate in the bloodstream for long enough to reach their target cells, tissues, or organs, whilst avoiding removal by active phagocytosis or renal clearance. 44, 45 The nanoscale dimensions in themselves can lead to greatly altered pharmacokinetic properties when compared to small molecules in vivo. For example, for 'hard' inorganic particles, renal clearance is greatly reduced above a diameter of ~5.5 nm due to the size cut-off of the kidneys for urinary excretion (Figure 3 ). 46 This ability of NPs to modulate pharmacokinetics has been widely utilised as a means to improve the retention, biodistribution, or in vivo stability of an encapsulated small molecule. 47 However, these differences do not come without their own challenges -dependent on the size, structure, or functionalisation of a NP, detrimental tissue accumulation can occur, while the uptake of particles by macrophages can not only lead to rapid removal from the circulation, but also the induction of an unfavourable inflammatory response. 48 Figure 2 : Methods by which peptide/protein-NP coatings can be designed to influence biological stability and decrease susceptibility to clearance: a) Recognition and clearance can be limited by providing balanced charge or surface hydrophobicity; b) 'Self-peptides' can be recognised by macrophages, and used to inhibit phagocytosis; and c) The formation of a protein corona can be modulated by providing a stable peptide/protein coating, promoting the absorption of dysopsonins, or by tuning NP properties such as size, shape, or charge (i-iii).
 As soon as NPs are introduced into a biological environment further complications arise, as a mixture of biomacromolecules interacts with the particle surface, often masking the effect of the particle and strongly influencing the pharmacokinetic properties. [49] [50] [51] In protein-rich media, such as blood, this new coating is referred to as the protein corona. The 'hard' corona is made up of tightly-bound proteins, forming thermodynamically favoured interactions with the NP surface, followed by a 'soft' corona of rapidly exchanging proteins ( Figure 4) . 52, 53 The nature of this biomolecule coating is highly dependent on the environment and thus difficult to predict, often resulting in a dramatic loss of activity or function and strongly influencing the nanomaterial fate in vivo. 45, 54, 55 78 The adsorption of dysopsonins is known to enhance retention. A third approach to improve NP pharmacokinetics is therefore to promote the formation of a favourable dysopsonin-protein corona ( Figure 2c ). This can be achieved either through the pre-coating of NPs prior to in vivo application, 79 or by tuning the NP surface properties to promote the enrichment of dysopsonins over opsonins in situ. 53, 80 Serum albumin, the most abundant protein in blood, plays a wide range of roles including acting as a molecular and protein transporter, maintaining oncotic pressure, and buffering blood pH. Pre-formation of an albumin corona is also able to act to prevent the attachment of alternative proteins and improve NP stability. 53 Peng et al showed that such a strategy was able to limit phagocytosis and prolong circulation time in vivo, through simple NP pre-incubation in a solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA). 58, 81 Hydrophobin, an exogenous protein expressed by fungi has high affinity for NP surfaces and can also alter the composition of the protein corona when NPs are exposed to bodily fluids. 52 The high affinity of hydrophobin enables the protein to remain strongly associated with the NP surface, even when in competition with other plasma proteins. Apolipoprotein coatings have also been shown to increase NP circulation time. A study of polystyrene-NP coatings demonstrated that amino and sulfonate functionalised particle coatings led to the accumulation of high levels of apolipoprotein. 59 These results highlight the importance of surface charge and functional groups on influencing protein corona formation. Notably, the binding of specific apolipoprotein subtypes was also shown to strongly influence subsequent cell uptake in vitro. 59 Schöttler et al demonstrated that the apolipoprotein clusterin (also known as ApoJ) reduced the non-specific cellular uptake of sterically protected polymer-NPs. 80 A recent study highlighted the effect of initial polymer coverage on the downstream effects of clusterin, which was able to shield NPs from opsonisation at low PEG densities but did not effect NP clearance at higher PEG coverages. 82 The downstream effects of protein corona formation must also therefore be considered. Fibrinogen is a circulating glycoprotein in the bloodstream and a well known opsonin able to inhibit cell adhesion at suitable concentrations. When low fibrinogen concentrations are adsorbed on NP surfaces, a single highly adhesive monolayer is formed. 83 In contrast, dense coatings at high concentrations reduce cell adhesion under both static and flow conditions, via the formation of a nanoscale multilayer matrix. 84 However, translating fibrinogen to designed NP coatings for increased circulation remains challenging, as fibrinogen can also lead to NP aggregation as a consequence of the formation of inter-particle bridges. 85 
 The physical stability of a NP construct is an important consideration when designing a biomedical technology. Not only are suitable stabilities required to ensure that the particle is able to fulfil its function, but the leaching of small molecules from the particle structure or the formation and accumulation of larger aggregates must also be controlled to minimise toxicity. In order to demonstrate the ability of NPs to be applied both in vitro and in vivo they must form a dispersed, stable suspension under physiological conditions. Several reports have demonstrated that agglomerated NPs have drastically altered effects on properties, in particular toxicity, which can lead to large discrepancies in experimental output. [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] Indeed, aggregated particles display a greatly decreased surface area and reduced cellular uptake when compared to dispersed particles, often leading to an underestimation of toxicity prior to application in vivo. In contrast, sedimentation and decreased diffusion can significantly impact the 'effective dose' experienced by cells in vitro, leading to large discrepancies in experimental readout and significantly decreased efficacy upon in vivo translation. 91, 92 NP aggregation can also trigger opsonisation in the bloodstream, as discussed above, making particles more visible to the phagocytotic system. 63, 64 Thus, physical stability and biological stability are intimately linked. The flocculation of particles in aqueous solution is governed by the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory (DLVO theory). 93, 94 The stability of the dispersion depends on the balance between attractive and repulsive forces -a particle becomes unstable and starts to agglomerate when the repulsive energy is not sufficient to counteract the van der Waals attractive energy. 88 At biological salt concentrations the situation becomes more complicated, however the basics for stability remain similar. 95 Sufficient electrostatic and steric stabilization is required to provide the repulsive energy to prevent agglomeration. 88 For biomedical applications, coatings must not only provide colloidal stability, but also aqueous solubility, while conserving the NP functionality. The formation of a protein corona upon application in vivo may either enhance or compromise NP colloidal stability. Most commonly, the steric bulk provided by the protein coating can provide significant stabilisation, limiting inter-particle attractive forces. 49, 96, 97 This phenomena is able to offset the low contribution of stabilising electrostatic repulsion forces which are largely negated in the presence of the high electrolyte concentrations of physiological conditions. 97, 98 Peptides have been particularly widely used to provide physical stabilisation to metal and semi-conductor particles, for which the high susceptibility to aggregation must be carefully mitigated. For example, depending on the capping layer utilised, unfunctionalised AuNPs are incredibly sensitive to environmental changes, with small changes in pH, salt concentration, temperature, or the presence of biomolecules often leading to rapid and irreversible aggregation. 26, 33, [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] Through combinatorial design, peptide sequences have been identified that are able to find a careful balance of charge, polarity, functionality, hydrophobicity, and length. 104 In 2004, Lévy et al identified the pentapeptide CALNN through such libraries, as a water-soluble peptide able to provide extremely stable AuNPs following surface functionalisation. 105 The presence of the N-terminal cysteine enables facile functionalisation of the particle surface, with the rest of the sequence providing a densely packed, negatively charged peptide corona which is able to withstand aggregation. The ability of thiols to bind to metal surfaces has led to cysteine capped peptides being widely utilised as capping agents for metal NPs. [106] [107] [108] [109] Indeed, peptides such as CALNN can be used as a core peptide to which additional biological functionality can be attached, providing a stable peptide-functionalised inner corona bearing pendant peptides which can then direct and influence NP activity. [110] [111] [112] However, although cysteine-metal binding is sufficient to provide stabilised NPs in vitro, the reversibility of thiolmetal bond formation means that ligand exchange can occur. [113] [114] [115] Although the concentration of free thiols in the blood is far lower than that observed intracellularly, it remains high enough to induce loss of monothiol coatings during circulation. 116 This is in part due to the possibility for dissociative ligand exchange (SN1-like pathway), in which ligands are rapidly diluted within serum upon dissociation, and replaced by circulating small molecule thiols. 117 In addition, the high levels of serum albumin in the blood, containing a single reduced cysteine residue, have been shown to mediate ligand exchange in biological samples. 118, 119 This loss of NP coating can lead to two, often concurrent outcomes in the dilute regime provided by in vivo settings: i) Replacement of the initial thiol coating by thiolated biomolecules, leading to a loss of any function imparted by the capping layer, as discussed throughout this review; and ii) Loss of any stabilization effects provided by the capping layer as ligands are gradually lost. 120 As a result, increasingly stabilised peptide coatings have been explored in recent years. This is often achieved through the use of multi-dentate binding sites -that is, to use multiple cysteine residues or unnatural amino acids bearing dithiol motifs, to provide multiple anchoring points to the metal surface for each individual peptide ( Figure 6 ). [121] [122] [123] [124] In doing so, even with reversible desorption of one thiol group from the metal surface, the other is still attached maintaining stability. Due to the proximity of the unbound thiol, this will then simply reattach and reform the stabilised NP construct. Figure 6 : Monothiol ligands are prone to ligand exchange on the surface of metal NPs, and coatings can therefore be rapidly lost in biological environments. In contrast, bidentate dithiol ligands offer increased stability, as two simultaneous exchange events are required in order to disrupt the coating. Alternatively, hexahistidine ligands offer strong and stable metal binding. 121, 125 An alternative approach, particularly widely employed for the functionalisation of QD surfaces, is the utilisation of poly-histidine sequences, able to form multi-dentate NP interactions. The ability of histidine residues to bind a variety of metals is well established throughout biology, and the hexa-histidine motif in particular has been found to form stable metal coordinates ( Figure 6 ). [126] [127] [128] Hexahistidine tagged peptides and proteins have therefore been widely used to provide stable biomolecule AuNP and QD coatings which are resistant to desorption for a wide variety of applications. 129, 130, 125, 131, 132 
 As discussed above, for a NP to be useful in biomedical applications, it is vital that the particle is able to reach the necessary site of actionthe ability of a NP to fulfil its specified purpose is not sufficient. This is particularly true for particles that are delivered systemically, rather than being applied directly at the desired site of action. Even once a particle has overcome the significant challenge of avoiding rapid clearance, the body places formidable barriers in the way of subsequent distribution and delivery of NPs at both the tissue and cellular level. 1 These restrictions are the body's way of protecting and maintaining homeostasis, preventing the uncontrolled transport of material into and out of sensitive environments. Penetrating these barriers remains one of the biggest challenges in biomedicine, both for small molecule therapeutics and the NPs that are the focus of this review. The decoration of particles with peptides or proteins able to mediate transport or penetration is at the forefront of efforts to enable NP technologies to reach the areas they need to perform their function. In this section, we will discuss each barrier in turn and give a critical overview of the key sequences that have been utilised to modulate NP transport across them (Table 4 and Table 5 ).
 The cell membrane is a selectively permeable barrier, which efficiently protects the cell interior from its environment. Some specific small molecules may be efficiently transported across the membrane, however the transfer of NPs into the intracellular space is far more challenging. 133 Although in some cases the uptake of unfunctionalised particles is possible, cell membrane impermeability often results in a highly detrimental lack of activity. 134 Furthermore, even when NPs are taken up by cells, for example via endocytosis, the challenges are not overup to 99 % of particles may be sequestered from the cytosol or nucleus in endosomes and organelles, depending on their exact properties, the target cell type, and the uptake mechanism. 135, 136 There is therefore a pressing need to develop NP constructs that can be directed to the desired site-of-action, in order to maintain functionality. In recent years the decoration of NP surfaces with peptides able to promote uptake has come to prominence, with many so-called 'cell-penetrating peptides' (CPPs) and sequences able to trigger receptor-mediated endocytosis being studied in detail. 137, 138 Furthermore, sequences able to efficiently promote endosomal escape following internalisation have also been identified and used to great effect. We will here first briefly discuss the key mechanisms of peptide-mediated NP uptake, before highlighting the main sequences that have been most widely utilised in biomedical applications. As a word of caution, it is important to note that the efficacy of both penetration and subsequent endosomal escape is highly dependent on the experimental conditions. 139,140 While a particular sequence may successfully mediate the transport of one NP cargo, it may fail to enable penetration of another. 141 Similarly, while uptake may be efficient with a cell line in vitro, such results may not be readily replicated in the corresponding tissue upon in vivo translation. It is therefore paramount to test and characterise a newly designed NP-CPP construct under biologically relevant conditions, rather than relying on literature precedence for the transport of related, but essentially distinct NP cargoes.
 In general, penetration mechanisms can be split into two major categories: i) direct, energy-independent pathways; and ii) those relying on active uptake via endocytosis ( Figure 7) . Often, multiple uptake pathways will be exploited in parallel, with the exact environmental conditions determining which process dominates. 142 As such, it can prove complicated to deduce the exact mechanism of internalisation and conflicting reports are therefore commonplace. 143 Direct uptake mechanisms are typically initiated by the interaction of the peptide-NP conjugate with the cell membrane, most commonly via electrostatic interactions of positively charged surfaces with negatively charged phospholipids. 110, 144 This is followed by permanent or transient destabilization of the cell membrane, for example through pore or inverted micelle formation. 142, 145 Although many CPPs were at first thought to be uptaken via such means, subsequent reports have demonstrated that experimental artefacts in fact led to initial discrepancies and it is no longer thought that direct uptake is the major contributing factor in the penetration of CPP-coated NPs. 145, 146 In contrast, during endocytotic uptake, interactions with cell membrane components lead to the engulfment of the peptide-NP construct, which is then transported intracellularly in endosomes. Endocytosis occurs predominantly via macropinocytosis, or clathrin-or caveolin-dependent receptor-mediated uptake, but in all cases subsequent escape of the cargo from their resultant endosomal location is a key step, as described in the subsequent section. The exact mechanism by which a particular NP is internalised is a vast area of research, and one which often remains contentious. Exact details are therefore outside the scope of this review and readers are instead directed to a number of excellent reviews on the topic. 133, 147, 139, 148 It has become increasingly evident that it is difficult to draw generalisations. Importantly, the precise means by which a particular construct is taken up is highly dependent on not only the peptide sequence used to promote uptake, but also on the target cell type, and perhaps most strongly the exact nature of the NP cargo, including size, structure, and surface properties.
 a specific biological interaction -rather it is the density or distribution of positive charges along the peptide backbone that are responsible for internalisation. 154, 162 Importantly, despite the ability of cationic peptides to increase uptake efficiency, cytosolic delivery of the NP cargo often remains low. 163 The strong affinity of positively charged peptides towards negatively charged endosomal membrane components may hinder endosomal escape. As a result, additional factors able to mediate this process may need to be incorporated during NP design, as discussed in section 5.2. 
 In all of the cases noted above, the low specificity of CPPs for a particular cell type or target organ leads to widespread tissue delivery. CPPs cross cell membranes in a largely indiscriminate manner, leading to the uptake of NPs by almost all cells that are encountered. As such, technologies relying on these sequences are often associated with significant side-effects, particularly when they are used to deliver a therapeutic payload. In order to address this limitation, a number of methods for CPP 'screening' have been reported that enable NP targeting prior to unmasking of the penetrative sequence. In an important early demonstration of this principle the Tsien group attached a complementary polyanionic peptide, able to electrostatically bind and thus block the activity of a polyarginine CPP, via a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) cleavable linker region. 164 In the presence of the corresponding protease, typically upregulated within the tumour environment, peptide cleavage resulted in the unmasking of the cationic CPP and intracellular payload delivery. Such systems have been subsequently utilised for the intracellular delivery of QDs 165 and more recently for the selective in vivo delivery of PEG-polycaprolactone (PCL) NPs to tumours 166 ( Figure 9 ). 166 
 A related approach is to screen the activity of the CPP using steric bulk. Harris et al reported the coating of TAT-functionalised iron oxide NPs with a shield of PEG, via a MMP-2 cleavable peptide linker. 167 Upon action of the protease within the tumour environment, the TAT peptide was unmasked enabling cell uptake. Alternatively, ultra-violet (UV) light-cleavable groups can be used to trigger cleavage of appended lipids with spatial precision. 168 Finally, hydrazone-linked PEGs that are cleaved in the mildly acidic tumour environment have also been reported for the selective unblocking of TAT peptides at the desired site-of-action. 169, 170 Importantly, hydrazone structure has been shown to play a vital role in the rate of hydrolysis, and thus the ability of the NP construct to undergo acid-mediated cleavage. By suitable choice of coupling partners, hydrazone half-life can be tuned from a matter of minutes, all the way up to months at neutral pH. 171, 172 This therefore represents an important consideration during construct design. For example, aliphatic hydrazones may display insufficient stability to allow application in vivo, 170 while diaryl linkages may prove too stable to allow acid responsive behaviour to be displayed. 173 Role of peptide/protein density The density of CPP surface coverage is an important determinant of NP behaviour. Sufficient ligands must be presented to enable efficient penetration, while also avoiding overcrowding which can diminish bioactivity and prevent the presentation of dual-functionalities. 174 In the early 2000s, Zhao et al demonstrated that the efficiency of MNP uptake was highly dependent on the number of conjugated TAT peptides. 175 Penetration was greatly enhanced when more than 10 peptides were displayed on the particle surface, with a non-linear response suggesting multi-valent interactions were at least partially responsible for the increase in efficiency. This has been validated by a number of subsequent reportsa lower coverage of peptides bearing multiple CPP arms often results in a higher cell uptake than that observed for particles coated with a high density of mono-valent peptides, though the effect is not universal. 176, 177 Indeed, in a recent report Breger et al demonstrated that QDs decorated with a single ligand could be efficiently uptaken if a multivalent dendrimeric CPP was presented. 177 A number of hypotheses have been made to explain the origins of these effects, and, as is often the case, the exact answer is probably dependent on the precise cell type, NP cargo, and construct design. While receptor clustering and crosslinking is known to play a major role in many cell-surface recognition events and may also be important in mediating cell uptake, an increase in membrane curvature and pore formation as a result of greater localised electrostatic binding has also been proposed to play a role. 177, 178 Intriguingly, the Jana group has recently demonstrated that the valency itself is a key determinant in not only uptake mechanism, but also subsequent sub-cellular location, and indeed the rate at which particles are subsequently ejected by exocytosis. 179 A high valency of TAT peptides on the surface of QDs was found to lead to an increased rate of initial cell uptake. However, the same particles were then rapidly processed and exocytosed, leading to an overall drop in penetration efficiency. 180 
 As described above, the endocytosis of NPs (both with and without peptide functionalisation) leads to internalisation within endosomes. Unless for tissue imaging purposes, this location is typically not the end target, with delivery to the cytosol or nucleus usually necessary for activity. As such, the endosomal escape of the NP cargo is an essential yet often overlooked factor in enabling function. While a number of small molecule additives such as chloroquine may act as transduction enhancers, their use is not a plausible solution for cell penetration in vivo. As an alternative, a number of peptide sequences have been identified that are able to promote escape, typically through the formation of disruptive α-helices, which can be triggered selectively within the acidic environment of endosomal compartments. 181 The N-terminal domain of influenza virus hemagglutinin HA2 was one of the earliest sequences identified, with Plank et al demonstrating that HA2 functionalisation of DNA-based NPs greatly enhanced cell transduction. 146, 181, 182 Other sequences, such as oligomers of the tetrapeptide GALA 183 and Penetration Accelerating Sequence (Pas) 184, 185 have also been utilised to promote the endosomal escape of functionalised liposomes and QDs respectively. An alternative approach to enhance escape has recently been reported by Morshed and co-workers. By attaching TAT peptides to AuNPs via an acid labile hydrazone linkage, they were able to promote endosomal escape through cleavage of the CPP. Using a non-cleavable linkage resulted in the strong binding of the peptide to the negatively charged endosomal membrane being retained and thus hindered particle escape. 186 
 The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a formidable and restrictive obstacle, able to exclude over 98 % of small molecule drugs and almost all nanoscale objects in order to maintain brain homeostasis. 187, 188 The endothelial cells of the brain capillaries form continuous tight junctions that preclude paracellular transport. 188, 189 While it is possible to disrupt this barrier and allow passage between cells, more commonly strategies which aim to overcome the BBB rely on transport through the cells that make up the barrier ( Figure 10 ). However, the downregulation of receptors that mediate vesicular transport, and the presence of highly active efflux pumps makes even such transcellular movement difficult. 188 Four main strategies have been exploited in order to allow BBB penetration, each of which can be exploited by peptide or protein decorated NPs: i) Receptor-mediated transport, whereby NP interactions with over-expressed receptors at the BBB trigger internalisation; ii) Transporter-mediated movement, hijacking the natural uptake of nutrients such as glutathione by the brain; iii) Adsorptive transport, as a result of the strong binding of positively charged particles to the negatively charged BBB; and iv) The exploitation of CPPs, which have also been demonstrated to mediate transport across the BBB ( Figure  10 ). For an in depth discussion on these processes and the mechanisms by which NPs can be transported across the BBB the reader is referred to excellent recent overviews by the groups of Teixidó, Gao, and Tosi. 187, 188, 190 Importantly, the 'leakiness' of the BBB is often increased during pathogenesis. This is particularly true for tumours originating in the brain, more commonly referred to as gliomas. 191 Gliomas are therefore commonly used as a model system on which to demonstrate the ability of a particular NP construct to penetrate the BBB. While this is not in itself problematic, it is important to have in mind the possible effects of impaired cellular junctions on NP transport in such systems. 
 The key CPP sequences utilised for the in vivo delivery of NPs, as outlined in section 5.1, have all also been utilised to deliver NP cargoes across the BBB. Their ability to penetrate the cells of the brain endothelium enables transcellular transport into brain tissue. QDs, 192 peptide self-assemblies, 193 and AuNPs 186, 194 have all been shown to penetrate the brain following TAT functionalisation. Similarly, the delivery of polyarginine-functionalised liposomes 195 and penetratin-labelled PEG-PLA particles 160 has also been reported. However, as described above, the promiscuity of CPPs limits any specificity for brain targeting and these reports are also associated with systemic delivery to other organs and tissues. As a result, strategies improving specificity for brain targeting represent a more attractive solution.
 The most common technique to promote BBB specific transport is to target receptors at the blood-brain interface, which are able to induce receptor-mediated endocytosis. The transferrin-receptor (TfR) is overexpressed on brain endothelial cells, playing a crucial role in the transport of iron across the BBB by mediating the endocytosis and transport of the iron-binding protein transferrin (Tf). The attachment of Tf itself to NPs has therefore been widely used as a means to mediate BBB penetration, transporting a range of structures including drug-loaded serum albumin NPs, 196 liposomes, 158, 197, 198 polymersomes, 199 and polymer dendrimer particles, 200 as well as RNA-based structures 201 . Alternatively, anti-TfR antibodies, such as OX26 can be utilised to mediate transport. [202] [203] [204] [205] However, possible difficulties with the speciesspecificity of antibodies may partially hinder such technologies. For example, since OX26 is targeted to the rat TfR, NPs coated with this antibody are unable to be readily translated into human systems. 206 The use of the TfR as a target for BBB penetration has significant limitations in spite of its attractiveness as a target. Firstly, the TfR is commonly expressed on the surface of many tissues, in particular the liver and spleen, lowering organ specificity. 158, 207 Secondly, and more significantly, due to the importance of transporting iron to all areas of the body the physiological levels of Tf circulating in the blood are high, leading to virtual saturation of the TfR and preventing the binding of exogenous protein. 208 This greatly limits the ability of Tf-labelled NPs to cross the BBB.
 Receptors for the closely related iron-binding protein lactoferrin (Lf) are also commonly over-expressed at the BBB. 187 Since the endogenous circulating level of Lf is far lower than that of Tf, receptor targeting is greatly facilitated. 209 As a result, a wide range of Lf-conjugated NPs have been reported, and demonstrated to cross the BBB. 208, [210] [211] [212] [213] [214] An alternative solution to the high physiological levels of circulating Tf has been offered by Lee et al. 215 Through phage display, they were able to identify a short peptide sequence capable of binding the TfR in a non-competitive manner with Tf. As a result, efficient receptor mediated endocytosis can be instigated even at saturating levels of Tf. 216 Recently Prades et al demonstrated that N-methylated, enantio, and retro-enantio derivatives of this peptide maintained or even enhanced the ability to transport NPs across the BBB, while decreasing susceptibility to protease mediated-degradation particle clearance ( Figure 11 ). 217 This work represents an impressive demonstration of the synthetic versatility of peptides and their ability to greatly improve the characteristics of NP cargoes. The short peptides Angiopep-2 and glutathione (GSH) represent two of the most promising candidates for the clinical translation of BBB-penetrating NP technologies. Both peptides have the ability to target and be internalized by receptors overexpressed on brain endothelium, specifically low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and the GSH receptor respectively. These two peptide sequences have been widely studied for their ability to mediate transport. Importantly, they both display extremely low associated toxicities and are therefore key components of a number of technologies currently in clinical trials. 188, 218 Angiopep-2 was first identified by Demeule et al from the LRP binding Kunitz domain of a number of proteins able to cross the BBB. 219 In the subsequent 10 years, Angiopep-2 has been utilised to deliver a wide range of NP cargoes across the BBB, including liposomes, polymer-, upconverting-, and gold-NPs ( Figure 12 ). 166, [220] [221] [222] [223] [224] [225] [226] [227] [228] [229] Similarly, GSH decoration has been used extensively to deliver NPs, particularly drug-loaded liposomes, across the BBB. [230] [231] [232] Indeed, technologies based on these systems for the delivery of doxorubicin to gliomas have recently completed Phase I/IIa clinical trials using the tradename G-technology® formulation. 188
 Sons. 226 In addition to these prominent examples, a number of other peptide sequences have been identified which are able to mediate transport across the BBB. Many of these are derived from pathogens or toxins, mimicking the ability of the parent protein/peptide to elicit damage within the brain by either disrupting the endothelial membrane or by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The snake venom-based peptides CDX 233 and chlorotoxin 234, 235 , bee venom-derived MiniAp-4, 236 opioid glycopeptide g7, 237, 238 and rabies virusderived peptide RV29 239, 240 have all been shown to enable the delivery of NP cargoes across the BBB. Finally, the attachment of cationic proteins has also proved to be an effective method for promoting NP transport. In particular, the cationization of serum albumin proteins and subsequent NP decoration has been shown to promote BBB penetration. Initial binding is induced by electrostatic interactions with the highly negatively charged brain endothelium, and is followed by subsequent adsorptive-mediated transcytosis. 241-244
 The structural and functional abnormality of tumour tissues offers many opportunities for NP delivery and penetration, but also many challenges which must be overcome. Early studies in rodents suggested that the endothelial barriers lining the vasculature displayed increased permeability to large species, while reduced lymphatic drainage enhanced tumour retention. 245, 246 These two factors combined form the basis for the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. 247 However, the impact of the EPR effect on nanomedicine remains highly controversial. [248] [249] [250] [251] While studied extensively in rodents, the clinical relevance of the EPR effect in human patients remains uncertain. Even within a single model species the porosity of the vasculature can vary dramatically depending on the tumour type, growth stage, microenvironment, and even individual. 252 Furthermore, even with accumulation, the subsequent transport of particles across the blood-tumour barrier and penetration of the poorly vascularised, hypoxic environment of densely cellularised solid tumours remains problematic. A number of peptide sequences have been identified that are able to first target NPs to the tumour site, and then also lead to their distribution across the entire mass. Amongst these, the C-end rule (CendR) class of peptides identified and pioneered by the Ruoslahti group are particularly prominent. CendR peptides were first isolated from phage display libraries by Teesalu et al. 253 By screening peptides against cancer cells they were able to identify a consensus (R/K)XX(R/K) sequence which promoted cell uptake. This sequence shares homology with the neuropilin-1 binding domain of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (with which CendR peptides are thought to compete for uptake). 253 Importantly, this motif must be present at the C-terminus of the peptide in order to cause penetration, hence the name CendR.
 Internal or reversed sequences have no biological effect. Importantly, the requirement for the CendR sequence to be placed at the peptide C-terminus enables it to be used as a cryptic internal sequence, blocked by a protease-sensitive directing motif for specific delivery to a target tissue. This was exploited by Sugahara et al to produce the peptide iRGD, able to both target a variety of NP substrates and promote their uptake after protease processing. 254, 255 This is achieved through a multi-step mechanism, in which binding is first induced by interaction of a terminal RGD motif with integrins overexpressed on the surfaces of many tumours (see section 6.1). This targeting moiety is then proteolytically cleaved exposing a CendR peptide, which induces cell penetration following interaction with nueropilin-1. Combining the RGD targeting and CendR penetration motifs within a single modular peptide construct enabled greatly enhanced tumour penetration of lipid micelles, iron oxide nanoworms, and albumin NPs, when compared to particles bearing either motif in isolation ( Figure  13 ). 254 iRGD NP decoration has subsequently been utilised to deliver polyethylenimine (PEI)-PEG NP gene therapies to glioblastomas, 256 iron oxide imaging agents to detect breast cancer metastasis, 257 and doxorubicin coated AuNPs to deep tumour sites 258 .
 As will be discussed in section 6.1, a number of peptide sequences which target NPs to cancerous regions have been identified and used to home particles to the desired site. Most sequences often merely lead to NP distribution in the periphery of the tumour vasculature, rather than actively enabling penetration into the deeper tissue. However, a smaller number of peptide sequences have been identified that are able to promote both processes, first targeting NP delivery to the tumour, then penetrating away from the vasculature via receptor mediated transcytosis. One such peptide sequence is IL-13p, a truncated derivative of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13). IL-13 has a promiscuous receptor activating profile throughout the body, yet IL-13p has been found to be selective for the receptor IL-13Rα2, which is strongly overexpressed on the surface of many tumour cells and thus represents an interesting target for tumour-directed therapies. 259 In addition to providing receptor specificity, IL-13p overcomes the low stability and high immunogenicity of the parent protein. Furthermore, it has been found to subsequently promote cell and tumour penetration, making it an effective tool for NP delivery. 260 In a series of papers, Gao and co-workers demonstrated that IL-13p decorated PEG-PCL NPs could be used to efficiently deliver anti-cancer therapeutics and suppress glioma growth in vivo. 259, 261, 262 Wang et al have also demonstrated that the targeting of IL-13Rα2 with a phage-display derived binding peptide enables glioma targeting and penetration, allowing the delivery of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-PEG NPs. 263 In a similar manner, the cyclic peptide Lyp-1, first identified from phage-display libraries by Laakkonen et al, is a tumour-homing peptide targeting the over-expressed p32 receptor. 264 Karmali et al demonstrated that delivery of the clinically approved paclitaxel NP delivery vehicle Abraxane® could be significantly improved through Lyp-1 decoration. 265 Subsequent investigations have further developed this peptide, by combining Lyp-1 with a cryptic CendR motif, greatly increasing cell penetration as well as distribution throughout the tumour mass, and thus increasing the efficacy of therapeutic delivery. 266,267 
 Directing a NP construct to the organ or tissue in which its action is required is crucial in ensuring the successful function of both therapeutic and diagnostic tools. The ability of peptides and protein coatings to modulate distribution within the body has been widely exploited. When combined with motifs that reduce clearance by the reticuloendothelial system and successfully deliver particles intra-cellularly, targeted delivery can lead to highly potent nano-technologies. Targeting approaches can be broadly classified into two modes, 'passive' and 'active', though these names can be misleading. They imply the rational targeting of particles through design rather than natural distribution, and active guiding to the target site rather than localisation through chance encounters respectively. 247 Passive targeting exploits the normal NP biodistribution, as typified by the observed accumulation of particles in the vasculature of some tumours via the EPR effect, as discussed above. 268 While this may also enable targeting of the liver and spleen, in which NPs are naturally deposited following clearance from the blood, other organs and tissues require more sophisticated 'active' means of directing delivery. 269 This is most commonly achieved through the introduction of a recognition motif around the corona of the NP, that can preferentially bind cell-surface receptors and other biomolecules exposed within the target area. Small molecules and vitamins, carbohydrates, peptides, proteins, and aptamers can all be utilised to target delivery. 270 In this section, we will discuss the most common polypeptide sequences utilised to direct NP transport, and their impact on biomedical technologies.
 Short peptides have emerged as the preferred agent for influencing NP distribution due to a number of advantageous properties (Table 6) . Firstly, when compared to full size protein targeting agents peptides are able to form compact NP coatings due to their small size, limiting disruption of the NP hydrodynamic diameter. Furthermore, their surface loading can be controlled, enabling the simultaneous presentation of multiple targeting sequences, providing high affinity and synergistic binding. Peptides of less than 30 amino acids can also be accessed in a straightforward manner via solid-phase peptide synthesis, enabling the facile introduction of functional chemical handles and non-natural residues. This may provide both ease of conjugation, and sequences with increased binding and thus targeting efficiencies. Finally, peptides offer the possibilities of lowered immunogenicity, increased stability of presentation, and reduced binding to physiological biomolecules when compared to full length proteins. 271 Many of the peptide-targeting ligands utilised in biomedical applications were first identified from phage display panning experiments against a target tissue, receptor, or cell type. [272] [273] [274] [275] First reported in 1985 by Smith, phage display relies on the presentation of short amino acid sequences on the protein coating of filamentous phage. 276 Random peptide libraries of a defined length can be expressed, and then screened for binding against the target. Following several rounds of increasingly stringent screening, coupled with the amplification of binding phage, peptides with high target affinity can be identified. 277 Phage display has been most widely used to screen binding to a target protein or cell-surface receptor. However it is also possible to systemically deliver phage libraries in vivo. Using this technique, phage binding to a target tissue or organ have been isolated and peptide sequences mediating cargo transport to the desired location identified. 274, [278] [279] [280] The Ruoslahti group have utilised in vivo bio-panning to identify a number of sequences able to target NP delivery, particularly for cancerous tissue. 264, [281] [282] [283] Åkerman et al demonstrated that 3 of these sequences, GFE (targeting membrane dipeptidase on the endothelial cells of lung vasculature), 281 F3 (binding blood vessels and various tumour cell types), 282 and Lyp-1 (targeting tumour lymphatic vessels, as discussed in section 5.4), 264 could be used to selectively deliver QDs in vivo. 284 Interestingly, F3 and Lyp-1 labelled particles can be used for the multiplexed imaging of both the blood and lymphatic vessels within the same tumour ( Figure 14) . The exquisite sensitivity and target specificity offered by these sequences is in part due to their multivalent presentation on the QD surface. This highlights the power of combining peptide display with nanomaterials for biomedical imaging. In a similar manner, the tumour-homing pentapeptide CREKA was also identified from phage libraries, and found to target the clotted plasma proteins that accumulate within the interstitial tissue and vessel walls in cancerous masses ( Figure 15 ). 285, 286 This peptide was able to deliver both iron oxide NPs and liposomes to the desired site, where they were observed to induce additional clotting and thus amplified accumulation. Poor perfusion of the tumour vasculature has been shown to limit the penetration of NPs into the tumour tissue and presents a major obstacle to effective tumour treatment. In section 5 we introduced a number of sequences which address these difficulties, mediating transcellular transport deep into the tumour mass. The Lyp-1 peptide described above is one such sequence, playing a dual-functional role in mediating both targeting and penetration. As discussed in section 5.4, Karmali et al demonstrated that combining the CREKA and Lyp-1 peptide sequences within a single NP construct enabled both the targeted delivery and tumour penetration of paclitaxel containing Abraxane® particles. 265 Accumulation and tumour penetration were greatly enhanced when both peptides were present, compared to NPs functionalised with a single species, demonstrating the ability of CREKA and Lyp-1 to act in a synergistic fashion to minimise tumour growth. The phage-display derived CendR family of peptides, introduced in section 5.4 as tumour-penetrating sequences, can also be combined with targeting motifs to provide dual-functional linear peptides. Indeed, as discussed previously the internalizing iRGD sequence makes use of one of the most widely studied and utilised targeting groups, RGD, to direct cargo to cells overexpressing αv integrin. 253-255 iRGD coated NPs have been shown to be efficient vehicles for drug-delivery and imaging applications. [256] [257] [258] In contrast, RGD peptides lacking the proteolytic sites required to expose the CendR sequence, do not enable the penetration of deep tumour tissue in vivo, despite their ability to instigate tumour delivery. 254, 287, 288 A number of other peptide sequences able to target NPs to tumour tissue have been identified, including cyclic-and linear-NGR (binding the tumour vasculature receptor CD-13). [289] [290] [291] [292] [293] Many peptides have been identified that target a wide range of tumour types. Sequences also exist for directing particles to a specific cancer, through binding to over-expressed tissue-specific receptors. For example, the bladder cancer binding peptide Bld-1 was identified from whole cell phage-panning by Lee et al. 294 This peptide has subsequently been shown to mediate the directed delivery of doxorubicin-loaded MSNPs for the treatment of bladder cancer. 295 Similarly, peptides able to bind human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) have been utilised to selectively deliver NPs to breast cancer tissue, mimicking the activity of anti-HER2 antibodies used in a number of clinical breast cancer treatments. [296] [297] [298] Additional imaging and therapeutic NP-peptide conjugates have been developed for specifically targeting prostate cancer, 299,300 predominantly using sequences identified through biopanning against cancerous cells in vivo. Although peptides targeting tumours have been most widely studied, other sequences specific for healthy tissue have also been identified and used to deliver NP cargoes. Adipose tissue has been particularly widely targeted as a consequence of its important role in obesity and related pathologies. Kolonin et al first identified the white fat directing peptide CKGGRAKDC from phage-display libraries and demonstrated its ability to carry pro-apoptotic peptides for the reversal of obesity ( Figure 16 ). 301, 302 Hossen et al subsequently demonstrated the delivery of drug-loaded PEGylated NPs for the control of adipose behaviour and weight gain. 303 This peptide has also been reported to mediate the delivery of proangiogenic agents, able to stimulate the conversion to brown adipose tissue which is more readily expended during normal energy usage. 304 The heart and brain are major organs of interest for the delivery of NPs for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Following myocardial infarction, the leakiness of blood vessels in the left ventricle promotes passive NP accumulation. 268 Particles can also be selectively delivered by targeting the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, commonly overexpressed in infarcted tissue. Dvir et al demonstrated that a truncated 9 amino acid peptide mimicking the behaviour of angiotensin II was thus able to direct the delivery of therapeutic liposomes. 305 Alternatively, Nguyen et al reported that the overexpression of MMPs within the heart following infarction could be used to direct the aggregation of drug-loaded NPs, following proteolytic degradation of hydrophilic surface peptides and thus accumulation at the infarct site. 306 In order to mediate NP delivery to the brain, Mann et al recently developed the short tetrapeptide CAQK, which despite its relatively short length, is remarkably able to target the delivery of both small molecule and NP cargoes. 307 Importantly, this peptide displayed affinity for the extravascular tissue, rather than the blood vessels themselves. As a result, delivery was enabled throughout the site of acute brain injury for the distribution of therapeutic payloads. In addition to peptides which can direct the delivery of particles to certain parts of the body, several sequences able to drive NP accumulation within specific subcellular locations following cell uptake have also been identified. Distinct from peptides that induce cell penetration or endosomal escape, these sequences enable intracellular trafficking to the site at which their action is required. 271 Although such sequences have been most commonly utilised for the in vitro study or targeting of intracellular processes, more recent studies have also demonstrated their application in a biomedical setting. 271 Agemy et al combined the mitochondrial targeting peptide (KLAKLAK)2 with tumour-targeting CGKRK and penetrating iRGD sequences, to form a tri-functional iron oxide NP coating, able to efficiently deliver particles within mouse glioblastoma models. In addition to its targeting role, (KLAKLAK)2 also promoted apoptosis through disruption of the mitochondrial membrane, increasing the therapeutic effect. 308 In another example, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal 'Eriss' (derived from the adenovirus E13-19K protein) has been used to direct NPs to the ER of lymphocytes, improving the processing and presentation of NP-displayed antigens. By doing so, the efficiency of synthetic vaccines can be greatly enhanced in vivo as discussed in section 7, leading to an improvement in the generation of immunity. 309,310 
 The recognition of protein binding partners by cell-surface receptors is one of the most important interactions in biology. The vast number of hormones, growth factors, cytokines, cell adhesion proteins, and cell-signalling structures are involved in virtually all intracellular interactions that enable the formation and function of complex tissues. 311 It is therefore not surprising that protein-NP coatings have become an important means to drive targeted delivery to a certain area of the body where a particular receptor is likely to be overexpressed (Table 7) . 270, 275 As described in section 5.3, the iron-binding proteins Tf and Lf mediate the transport of this key nutrient around the body. NPs coated with these structures can therefore be targeted to sites where their relevant receptors are expressed, as epitomised by their ability to deliver particles to, and indeed induce transport across, the BBB. 187 The TfR has a particularly widespread distribution throughout the bodyalmost all cells are thought to express cell surface TfR, albeit at significantly varying levels. 312 However, the overexpression of TfR in certain cancers as a result of rapid cell growth kinetics, and thus a demanding need for iron, enables the use of Tf as a targeting agent when combined with potential particle accumulation within the tumour vasculature via the EPR effect. 313 Interestingly, a number of papers have demonstrated that TfR targeting does not occur as a result of altered biodistribution, with similar accumulation kinetics being observed for both functionalised and non-functionalised NPs. Instead, it is the ability of the targeting group to induce penetration and uptake within the target tissue that leads to an enhancement of the therapeutic efficiency of NP drug-delivery vehicles. 314, 315 The degree of Tf modification plays an important role in determining the level of NP uptake, whether through multi-valent interactions or increased chance of recognition. 315, 316 Salvati et al have also highlighted the importance of carefully designing NP coatings in order to maintain maximal activity in vivo. Following the incubation of Tf-functionalised silica NPs in serum, they showed that rapid loss of TfR targeting occurred due to the accumulation of a blocking protein corona. 317 Despite this sensitivity, Tf functionalisation has been the most widely utilised strategy for directing tumour delivery. Such systems have been shown to mediate the transport of a wide range of NP cargoes, as well as being at the core of several liposomal based therapeutic technologies currently in clinical trials ( Figure  17 ). 313, 314, 316, [318] [319] [320] [321] Many other protein ligands have also found widespread use for the selective targeting of NPs to cell surface receptors within a specific tissue or organ. An important consideration is the ability of many such ligands to trigger cellular responses and downstream effects. While this may be favourable in certain applications, in such cases the protein substrate is not merely acting as a targeting motif but is also controlling or inducing a biological effect. 322 For example, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and VEGF have been used to target NPs to their relevant receptors, when overexpressed on the surface of tumour cells and tissues. 270, [322] [323] [324] [325] [326] [327] However, the potency of growth factors as cell signalling moieties and their often promiscuous activation profiles must be carefully controlled, particularly following systemic delivery. Furthermore, cell-surface adhesion motifs can also be targeted. Chen et al demonstrated that iron oxide NPs could be functionalised with lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 proteins, able to target intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the surface of both tumour cells and inflamed tissue in vivo. 328 High density lipoproteins (HDLPs) have also found utility for selective NP delivery. These lipid-protein hybrids naturally form spherical particles in order to mediate the transport of lipids around the body. The interaction of HDLPs with a number of receptors commonly implicated in pathological conditions can be exploited to deliver NP based therapeutic agents and imaging tools. 270 The scavenger receptor type B-1 (SR-B1) has been most widely targeted. For example, Yang et al demonstrated that AuNP templated HDLP particles could be used to selectively sequester cholesterol in vivo ( Figure 18 ). These structures could be targeted to B-cell lymphoma cells, due to their need for cholesterol and thus upregulated expression of SR-B1. 329 Similarly, apolipoprotein A-I, the major component of HDLPs, has been demonstrated to enable the selective delivery of fluorescent NPs to cancerous tissue in vivo. 330 Although cell surface receptors are the most commonly utilised target for NP delivery, other cell or tissue specific markers can also be utilised to mediate NP targeting. Most prominently, lectins, or carbohydrate-binding proteins, can direct NPs to tissues displaying particular cell-surface glycans. 270 Glycoproteins and glycolipids play a vital role in cell biology, providing stability to the cell membrane, facilitating cellular recognition, and adding an extra level of complexity and functionality to the proteins that determine cell behaviour. With rapidly improving tools for studying the role of glycans in many normal and diseased states, so their biological importance is being increasingly appreciated. As a result, specific glycoforms have now been identified to be more prominently displayed during certain pathologies, making them attractive targets for NP delivery. Lectins commonly display exquisite sensitivity for a particular sugar structure and conformation, often analogous to that shown by antibodies. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) binds specifically to N-acetylglucosamine residues commonly found on the alveolar epithelium, and has thus been utilised by Surti and Misra to deliver corticosteroid loaded NPs to lung tissue. 331 A number of groups have subsequently used WGA to induce the intra-nasal transport of functionalised NPs, due to its ability to both bind and promote transcellular delivery across the epithelial barriers of the nasal passageway. [332] [333] [334] Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-1) can also be used to selectively bind α-fucose residues on the surface of microfold cells (M-cells) within the small intestine. 335 Oral delivery of UEA-1 labelled antigen containing NPs enables the initiation of a mucosal immune response and vaccination of the recipient. 336, 337 Mucosal M-cells can also be targeted via intranasal delivery, providing a facile means to undertake needle-free NP immunization. 338 
 The ability of antibodies (Abs) to bind with high specificity and affinity for their target antigen makes them ideal directing groups for the delivery of NP cargoes. It is therefore unsurprising that Ab-NP conjugates have found widespread utility in the biomedical field. 275, 339, 12, [340] [341] [342] The ability of Abs to neutralise the effect of their target or to induce a favourable biological response allows their use as therapeutic agents in their own right. They have also commonly been exploited to deliver a therapeutic cargo, in the form of an Ab-drug conjugate (ADC). 343, 344, 10, 345 At the start of 2017, 52 monoclonal Ab technologies were in clinical trials, with a further 16 awaiting or having been granted marketing approval. 346 The importance of tumour delivery is highlighted by the fact that 40 % of these systems were targeted towards cancer therapy. The generation of Abs for a target protein, cell type or tissue of interest is outside the scope of this review, and the reader is directed instead to a number of comprehensive reviews for further details. 275, 347, 348 Most Abs are composed of 4 chains (2 light and 2 heavy) each of which has a constant and a variable region. Specificity towards the desired target is generated predominantly by the variable region. Ab fragments may therefore retain binding affinity of the full length construct, though in some cases bisantigen binding is necessary to maintain full affinity. These smaller targeting groups can be produced via genetic engineering or careful protease-mediated Ab digestion, generating motifs which overcome the disruptive size, potential immunogenicity, and high cost of the parent Ab. 342 Both full length and fragment Abs have been extensively used to target the delivery of NP cargoes, as have naturally occurring single domain camelid Abs. 349 Tumours have been particularly widely targeted due to the frequency with which cell-surface receptors are overexpressed and can thus be used as a site for selective delivery. 12 The most common realisations of Ab-NP strategies deliver a therapeutic payload via a liposomal drugdelivery vehicle, though other NP formats for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes have also been the subject of significant interest. 342 Overexpression of HER2 is implicated in over 30 % of breast cancers and thus represents an important target for delivery. 350 The HER2 selective Ab trastuzumab (sold under the tradename Herceptin) and other related structures are probably the most widely studied and utilised targeting groups for NP delivery. In a series of early papers, Park and co-workers demonstrated that the labelling of liposomes with an anti-HER2 Ab resulted in an efficient delivery vehicle for targeting breast cancer xenografts with chemotherapeutics or DNA. [351] [352] [353] HER2 targeted iron oxide NPs have also been widely reported as a means to induce directed hyperthermia and for MRI imaging (Figure 19 ). [354] [355] [356] [357] [358] [359] [360] NDong et al recently reported that a single antigen-binding fragment of trastuzumab could also be used for targeting in vivo, leading to effective delivery of iron oxide particles to tumour sites. 359 The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is another popular target for Ab-mediated delivery. EGFR overexpression is implicated in many cancers, especially those with epithelial origins, and thus serves as a useful target for immunoliposome targeting. [361] [362] [363] Indeed, a single antigen-binding fragment of the monoclonal Ab cetuximab conjugated to doxorubicin loaded liposomes has been tested in phase I clinical trials for the treatment of patients with solid malignancies. 362 The choice of Ab, the use of full length protein or fragment, and the NP cargo are all important considerations when designing an Ab-labelled technology. However, the widespread interest in Ab-NP conjugates has led to the identification of a number of other key design criteria. The orientation of the Ab on the NP surface is an important considerationnon-specific protein modification techniques can lead to Ab conjugates with many different NP binding points, some of which may result in an antigen-binding domain that is positioned in a hindered or blocked orientation. Indeed, a recent study by Herda et al demonstrated that as little as 5 % grafted protein possessed an accessible epitope following non-specific conjugation to silica NPs. 374 The use of site-specific modification strategies able to selectively form Ab-NP conjugates away from the active recognition site are likely to improve the efficiency of NP targeting in vivo. 342, 375 To this extent, Greene et al recently reported a strategy to functionally re-bridge distal disulphide bonds within a trastuzumab fragment-Ab, enabling orientated Ab display on the surface of PLGA-PEG NPs and a corresponding increase in binding efficiency when compared to non-specific Ab conjugation. 376 In a related manner, the Ab loading density on the NP surface can play an important role in targeting efficiency. At high levels, hindered antigen-binding may result leading to an initially counter-intuitive drop in targeting efficiency. Indeed, Jiang et al demonstrated that the size of the NP template plays an important role in determining hindrance and thus binding efficiency, with increasing curvature leading to an increase in separation and thus decrease in steric inhibition of antigen recognition. 377 Although multi-valent Ab display may be desirable in some cases in order to promote receptor recognition, recent papers by the groups of Davis and Prosperi have highlighted that this may not always be the case. 378, 379 In both cases, a singly Ab labelled NP was found to be sufficient, and in the case of Colombo et al superior to multivalent Ab display for effective tumour targeting.
 Many biological entities fall within the nanometre size regime, displaying multi-valent peptide or protein motifs on their surface. NP-polypeptide conjugates are able to effectively mimic the behaviour of these structures, stimulating signalling pathways and eliciting cellular responses. The interactions induced by these particles are responsible for many of the applications discussed in this review. The promotion of receptor clustering is often implicated in receptor-mediated endocytosis and cell or tissue penetration, 380, 381 and NP targeting may be enhanced by multi-valent interactions at the nanoscale. As these topics have already been covered in detail above, in this section we will focus on the ability of NPpolypeptide constructs to mimic the multi-valent display of antigens present on the surfaces of pathogens and tumour cells. By doing so these conjugates are able to induce a controlled immune response and thus generate immunity in the recipient. Technologies which rely on the encapsulation, rather than surface presentation of antigens, are outside the scope of this review and the reader is instead directed to a number of comprehensive reviews on this topic. 382-384 Furthermore, the use of self-assembling peptides/protein NPs as vaccine candidates will be detailed in section 8 below and so will also not be discussed in detail here. NP vaccines can offer the benefits of increasing antigen stability over soluble delivery. Furthermore, their nanoscale size may promote scavenging by dendritic cells and therefore improve T-cell presentation, minimising the activation of alternative immune response pathways. 382, 385 Reddy et al demonstrated that when NPs were of a sufficiently small size (< 100 nm) preferential drainage and accumulation in the lymph nodes was enabled. 386 However, other reports have suggested that particles up to 1 μm in diameter may also preferentially accumulate under certain delivery conditions, highlighting the need for further investigation into this phenomena. 387 Preferential exploitation of the lymphatic system brings particles into closer contact with the residing dendritic cells and leads to an enhanced activation of the immune system maximising vaccine efficiency. However, the major advantage of NP-based vaccines lies in their ability to enable the multivalent display of antigens, promoting the interaction of multiple ligand-receptor pairs. Such processes often play an essential role during T-cell activation, rather than relying on individual recognition events. 388 As such, the presentation of multiple antigens on the NP surface can play a far more effective role in modulating the immune response than presentation of free peptide or protein motifs. Interestingly, it has been shown that the antigen patterning plays a crucial role during activation. As a result, antigen grafting is a key design feature during the production of NP vaccines. The Yu group demonstrated that enhanced antigen clustering elicits a stronger immune response than uniformly distributed ligands at both the micron and nano scale. 388, 389 Similarly, particle surfaces that closely mimic the natural context of the antigen, such as liposomes able to mimic cell membranes, have been found to improve activation efficiency. 390, 391 Amongst the NPs used for synthetic vaccines, 'hard' NPs have generally been more widely applied for the surface presentation of biomimetic peptide/protein antigens. In contrast, 'soft' particles able to encapsulate a payload have commonly been utilised for the delivery of antigen following particle recognition and subsequent release. 384 AuNPs in particular have found widespread use as NP antigen carriers due to their ease of surface functionalisation, high surface-area, biocompatibility, and tunable size. 392 Importantly, recent research suggests that AuNPs may also act as size-and shape-dependent adjuvants, stimulating the immune system and enhancing antigen recognition. 393, 394 As a result, the attachment of peptide and protein ligands to AuNPs has emerged as an effective means to stimulate the production of Abs against a wide range of pathologies and pathogens, including malaria, 395 foot and mouth disease, 396, 397 the Yersinia pestis bacteria responsible for plague, 398 cancers via the mucin-1 (MUC-1) glycoprotein, 399,400 influenza A virus, 401 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 402 respiratory syncytial virus, 403 encephalitis causing viruses, 404 and HIV via gp120 derived peptides 405 .
 Both single-and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have also been widely explored as antigen carriers due to their largely biologically inert nature, facile surface modification, and ability to induce cell penetration. However, recent reports on their toxicity may limit further development towards applications in patients. 406 Since being first introduced by Pantarotto et al, 407 peptide-and protein-modified CNTs have been utilised to generate immune responses against a range of antigens including tumour lysate, 408 Plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen-1 derived peptide, 409 Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein derivatives, 410 Wilm's tumour antigen, 411 and foot and mouth virus derived antigens 412 . 'Hard' NPs such as polystyrene nano-beads, 413, 414 polyacrylate dendrimers, 415 and calcium phosphate particles 416, 417 have all also been shown to enable Ab generation in vivo. The Baneyx group have recently reported that a calcium phosphate binding peptide epitope can be attached to the termini of the desired antigen, inducing biomineralization and particle assembly at a late stage of the formulation process. 416, 417 By doing so, the low stability of calcium phosphate particles can be mitigated, allowing 'on-demand' production and application to take place. Although 'soft' organic NPs have been more rarely used for the formulation of vaccines, a number of examples exist and in many cases they reveal interesting facets of vaccine design that should be carefully considered, regardless of the particle type. For example, liposome formulations have been commonly utilised for the encapsulation of peptide or protein antigens, enabling delivery to immune cells typically following targeted delivery. Virosomes, liposomes functionalised with virus components (often influenza virus derived) able to mimic viral envelopes, have been particularly widely used as safe, self-adjuvanted, and stable antigen delivery vehicles. 418,419 However, Guan et al have demonstrated that the surfacepresentation of ligands within liposome formulations is able to mediate activation of alternative branches of the immune system in vivo, when compared to encapsulated antigen. 420 Careful NP design is therefore key in ensuring that the desired response is triggered. Similarly, peptide-lipid amphiphiles have also been studied, as discussed in section 8, for their ability to self-assemble into peptide-decorated micelles. The use of peptides as a key structural component results in an extremely high density of surface antigen coverage, enhancing recognition and activation efficiency. 421 Importantly, the crowded environment provided by such a set-up has been found to induce peptides to adopt a secondary structure more akin to their natural presentation within the parent protein. 415, 422 As a result, the Abs generated downstream are better able to produce an effective response when subsequently challenged. While applications using peptide-and protein-NP conjugates as vaccines to stimulate a protective immune response to previously unencountered antigens have been most widely studied, technologies which modulate the immune system, and in particular mitigate auto-immunity, have begun to emerge. In a healthy individual, tolerance of self-antigens is maintained by the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Modulation of Treg activity and addressing deficiencies is thus an attractive target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. 423 Tsai et al demonstrated that the presentation of recombinant major histocompatibility complexes bearing type 1-diabetes associated peptides on the surface of iron oxide NPs resulted in the in vivo expansion of Tregs, and ultimately the restoration of normoglycemia in diabetic mice. 424 Furthermore, the co-delivery of myelin peptides, known to be targeted by auto-immune responses in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis, with tolerogenic small molecules that stimulate Treg proliferation on the surface of AuNPs, has subsequently been shown to suppress symptoms within mouse models of the disease. 425 More recently, Hess et al utilised QDs as a scaffold for the display of myelin peptides allowing the authors to monitor the distribution and activated pathways of the NP-peptide complexes in vivo. 426 
 In much of this review, we have focussed on systems in which the peptide or protein defines or modulates NP function or performance. In addition to these roles, peptide/proteins have emerged as key structural motifs, which are integral to the formation as well as eventual end application of the NP. Indeed, in many of the scenarios to be discussed in this section the particle is composed entirely of peptide or protein components. Peptide self-assembly into complex nano-architectures can be instigated by a combination of intra-and inter-molecular non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions, and π-π stacking. 427 Although individually these interactions may be weak, cumulatively they are able to define the secondary and tertiary structures of complex native protein architectures, and can be exploited to produce a vast array of self-assembled structures on both the nano-and micro-scale. The formation of architectures, ranging from fibres and tubes, through to vesicles and micelles, and on to more elaborate structures such as crystals and donuts can all be instigated. [427] [428] [429] [430] [431] While the fundamental driving forces behind the formation of a particular architecture are becoming increasingly well understood, in many cases the route of assembly remains a dynamic process which can be affected by seemingly minor modifications of peptide primary structure or growth conditions. [432] [433] [434] [435] [436] The formation of self-assembled peptide architectures has found widespread application across the biomedical field, and further afield in the wider materials research community. Here, we will focus on the formation of 3D spherical NPs, particularly peptide/protein micelles and vesicles. The conditions for the formation of these structures are often strict, requiring precise control over composition, assembly conditions, and handling. For an in depth overview of the wider field, and in particular the use of selfassembling peptides in the formation of 2D nano-fibres, hydrogels, and nanotubes, the reader is referred to excellent recent reviews on the subject. 427, 429, 430, [437] [438] [439] [440] It should be noted that we will not cover nanosized aggregates of globular proteins in this review, such as those formed by serum albumins or gelatin, which have found increasing clinical use in recent years. Such systems do not rely on the specific selfassembly of polypeptide components, and thus fall outside the scope of this review. A number of reviews focussed on these topics have recently been published. 441-444
 Dipeptides represent the simplest self-assembling peptide motif. Since the breakthrough discovery by Reches and Gazit that di-phenylalanine assembled into nanotubes at high concentrations, 445 a wide-range of nano-architectures have been reported, making use of both natural and non-natural amino acids. 446 Often, the presence of a di-aromatic motif is vital, providing the driving force for assembly via π-π stacking. The ease with which dipeptides can be accessed synthetically makes them particularly attractive structures for biomedical applications, with researchers from diverse backgrounds able to exploit their use.
 The first dipeptide shown to form spherical particles was the unnatural structure di-phenylglycine, in stark contrast to the nanotubes formed by the closely related di-phenylalanine. 447 The significance of seemingly minor differences and subtle changes in structure highlight the surprising versatility of such simple structures. The situation is further complicated by the dynamic nature of dipeptide nanostructures, which have been observed to result in reversible transitions between architectures in response to stimuli or incubation conditions. 446, 448, 449 Despite this apparent plasticity, dipeptide NPs exhibit remarkable stability. Indeed, di-phenylglycine particles were shown to be stable to both acid and base treatment with no observed change in particle number. 447 Despite the simplicity of dipeptides assemblies, their application in biomedicine has been limited to just a few reports. In an early example, Alam et al demonstrated that H2N-methionine-dehydrophenylalanine-CO2H NPs could be loaded with the anti-cancer drug curcumin and used to induce tumour regression in a mouse melanoma model. 450 Importantly the unnatural amino acid dehydrophenylalanine not only increased packing efficiency, and thus enhanced physical stability through increased π-π stacking, but also promoted biological stability by providing protease resistance. More recently, Fan et al reported the assembly of H2N-tryptophan-phenylalanine-CO2H, to produce fluorescent NPs. 451 By combining π-π stacking with peptide-zinc interactions they were able to produce particles with visible light emission, mimicking the red-shifted emission exhibited by fluorescent proteins upon metal-binding. Subsequent modification of the particle surface with a MUC-1 binding aptamer enabled biocomptability to be enhanced when compared to other fluorescent NPs such as quantum dots. 451 Although this promising system has only so far been demonstrated in vitro, it offers an attractive means through which to produce simple, photo-stable, biocompatible NPs for in vivo imaging in the future.
 Amphiphilic peptides, containing both a hydrophobic and hydrophilic domain, can be broadly split into three categories: i) Those composed only of native amino acids (with or without minor modifications at the termini); ii) Those containing unnatural amino acids; and iii) Lipid-or polymer-conjugated peptide hybrids. In all three groups, self-assembly into spherical particles is typically driven by a mixture of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, with the formation of secondary structures possible in some cases. 427, 431 The formation of nano-vesicles composed entirely of native amino acids, referred to in some instances as 'peptosomes', was first reported by Vauthey et al. 452 1 or 2 C-terminal aspartic acid residues, bearing 2 or 3 negative charges respectively, were found to be sufficient to drive the assembly of an N-capped hydrophobic peptide chain of 6 alanine, valine, or leucine residues. Dynamic heterogenous mixtures of nano-tubes, vesicles, and micelles were observed, depending on the exact peptide sequence. Subsequent reports on the formation of vesicles from glycine-tail anionic peptides 453 or cationic peptides bearing lysine or histidine termini 432, 433 validated this approach, with the hydrophobic 'tail' and charged 'head' group in effect mimicking the structure of lipid surfactants. Interestingly, it has recently been reported that rather than forming tail-to-tail arrangements analogous to those observed in lipid membranes, the hydrophobic regions of amphiphilic peptides form interdigitated β-strand-like assemblies, leading to greatly reduced membrane thickness. 454 Despite these important fundamental studies on the ability of short amphiphilic native-peptides to form vesicles, biomedical applications have to date been limited by the relative instability of self-assembled constructs. Linear peptides typically exhibit high critical aggregation concentrations (CACs) in aqueous solution, below which particle formation does not occur, and a dynamic equilibrium with free peptide therefore often exists. This situation is further complicated in complex biological fluid. [433] [434] [435] A number of different approaches have been taken to address this issue, yet often CACs or dissociation constants are not reported, obscuring the analysis of particle stability. Gudlar et al showed that branched peptides derived from natural transmembrane helices can enhance vesicle stability as a result of enhanced hydrophobic interactions. 455 These branched structure were found to be a key driving force for the preferential formation of vesicles over fibres, closely mimicking the di-hydrophobic tail of native lipids and enabling the delivery of cargoes to cells in vitro. In order to stabilise vesicles post-formation, van Hell et al incorporated cysteine residues into the primary structure of the amphiphilic peptide SA2. 456, 457 SA2 is a rationally-designed amphiphilic sequence containing sequential hydrophobic residues of decreasing bulk, leading to a cone-shaped monomer that promotes the formation of spherical architectures, with a CAC of 0.5 μM prior to crosslinking. 434 The formation of interchain disulphide linkages between adjacent cysteines led to the production of stable vesicles, and enabled cellular delivery of encapsulated photosensitizers. 457 An alternative approach to stabilise self-assembled peptide architectures is to incorporate non-native functionalities. In its simplest form, this can involve the incorporation of unnatural amino acids, as reported by Tanisaka et al, providing increased hydrophobic interactions as well as resistance to proteases in vivo. 458 Stable vesicles composed of hydrophilic sarcosine and hydrophobic methyl glutamate residues were shown to accumulate in cancer tissue as a result of the EPR effect in animal xenografts. Taking this concept further, the formation of lipid-or polymer-hybrid peptides has become an attractive means by which to drive peptide self-assembly. 459, 460 Liu et al demonstrated that addition of cholesterol to the end of a hydrophilic hexaarginine-TAT peptide block drove micelle formation (CAC = 10.1 μM). 193 These structures were able to preferentially disrupt bacterial cell membranes and thus act as antimicrobial agents in vivo, though it is important to note that host haemolysis is a likely side-effect at higher concentrations. Similarly, Lv et al have shown that triblock PEG-polyphenylalanine-polyglutamic acid polymer-peptide hybrids are able to form stable stealth nanoparticles, for the delivery of encapsulated doxorubicin to tumours (CAC = 2.6 μM). 461 Upon glutamic acid protonation in the increasingly acidic environment of maturing endosomes, disassembly and subsequent cargo release led to tumour apoptosis.
 As an extension to the use of linear peptide amphiphiles, higher order, repetitively branched peptide dendrimers with increased bulk and a unique globular architecture have also found utility. On their own, dendrimers do not typically interact sufficiently to form stable self-assembled structures. In a series of papers the Gu group have developed an elegant solution to this barrier, through the use of a cooperative self-assembly process. Hydrophilic polylysine dendrimers are first electrostatically bound to a linear hydrophobic peptide bearing a negatively charged C-terminal glutamate residue. This amphiphilic, supramolecular dendrimer can then further self-assemble into nano-sized micelles, capable of encapsulating a hydrophobic drug or DNA cargo. 462 Under weakly acidic endosomal conditions following uptake, glutamate protonation leads to disassembly of the nanostructure, and release of the cargo. 463 These dendritic systems have been used to successfully deliver the anti-tumour drug doxorubicin in vivo through passive targeting, 464 and more recently to allow directed delivery by exploiting the modularity of dendrimer assembly to enable surface functionalisation. 465 
 Along with β-sheets, α-helices are the most common secondary structures adopted by polypeptides. Hydrogen bonding between the backbone amide oxygens and the N-H bond 4 residues away induces a right-handed helical structure in which the amino acid sidechains are directed away from the core. Further stabilisation can be achieved through the subsequent assembly of multiple peptides to form coiled-coil motifs, whereby multiple helices wrap around each other into a superhelical bundle. 466 Assembly is driven first by the exclusion of hydrophobic residues form the aqueous exterior, and then stabilised and enhanced by inter-strand electrostatic interactions between polar and charged amino acids. 467 The resultant assemblies offer a powerful means to produce complex bioactive materials that have found use across a range of disciplines. 466, [468] [469] [470] Coiled-coil peptides were first used in the nanotechnology field by Stevens et al to drive the assembly of AuNPs into higher order aggregates. 471 The formation and application of NPs composed entirely of coiled-coil peptide structures was subsequently driven by the group of Burkhard. In 2006 they reported the rational structure-based design of a linear peptide, composed of the pentameric repeat forming coiledcoil domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) 472 , and a de novo designed peptide that formed a self-assembled trimer. This peptide was able to undergo self-assembly into regular, polyhedral NPs, and display multiple copies of a bioactive species on the particle surface. 473 As described in section 7, such a display is capable of effectively mimicking pathogen antigen presentation. Coiled-coil NPs have subsequently therefore been demonstrated to act as novel immunogens for the production of vaccines, for diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 474 malaria, 475 and HIV 476, 477 (Figure 20) . Further developments which enhance NP stability, including the addition of lipid tails, 477, 478 and the formation of elastin-like peptide hybrids (as discussed below), 327 have additionally been reported, bringing CACs into the low nM range. Importantly, the coiled-coil core has been shown to only be weakly immunogenic itself. As a result, Abs generated against these NPs are predominantly targeted towards the displayed antigen, though low titres against the particle have also reportedly been generated. 476, 478, 479 
 The non-viral delivery of DNA or RNA to cells is a powerful emerging technique for the treatment of disease. A number of treatments based around the delivery of plasmid DNA, or antisense, silencing, or micro RNAs are currently in the clinic, with an even greater number undergoing advanced clinical trials. [480] [481] [482] [483] Positively-charged peptides, able to self-assemble into compact NPs with negatively charged nucleic acids, are particularly attractive. By exploiting the research discussed throughout this review, peptide vectors have been shown to protect the DNA/RNA cargo from damage, enable targeting of the desired cell type, and perhaps most importantly facilitate intracellular delivery and endosomal escape, as described in section 5. 484 Indeed, the same cationic residues that enable NP formation, such as lysine and arginine, are also those able to promote cell penetration. Wu and Wu were amongst the first to report peptide-nucleic acid NP mediated gene delivery. Complexes of plasmid DNA and polylysine were shown to efficiently deliver their cargo to cells in vitro. 485, 486 Many subsequent reports have focussed on the ability of peptide-nucleic acid complexes to transfect isolated cells, rather than being applied in vivo. This is in part due to the trade-off between the toxicity associated with longer cationic peptides, and the low particle stability when shorter sequences are used instead. 487 Stabilisation through both dialdehyde crosslinking 487 and disulfide formation 488, 489 has been reported, however the most common means of enabling in vivo application is the use of more complex peptide substrates capable of lowering CACs sufficiently to overcome these problems. In an early example, Rittner et al replaced acidic residues in the amphiphilic cell-penetrating peptide JTS1 with cationic lysines or arginines, producing a sequence able to both condense DNA and promote efficient systemic transfection in vivo. 490 Other peptides, such as MPG, 491 RALA (an arginine-rich analogue of the more commonly utilised endosomal escape peptide GALA), 492 and amphiphilic arginine-containing triblock peptides 493 have all found use for the in vivo delivery of nucleic acid cargos. More recently, the Kaplan 494 and Zheng 495 groups have reported the targeted delivery of peptide-nucleic acid NPs, via the introduction of a tumour-specific homing peptide ( Figure 21 ). In both cases, preferential accumulation and subsequent nucleic acid delivery in the tumour tissue was achieved following intravenous injection. This was observed to prevent the potential side-effects that can occur as a result of systemic transfection. 
 Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are biosynthesised polymeric-peptide repeats, typically of the pentameric sequence (VPGXG)n, where X and n can be varied to ultimately determine the properties of a particular ELP construct. All ELPs possess an 'inverse transition temperature' (Tt), above which they undergo a sharp phase transition from a highly solvated peptide monomer to a desolvated aggregate. 496, 497 The exact properties are determined by the so-called 'guest-residue', with hydrophobic residues leading to a decrease in Tt, and conversely, hydrophilic residues leading to a corresponding increase. The aggregation of ELPs can be exploited to form spherical, nano-sized cargo-delivery vehicles via a number of different strategies. The simplest realisation of such technologies relies on the passive accumulation of soluble ELP monomers within tumours via the EPR effect. Through suitable design of the sequence, Tt can be modulated to be slightly higher than body temperature. Peptide self-assembly can then be driven at the site of interest through the application of localised hyperthermia. [498] [499] [500] During this process, NP assemblies are first formed which are able to promote cellular uptake, followed by the subsequent formation of larger aggregates which lead to retention at the site of heating. 500 Importantly, such strategies require a precise control over the concentration of systemically-injected ELPs -too high, and off-target aggregation can result, too low, and no assembly will be observed upon heating. 501 In spite of this sensitivity, the hyperthermia induced assembly of ELP NPs can still be used enhance the activity of attached drugs such as doxorubicin, promoting both retention and uptake at the site of heat application. 502 The use of amphiphilic ELP structures that can form stable micelles above the Tt has more recently been reported, bringing CACs into the high nM-low μM range. In an early example, Dreher et al demonstrated that the attachment of hydrophobic doxorubicin (through an endosome cleavable hydrazone bond) could itself drive micelle formation. 503 MacKay et al subsequently showed that by tuning Tt, stable structures with low CACs could be generated and used to effectively treat tumours in vivo ( Figure 22 ). 504, 505 As an alternative, the formation of diblock ELP polymer can be used to drive assembly, with each block possessing a unique Tt. When the temperature is above the Tt of the first block but beneath that of the second, micelle formation will occur, which can be further stabilised by the introduction of disulphide crosslinkers. 506 ELP-based NPs have been applied in a number of applications in recent years. In addition to early reports on drug-delivery, ELPs have subsequently been utilised as NIR fluorescent imaging agents, 507 microPET contrast agents, 508 and synthetic vaccines 509 . Furthermore, the attachment of multi-valent tumour targeting sequences, 510 cell-penetrating peptides, 511,512 and pH-responsive ELP cores 513 have all been seen to enhance the applicability of ELP-nanostructures in biomedicine.
 Casein is the collective term for a family of phosphorylated proteins commonly found in milk. These proteins have a well-defined, hydrophilic N-terminal domain, and a hydrophobic C-terminal domain, creating a structure that can in essence be viewed as an amphiphilic diblock copolymer. 514 Unlike other proteins which may form globular aggregates, caseins are able to undergo controlled self-assembly to form stable micelle-like structures in aqueous solution with a CAC of 20-80 μM. 515 This is particularly true, when individual casein family members, most notably β-casein, are used in isolation rather than as the naturally occurring mixture. 515 Casein micelles have recently been the subject of increasing interest, as naturally occurring nano-delivery vehicles for a range of hydrophobic cargoes. The use of casein NPs to improve the bioavailability of supplemented vitamin D, prior to release following protease action in the stomach, has been the subject of human clinical trials. 516 Similarly, the delivery of hydrophobic therapeutics, particularly for the treatment of stomach cancers, has been widely studied by the Livney group. 515,517-519 Finally, the tumour accumulation of intravenously injected, cisplatin containing casein-micelles has been shown to result in improvements in therapeutic outcome in vivo (Figure 23 ). 520 These promising early reports, coupled to the ease of use, inexpensive production, bio-degradable, non-toxic and non-immunogenic nature of casein micelles makes them particularly appealing as delivery-vehicles. It is likely that the coming years will see such structures finding increasing utility in biomedicine. 
 NP biosensing complexes offer a powerful means by which to detect and monitor disease, and to understand pathological conditions. This is usually achieved using optically active NPs, though other sensing modalities can also be utilised. 33 The most common sensing platforms rely on a change in optical properties in the presence of the desired analyte or biomarker, or selective binding of a NP complex within a 'detection-region'. 521, 522 Peptides and proteins are vital components of such systems, inducing NP binding or mediating a responsive output to the presence of the desired analyte. NP biosensors are most widely utilised for the ex vivo analysis of biofluids, as epitomised by the use of anti-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) antibody coated AuNPs in commercially available lateral flow pregnancy tests. 523 The development of NP-based biosensors has become a vast field of research, and a detailed overview of ex vivo technologies is outside the scope of this review. The reader is instead referred to a number of excellent comprehensive reviews on the topic for further details. 33, [524] [525] [526] [527] Instead, we will here focus on the far smaller body of literature that focusses on the application of NP-biosensors in vivo, and the challenges that have so far limited their widespread implementation. Such systems allow the true complexity of tissues to be captured in a way that in vitro testing of biofluids cannot provide. 528 Sensing complexes provide a means to interrogate biological systems and probe differences in activity and temporal distributions of a desired analyte, as opposed to the spatial localisation provided by imaging modalities. Rather than being detected within a specific area, in vivo sensors offer a responsive platform to monitor small molecules, biomacromolecules, and diseased states in a continuous manner. 528, 529 Although implanted electrochemical sensors have been widely described, in particular for the monitoring of blood glucose levels, problems with induced fibrosis and foreign body responses can limit sensitivity and accuracy. 528 NP based systems offer a viable alternative, but also have their own complicationsin addition to the challenges of generating a signal that can be actively transduced for detection, NPs must overcome background signal generation within the complex environment of the body, be retained at the desired site of detection, and ideally provide a reversible and dynamic response. The use of peptide/protein-NP conjugates in particular must address the sensitivity of biological components to degradation, clearance, and unfavourable interactions. 529 As a result, systems in which peptides and proteins play an active sensing role, rather than mediating imaging or targeting, have only recently begun to emerge. In one realisation of such technologies, environmentally sensitive polymer NPs have been exploited to detect differences in analyte concentration as a result of conjugated enzyme activity. More specifically, polymer NPs incorporating platinum based fluorescent sensors have been shown to display phosphorescence dependent on environmental oxygen concentrations. Cash and Clark demonstrated that by conjugation of the histamine-metabolising, oxygen-consuming enzyme diamine oxidase to the NP surface, biologically relevant levels of this key inflammatory-and neuro-modulator could be detected by a change in phosphorence. 530 This response was reversible upon diffusion of oxygen back into the biological milieu, with only a limited dropoff in polymer dynamic range observed upon repeated applications. Similarly, Sun et al monitored glucose levels in vivo using a glucose oxidase-functionalised oxygen-polymer NP transducer. 531 Subcutaneous implantation enabled retention of the particles for up to a month, enabling reproducible signal generation over this extended period.
 As an alternative, the Bhatia group has pioneered the use of protease-sensitive NP coatings, which release peptide cleavage products into the urine upon enzymatic activity in vivo. In their original report, Kwong et al conjugated peptides sensitive to a range of common proteases onto the surface of iron oxide nanoworms. 532 Due to their size, these particles were blocked from renal clearance and displayed accumulation in the liver. However, following protease activity, the peptide cleavage products were excreted in the urine, and could subsequently be detected by mass spectrometry, giving a panel-readout of in vivo protease levels. Subsequent iterations of this technology have demonstrated the detection of thrombosis and colorectal cancer using peptides terminated with recognition elements that can subsequently be detected in urine by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, or point-of-care lateral flow detection systems. 533, 534 In order to overcome the challenges presented by non-specific activation by circulating proteases, Dudani et al reported the use of photo-protected peptide-NP coatings which could be activated towards protease sensitivity with spatial and temporal control, following the application of UV or two-photon light. 535 Furthermore, the sub-cutaneous implantation of 8 nm peptide-functionalised PEG-NPs, which enable gradual leaching of a particle reservoir into the blood stream, has recently been shown to allow the continuous monitoring of protease activity in vivo, although detection was still limited to a 24 hr time period. 535 
 The past 20 years have seen a rapid increase in the development of nanotechnologies, and the exploitation of polypeptides in this context has also found increasing favour. The structural and functional versatility of peptides and proteins allows them to play an important role in modulating, instigating, and defining the activity of NP constructs. In this review we have outlined the key roles played by polypeptide coatings and structural components, and demonstrated how they can be utilised to improve the efficacy of NP tools in biomedical applications. In many cases, both peptides and proteins can fulfil the desired function. Each offers important advantages over the other (though exceptions to these generalisations exist) that should be carefully considered during NP-conjugate design ( Figure 24 ). For example, the ease with which peptides can be produced via solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) is highly beneficial. As well as offering cost-effective, quick, and scalable production, the versatility of SPPS enables unnatural chemical space to be explored. As such, the facile introduction of reactive handles and protease resistant residues, or structures able to promote biological interactions, is enabled (Figure 24b and c) . Furthermore, the small size of peptides enables the disruption of NP hydrodynamic diameter and detrimental effects on activity to be minimised, while creating a dense, accessible, and flexible coverage of active sequences (Figure 24a and d). In contrast, the increased structural complexity offered by proteins enables NP-conjugates to typically attain increased activity and recognition, albeit potentially at the cost of decreased biological stability and increased recognition by the reticuloendothelial system (Figure 24e ). In addition, small structural modifications to proteins are usually well tolerated, without leading to major disruptions in activity. Corresponding changes in peptide sequence have a stronger influence on conformation and activity, potentially leading to a significant drop in the efficacy of the nanotechnology (Figure 24g ). The situation is further complicated by the complex interplay between peptide/protein components and the particular NP core, cargo, application, and delivery route. As such, consideration of the precise polypeptide component is a vital step during NP-conjugate design. Despite the advances that have been made in enabling effective and targeted delivery to the desired site of action, providing an integral means to maintain activity, and acting to hijack and exploit native biological pathways, there remains significant scope for the improvement of polypeptide-NP technologies. In a recent editorial, Leroux highlighted that while the number of papers reporting increasingly creative and complex NP systems increases exponentially, their therapeutic translation remains disappointing, highlighting the challenges faced by the nanotechnology field. 536 Within the realm of peptide/protein-NP conjugates, we believe that addressing the following issues is vital to enable translation of these naïve systems to a biomedical setting:
 i) The use of native amino acids brings with it the threat of protease sensitivity, and activity can often be rapidly lost in the complex environments faced in vivo. In this review, a number of approaches have been introduced towards addressing these difficulties. Unnatural amino acids are particularly effective, providing peptide bonds which are not recognised and processed by native enzymes. This is most easily achieved with synthetic peptides, as discussed above -relatively simple modifications such as N-methylation, enantio-or retro-enantio amino acids, or extended βor γlinkages can be introduced. 217,537,538 While increased stability is harder to achieve with protein substrates, the advent of technologies which allow the introduction of non-natural stabilising residues, 539,540 the addition of protective polymer coatings, 541, 542 or the formation of additional cross-links 543, 544 are now allowing such issues to be addressed. In order to fully facilitate the translation of NP-based systems, it is important that the research community begins to actively embrace such technologies. ii) The small size of peptides allows them to form compact NP coatings, which lead to minimal disruption of desired function. They are therefore often the preferred choice when designing a NP-polypeptide conjugate, with the major drawback being reduced bioactivity (Figure 24a and e). Nature has had millions of years to slowly evolve proteins with complex 3D structures and potent activity, and it remains challenging for designed, screened, or derived peptides to fully recapitulate this. Nowhere is this more strongly felt than in the reduced ability of short synthetic peptides (< 30 amino acids) to target and bind a particular protein or cell type when compared to Abs or other binding proteins. Although strongly binding long peptides such as affibodies (> 50 amino acids) can be accessed synthetically, more typically they are produced recombinantly and still result in a bulky coating on the NP surface. 545 There is a therefore a pressing need for technologies which can bring short peptide binding affinities down from the μM to the nM range. 546 Recent advances in the screening, design, and exploitation of bicyclic peptides are enabling such levels to be reached, and will surely be exploited in the near future to enhance the ability of NPtargeting strategies to achieve their goals. [547] [548] [549] iii) The bioactivity of a peptide or protein-NP conjugate is highly dependent on achieving an appropriate and accessible orientation of the bioactive domain. Again, this can be easier to achieve using peptides rather than protein substrates -tethering residues can be easily introduced at the termini during solid phase peptide synthesis. Often protein substrates are attached either by non-specific conjugation techniques or simple adsorption, leading to a detrimental loss of structure, heterogenous coatings, and steric hindrance of the active site. 375 It is essential that recent developments in the field of site-specific or selective protein modification are exploited to overcome these problems, to enable the controlled orientation of proteins on the NP surface. Strategies for genetically or chemically manipulating proteins to introduce and exploit uniquely reactive natural and non-natural amino acids, or to incorporate hexahistidine and other affinity tags, are becoming increasingly widespread and offer powerful tools to the biomedical research community. 342, 550, 551 iv) Many of the applications for peptide/protein-NP conjugates discussed in this review rely on processes that are still poorly understood at a fundamental level. Controversy still exists about the precise mechanisms by which peptides mediate transport across biological barriers, 145 coatings and particle components which were previously thought to be biologically inert are becoming increasingly found to induce an immunological response, 66 and the design criteria required to produce stable self-assembled polypeptide NPs are still being developed 436 . In order to provide NP technologies that meet the challenging demands of biomedical applications it is important that these topics, and many others within the field, continue to be investigated and that a deeper understanding of the intertwined complexities that determine NP fate is provided. v) Proper and standardised characterisation of NP-peptide/protein conjugates is essential to not only allow progression in the field, but to enable regulatory and clinical standards to be met. 172 This challenge must be addressed by both the development of new tools which are able to reflect the true nature of NP complexes, as well as increased uptake by researchers of existing technologies, and a more thorough approach to NP characterisation being taken. 552, 553 At present, many systems reported in the literature are inadequately characterised, leading to large discrepancies in results, conflicting reports, and incorrect interpretations that subsequently propagate throughout the field. The inherent complexity of NPbioconjugates makes them undoubtedly challenging to studyeven what appears a simple measurement such as the concentration of particles in solution is often difficult. 172 This becomes even more significant for more complex calculations such as the density or orientation of a protein on a NP surface, or the origins of biological effects arising from heterogeneous samples. However, novel tools that can answer these questions are beginning to emerge, and although often highly specialised, are beginning to be readily accessible to researchers, through national and international facilities for NP research and characterisation. [553] [554] [555] [556] A big leap towards enabling the clinical translation of many peptide/protein-NP conjugate technologies will be taken as the biomedical community addresses these issues. As a result, our ability to treat, diagnose, and understand disease will be greatly enhanced, and allow nano-technology to fulfil its undoubted promise in the biomedical sciences.",fa28e1fd6d07ba6f081f33eae1a18247e89456cc,2018-01-01,"Spicer, Christopher D.; Jumeaux, Coline; Gupta, Bakul; Stevens, Molly M.",Chemical Society Reviews,10.1039/c7cs00877e,Chemical Society Reviews,432.0,True,"Viruses of the family Coronaviridae possess a singlestrand, positive-sense RNA genome ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length. 1 For example, an HKU2related coronavirus of bat origin was responsible for a fatal acute diarrhoea syndrome in pigs in 2018. 12, 13 We report the epidemiological data of nine inpatients, from at least three hospitals in Wuhan, who were diagnosed with viral pneumonia of unidentified cause. 14 All five CDC samples were negative for all common respiratory pathogens screened for. Special-pathogen-free human airway epithelial (HAE) cells were used for virus isolation. HAE cells were maintained in an air-liquid interface incubated at 37°C. After three passages, apical samples were collected for sequencing. The first cases were reported in December, 2019. 2019-nCoV is most closely related to other betacoronaviruses of bat origin, indicating that these animals are the likely reservoir hosts for this emerging viral pathogen. Currently available data suggest that 2019-nCoV infected the human population from a bat reservoir, although it remains unclear if a currently unknown animal species acted as an intermediate host between bats and humans. The following program was run on the thermocycler: 95°C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min as determined by product size; 72°C for 7 min; and a 4°C hold. First, viral RNAs were extracted directly from clinical samples with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and then used to synthesise cDNA with the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and N6 random primers, followed by second-strand synthesis with DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment (ThermoFisher). PCR products were sequenced with use of M13 forward and reverse primers. Potential genetic recombination was investigated using SimPlot software (version 3.5.1) 20 and phylogenetic analysis. Fluorescence was recorded during the 58°C phase. The funder of the study had no role in data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of report. After removing host (human) reads, de novo assembly was done and the contigs obtained used as queries to search the non-redundant protein database. These consensus sequences were then used as new reference genomes. Eight complete genomes and two partial genomes (from samples WH19002 and WH02; table) were obtained. The de novo assembly of the clean reads from all the pools did not identify any other long contigs that corresponded to other viruses at high abundance. The largest nucleotide difference was four mutations. In addition, the partial genomes from samples WH02 and WH19002 also had nearly 100% identity to the complete genomes across the aligned gene regions. The notable exception was the spike protein, with only around 80% sequence identity, and protein 13, with 73·2% sequence identity. 25, 26 Generally, the spike protein of coronaviruses is functionally divided into the S1 domain (especially positions 318-510 of SARS-CoV), responsible for receptor binding, and the S2 domain, responsible for cell membrane fusion. Both the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of the S1 domain can bind to host receptors. Through phylogenetic analysis of the receptor-binding domain of four different lineages of betacoronaviruses (appendix p 4), we found that, although 2019-nCoV was closer to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 at the whole-genome level, the receptor-binding domain of 2019-nCoV fell within lineage B and was closer to that of SARS-CoV (figure 5A). Epidemiologically, eight of the nine patients in our study had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, suggesting that they might have been in close contact with the infection source at the market. However, one patient had never visited the market, although he had stayed in a hotel near the market before the onset of their illness. This finding suggests either possible droplet transmission or that the patient was infected by a currently unknown source. It is, therefore, striking that the sequences of 2019-nCoV from different patients described here were almost identical, with greater than 99·9% sequence identity. However, as the virus transmits to more individuals, constant surveillance of mutations arising is needed. 23 These data are consistent with a bat reservoir for coronaviruses in general and for 2019-nCoV in particular. Therefore, on the basis of current data, it seems likely that the 2019-nCoV causing the Wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats, and might have been transmitted to humans via currently unknown wild animal(s) sold at the Huanan seafood market. Recombination has been seen frequently in coronaviruses. Data are available on various websites and have been made publicly available (more information can be found in the first paragraph of the Results section)."

 This review provides an overview of recent developments in ""chemical virology."" Viruses, as materials, provide unique nanoscale scaffolds that have relevance in chemical biology and nanotechnology, with diverse areas of applications. Some fundamental advantages of viruses, compared to synthetically programmed materials, include the highly precise spatial arrangement of their subunits into a diverse array of shapes and sizes and many available avenues for easy and reproducible modification. Here, we will first survey the broad distribution of viruses and various methods for producing virus-based nanoparticles, as well as engineering principles used to impart new functionalities. We will then examine the broad range of applications and implications of virus-based materials, focusing on the medical, biotechnology, and energy sectors. We anticipate that this field will continue to evolve and grow, with exciting new possibilities stemming from advancements in the rational design of virus-based nanomaterials. and nanoscience. To date, it has not been feasible to synthetically create nanoparticles of comparable reproducibility, beauty, and utility. In a collaborative effort, research into ""physical or chemical virology"" is directed toward unraveling the processes of self-assembly and genome packaging, understanding and controlling self-assembly of virus-based materials into higher-order hierarchical structures, engineering and studying virus-based and virus-like materials for applications in the health and energy sectors, and scaled-up manufacturing of such materials for applications in clinics and in devices. In this review, we provide a general synopsis of the engineering of virus-based and virus-like materials and we will discuss the manifold and diverse applications of such. We start by introducing the use of viruses from a materials perspective and consider the methods for producing and modifying these particles. We then survey some recent developments in the expansion of their applications, with discussion focused on the utilization of virus-based materials for medicine (delivery systems and contrast agents), biotechnology (nanoreactors and sensing devices), and energy (battery electrodes and storage devices). Finally, we assess the opportunities and challenges for clinical or commercial application of virus-inspired materials.","Nanoscale engineering is revolutionizing diverse disciplines in science and engineering. The use of viral scaffolds in particular has led to advancements of scientific knowledge in selfassembly and the development of novel materials with wide-ranging applications. Viruses have been studied for more than 100 years, and more than 5,000 types of viruses have been discovered and described. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and from a chemist's point of view they harbor many natural features that are uniquely relevant to nanotechnology crystal structures. [11] [12] [13] [14] In this manner, viruses can simply be used as well-ordered materials, separate from their normal role in infection. Most viruses are made up of coat protein subunits that naturally self-assemble into truly monodisperse particles. With more understanding of the coat protein building blocks and chemical biology, ever increasing complex assemblies can be programmed, including nanoboomerang-and tetrapod-shaped virus materials. 15 Large-scale production of viruses can be easily achieved through propagation in their natural hosts or expression in a heterologous system (see Section 2.2). Additionally, these particles come in a variety of shapes and sizes 16, 17 that can function as nanoscaffolds that can be easily and reproducibly modified 18 . As shown in Figure 1 , the most common architectures are icosahedrons, filaments, and phage head-and-tail structures, but more diverse structures such as spindle-, zipper-, and bottle-shaped viruses also exist. 17, 19 While there is the biotechnology arm where we seek to engineer particles for applications in medicine and energy, there is also a basic arm that investigates virus assembly and structure. These two arms of research are interconnected, with crosstalk between the two fields providing insights for advancement. For example, study of the physics of the packing signals of RNA viruses led to its application in the encapsulation of therapeutics for nanomedical applications (see Sections 4.1.4-4.1.5). 14, 20 Additionally, fundamental understanding of the interactions involved in particle self-assembly informed the fabrication of novel imaging agents (see Section 4.1.2). 21, 22 Through multidisciplinary collaboration, the use of viral scaffolds as unique materials for diverse applications can be realized.
 To differentiate between viruses containing their native nucleic acid, which are referred to as viral nanoparticles (VNPs), viruses devoid of their nucleic acid are considered virus-like particles (VLPs). Further classification of viruses can be based on a number of features, including the shape and structure of their capsids (as shown in Figure 1 ), the type of nucleic acid they contain (double-stranded (ds) or single-stranded (ss), RNA or DNA), and their host species. Classical virology taxonomy utilizes the Baltimore classification of viruses, in which the viruses are grouped both according to their genomes as well as their method of replication. 23 Figure 2 illustrates the seven different classifications of viruses, demonstrating how they have evolved many different strategies for replication. However, for the most part, we will be considering plant viruses and bacteriophages (noninfectious particles) for use as materials, making the native cargo of the capsids less relevant. Mammalian viruses, such as adenovirus (class I -dsDNA virus) and adeno-associated virus (AAV, class II -ssDNA virus), do offer many advantages for applications in gene therapy, in which they can be administered to make modifications to the genetic sequence for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes (see Section 4.1.4). 24 They also present opportunities in cancer immunotherapy, as seen in the recent approval of T-VEC for treatment of melanoma (see Section 4.1.3). Nevertheless, bacteriophage-and plant virus-derived materials may offer advantages, as their manufacture is scalable through fermentation and molecular farming. Additionally, these materials are not infectious toward mammals, adding another layer of safety. Both these factors are important considerations as we move toward clinical applications and commercialization.
 Other than genomic content and host species, shape and size are important characteristics that should be considered for the choice of material used. Section 4.1.1 highlights some of the design guidelines for determining the desired properties for delivery vectors for nanomedical applications. For icosahedral viruses, the triangulation number, or T number, is one method of classification that gives an indication as to their size (see Figure 1 ). The T number was first described by Donald Caspar and Aaron Klug in 1962. 25 By multiplying by 60, it can be used to determine the number of coat proteins in a capsid. For example, a T = 1 virus has 60 coat proteins, while a T = 4 virus has 240 coat proteins. The proteins are clustered into pentamers and hexamers, and a virus with icosahedral symmetry therefore consists of 12 pentamers and 10(T-1) hexamers. Size plays a factor in the transport and clearance behavior of a particle, as well as the amount of cargo that can be carried and delivered to a cell, a challenge with the smaller AAV (T = 1, ~20 nm in diameter). Additionally, the shape of the particles affects the possible modifications and functions that could be applied to the capsid. For example, icosahedrons have the advantage of possessing an interior cavity that can be used for the infusion and encapsulation of various payloads. On the other hand, high aspect ratio particles can be used to form wires, which can then be applied for energy applications. Overall, it is clear that there is a diverse library of virus particles to select from, no matter the application.
 A variety of methods have been developed for the production of virus particles, and we will discuss their manufacture in bacteria, yeast, insect cells, plants, and using cell-free systems, starting with one of the most widely utilized systems for the rapid production of proteins with ease of scale-up, Escherichia coli. 26 Although other prokaryotic systems can also be considered, such as Pseudomonas fluorescens, 27 the wealth of knowledge surrounding E. coli production makes it popular, and therefore it has also been widely applied for the production of VLPs. Viral coat proteins can be expressed and spontaneously self-assembled in the bacterial cells, and this has been demonstrated for bacteriophages, such as Qβ 28 and MS2, 29 as well as for heterologous expression of other viruses, such as plant virus-based TMV 30 and mammalian virus-based hepatitis B virus (HBV) core particles. 31 It should be noted that while VLPs formed in this way do not contain their own genomic content, they are also not ""empty"", as they tend to package host nucleic acids. For example, about 25% of the mass of Qβ VLPs (a system that has undergone clinical testing) consists of E. coli RNA. 32 For applications where the packaged nucleic acid is undersirable, several methods have been developed to remove the nucleic acid components after particle assembly. [33] [34] [35] These methods include treatment with heavy metals such as lead acetate, 33 incubation in alkaline conditions for RNA hydrolysis, 34 and induction of osmotic shock using a high molarity sodium sulfate solution. 35 Another approach for production of empty VLPs is in vitro assembly of coat protein subunits after production in E. coli and purification. In vitro assembly is also a way to overcome challenges with insolubility of some eukaryotic capsid proteins in the bacteria cells that result in their accumulation in inclusion bodies. 36 Digressing briefly, it is of significance to note that some headway has been made with producing soluble eukaryotic cDNA of the virus genome, or even in vitro RNA transcripts to the leaves of the plant after gentle abrasion. 54, 55 Agroinfiltration by injecting a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens bacteria into leaves is also used for molecular farming in plants. 56 These bacteria transfer part of their tumor inducing plasmid into the plant cell, which can be exploited for transient expression of genes of interest. Of note, Medicago Inc. uses this plant-based approach for the efficient production of VLP-based vaccines for influenza and rabies, among others. Other therapeutics such as the ZMAPP monoclonal antibody cocktail against Ebola virus (EBOV) from Mapp Biopharmaceutical also utilize plant production with agroinfiltration. 57 Replication of intact VNPs such as BMV has been demonstrated. 58 Additionally, viral capsids of CPMV completely devoid of RNA (either virus or host) can be produced in this way. 59 Whereas BMV production utilized plasmids that transiently express BMV RNAs to systemically infect plants, for empty CPMV (eCPMV) VLP production, using plasmids encoding just two proteins was found to be sufficient: VP60, which is a precursor to CPMV's two coat proteins, and 24K proteinase for proteolytic processing of VP60. As mentioned previously, consistent empty VLP production in vivo has only been demonstrated for the eCPMV platform. Aside from farming in the plants themselves, some new technology that may be applied in the future for the production of VLPs is the use of plant cell packs for transient expression, where plant suspension cells are packed into a ""cookie"" through suctioning, then Agrobacterium containing the gene for the protein of interest applied. 60 This approach has been proven to produce high yields of recombinant proteins and can be applied in a high throughput manner, making it an attractive option for VLP expression.
 Finally, as an alternative to the above in vivo approaches, there has been some work involving VLP production using cell-free systems where cellular machinery for transcription and translation are used for protein expression in vitro. Some early work in this area utilized a eukaryotic system based on rabbit reticulocyte to study capsid assembly of hepatitis C virus (HCV), HBV, and three primate lentiviruses, but the yields were quite low (~10 ng/ μL). 61, 62 Since then, exploration with an E. coli-based system has achieved yields of around 400 ng/μL for MS2 and truncated HBV core antigen VLP production, with almost complete solubility, making it an excellent platform for rapid VLP production. 63 Additionally, Qβ VLPs were able to be formed using this system through coproduction of its coat protein with a cytotoxic A2 protein that is normally naturally incorporated on the exterior of the capsid to facilitate infection, demonstrating the advantage of a cell-free system for cytotoxic protein production and regulating the relative expression of multiple proteins. 64 As the cost of cellfree systems goes down, they may become more commonly applied for the production of VLPs.
 Since viruses have evolved to protect and efficiently deliver their nucleic acid cargo, they are able to withstand conditions required for chemical modification and retain a long shelf life. For modification, the interior cavity and exterior surface of the viral capsids can both be utilized, allowing for the encapsulation of sensitive compounds and the display of targeting moieties in precisely defined arrays, among other functions. The beauty and utility of these particles have been recognized, and efforts have been made toward mimicking these nanoscale architectures through self-assembly of protein nanomaterials. 65 The unique genetically encoded protein shell architecture of virus-based scaffolds allows for a large range of techniques that can be used to tailor and modify these materials. Among the most frequently used of these that we will discuss are genetic engineering, bioconjugation, infusion, biomineralization, and self-assembly ( Figure 3) . As engineering capabilities improve, even greater diversities of virus-based and virus-like particles can be created, expanding the possible applications of these materials.
 The coat proteins of VNPs are determined by their genetic code. Nucleic acid sequences of viruses are relatively small, and therefore many of their genomes have been sequenced and are well characterized. Using genetic engineering, insertion or replacement of residues can be performed to add functional groups, with cysteine mutants being the most popular due to possible disulfide linkages, association with gold, and bioconjugation with thiol-selective chemistries. [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] Insertion of unnatural amino acids is also possible, allowing for more diverse chemical modifications. 71, 72 Additionally, removal of residues can be accomplished such that only a single unique reactive site remains on the coat protein. 73 Aside from single residue modifications, larger changes such as insertion of purification tags can also be accomplished. For example, due to their affinity and coordination with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA), polyhistidine tags have been expressed on viral capsids to serve as anchors for applications that include tethering them to surfaces, attaching other particles such as nanogold and iron oxide, and assembling higher-order structures. [74] [75] [76] [77] Display of other short peptide sequences have been demonstrated, including epitopes for vaccines [78] [79] [80] and moieties for targeting receptors. [81] [82] [83] Whole protein and protein domain insertions can also be achieved, 84, 85 and even virus hybrids consisting of coat proteins expressing different proteins have been established through co-infection of plants, with verification by bimolecular fluorescence complementation. 86 Aside from genetic engineering of the viral coat proteins, tags such as the antibody binding peptide Z33 can be genetically fused to fluorescent proteins, enzymes, and other proteins of interest. 87 In this particular example, assembly of particles displaying the proteins can then be achieved by means of an intermediary antibody specific to the viral coat protein.
 Conjugation strategies targeting both natural and unnatural amino acids on virus capsids allow for many possible modifications that may not be achievable through genetic engineering alone (Figure 4) . Both the interior and exterior surfaces of many viruses have been shown to be amenable to chemical modifications. [88] [89] [90] Some common groups that can be functionalized include lysine, aspartic/glutamic acid, cysteine, and tyrosine residues, which lend themselves to standard bioconjugation reactions involving Nhydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester conjugation, carbodiimide activation, Michael addition, and azo coupling chemistries. Some alternatives to these natural amino acids include replacing methionine residues with homopropargyl glycine (HPG) or azidohomoalanine (AHA) residues to add alkyne or azide functionalities, respectively. 71 Another interesting method utilizes mutant tRNA synthetases to attach unnatural amino acids to amber suppressor tRNAs for incorporation of these amino acids at amber stop codon sites. 72, 91 Among the amino acids incorporated in this way are O-methyltyrosine, pazidophenylalanine, p-acetylphenylalanine, p-benzoylphenylalanine, 3-(2-naphthyl)alanine, and p-aminophenylalanine (pAF). p-azidophenylalanine and pAF are particularly noteworthy due to providing azide and amine groups, respectively, for selective coupling reactions. As can be noted, incorporation of azide and alkyne groups is an especially widespread strategy. These conjugation handles allow for copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), an efficient and biocompatible procedure that has found great versatility. [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] Reaction without copper catalysis can also be achieved by utilizing cyclooctyne derivatives, which lower the activation barrier due to the ring strain. 97 Additional reaction handles that have been utilized include aldehydes and ketones for hydrazone or oxime condensation reactions. 88, [98] [99] [100] Selective formation of aldehydes or ketones is possible, where pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-mediated transamination specific for the N-terminus leads to in situ oxidation of the N-terminal amine. 101 The formed ketone or an aldehyde group can then be used to form stable oxime linkages with alkoxyamines. With the availability of a wide range of chemically modifiable natural and unnatural amino acids, multiple functional groups can be simultaneously incorporated within a single virusbased particle to result in the formation of a versatile, multifunctional platform.
 One area of particle modification that is of great interest is the formation of protein/polymer hybrid conjugates. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a polymer frequently used for shielding biological interactions, and attachment of PEG through aforementioned bioconjugation techniques is fairly standard. 89, 102, 103 More sophisticated polymerization chemistry techniques have also been shown to be applicable for polymer attachment to virus-based particles, and more widespread application of these could confer advantages of better efficiency and more control over the polydispersity. Atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is one such method, where small initiators can be added to the particles first then polymerization from the capsid carried out through the introduction of monomers, resulting in easier purification of the smaller reagents as well as overcoming challenges with steric hindrance of large bulky polymers. 33, 104, 105 Incorporation of polymers using this method has proven to useful for the attachment or complexation of large payloads of MR contrast agents, chemotherapeutics, and siRNA and for both interior 33, 104 and exterior 105 modification. Polymers could also be synthesized first with ATRP before attachment to the viral capsid, such as for the display of glycoproteins. 106 (ROMP) is another method for biocompatible polymer synthesis, and it was utilized to prepare water-soluble polynorbornene-based polymers with strict size and architecture control, which had a good safety profile when attached to Qβ and delivered to fibroblast cells. 107 Aside from chemistries that rely on covalent bonds, supramolecular chemistry strategies can also be utilized for virus modification. For example, by taking advantage of the hydrophobic interior of β-cyclodextrin that allows it to accommodate a range of guest molecules, virus particles first modified with β-cyclodextrin moieties can then be functionalized with derivatives of such guest molecules. This approach has been demonstrated using derivatives of adamantine for the display of an imaging agent, chemotherapeutic drug, targeting ligand, and PEG polymer. 108 In a similar manner, charge-transfer interactions between electron donors and acceptors can also be used for derivatization of viral scaffolds. As an illustration, attachment of pyrene molecules allowed for particle functionalization through interaction with electron-deficient dinitrophenyl and pyridinium motifs. 109 
 The interior of viral capsids can be used as a cage for encapsulation of foreign cargo. Viruses are generally flexible and contain pores that allow for diffusion of small molecules, such as drugs and contrast agents, into and out of the capsid. Retention of the molecules inside the capsid can then be achieved through electrostatic and/or affinity interactions with the nucleic acid within the shell 93, 110, 111 or interactions with polymers conjugated internally. 33, 104 Encapsulation of molecules can also be accomplished by gating using pH or metal ion concentration to trigger structural transitions. Using the gating process, molecules are allowed to diffuse into the particle under an environment where the capsid is in a swollen, open conformation, and then the molecules are trapped within the capsid as the pores are closed off through change in buffer conditions. [112] [113] [114] Depending on the desired application, the molecules of interest can either remain encapsulated within the particles or released over time. Examples of infusion for imaging and drug delivery are described in Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.5. Another application of infusion is for introducing metal precursors into the capsid for interior mineralization, which is discussed next.
 Viral particles can also serve as templates in the biomineralization process with unique size and shape control. Through tuning electrostatics or the use of mineralization-directing peptides, nucleation of precursor metal ions and subsequent shape-constrained mineralization can be realized. Peptide nucleators and binders were identified by screening using phage display techniques against various substrates, such as GaAs and ZnS, 115, 116 and shown to be highly specific. Mineralization has been demonstrated for the interior 11, 117-119 and the exterior 120-122 surfaces of particles, as well as for both icosahedral 11, 117, 118, 122 and rod-shaped [119] [120] [121] viruses. These resulting hybrid inorganicorganic materials find use in a variety of functions, ranging from applications in energy as semiconductors (see Section 4.3) to medicine as contrast agents (see Section 4.1).
 While we have mostly considered these virus-based particles as intact scaffolds we can build from, they can also be taken apart and reassembled, either with their natural genome or with foreign cargo. There is a great breadth in the types of cargo that can be encapsulated through self-assembly, including gold nanoparticles, quantum dots, and photosensitizer drugs. 21, [123] [124] [125] [126] Since coat proteins naturally self-assemble around negatively charged nucleic acids, in general a more negative surface charge results in more efficient encapsulation of the foreign cargo. 123 Native packaging mechanisms can also be utilized, which was demonstrated with adding oligonucleotides mimicking the origin of assembly for RCNMV's packaging of its RNA on various nanoparticles to induce particle formation around the different cargo. 127 Size plays a factor in assembly due to its effect on the radius of curvature, and differently sized cargo could result in alterations in the morphology and physical characteristics of the capsid. [123] [124] [125] As seen in Section 3.1, coat proteins can be genetically modified for incorporation of foreign protein cargo during particle assembly. One study fused the coat proteins of CCMV to elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), which exhibit lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior, and the investigators found two different self-assembly pathways from the resultant hybrid. 128 While VLPs consisting of 90 coat protein dimers were formed under normal pH-induced self-assembly conditions, when the NaCl concentration was increased to lower the ELP transition temperature, the ELP-induced assembly resulted in the formation of smaller particles consisting of 30 coat protein dimers. Enzyme facilitation is another method for coat protein modification, which was demonstrated through the use of sortase A to covalently attach a protein with a C-terminal LPETG tag to glycines at the N-terminus of CCMV coat proteins before assembly for protein encapsulation. 129 Specific binding interactions with the coat protein can also be exploited for self-assembly. Engineering of coiled-coil protein interactions was established by introducing a lysine coil at the Nterminus of CCMV that can associate with a glutamic acid coil at the C-terminus of a fluorescent protein, which resulted in encapsulation of the protein when the two modified proteins were combined. 130 Introducing histidine tags that have affinity for Ni-NTA is another method. 77 Additionally, some interactions that naturally exist for some particles include the association of scaffold proteins with bacteriophage P22 that aids in viral assembly 131, 132 and the binding of translational repression operator proteins to RNA stemloops within MS2 bacteriophages. 14 Fusions to these proteins can then be utilized for encapsulation of materials of interest, such as enzyme cascades and therapeutic molecules.
 Viruses have been applied broadly in medicine for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, and many are in the pipeline undergoing clinical trials for oncotherapy and as gene therapy vectors. 133, 134 In fact, there is currently much excitement over the recent approval of the oncotherapy talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) manufactured by Amgen, 135 and T-VEC will be discussed in more detail in Section 4.1.3. Bacteriophages and plant viruses are particularly attractive tools for biomedical applications because they do not replicate within mammalian cells, and therefore the platforms may add another layer of safety. In this section, we will explore the use of virus-based particles as delivery vehicles targeted toward imaging and treatment of diseases and as scaffolds that interact with the local environment, which can be utilized for vaccines, immunotherapy, and tissue engineering.
 for the design of viruses for applications in vivo include charge, shape, and surface ligand presentation ( Figure 5) . These design parameters affect their circulation in the body as well as their cellular interactions and tissue specificity. Some general principles have been established specifically for virus-based particles, 136 and we will highlight some of the lessons here. It is important to note that although these principles provide a good guideline, in vivo studies are crucial for ascertaining how new proposed particles will behave due to the intricacy and complexity of biological interactions, which cannot be fully predicted through in vitro testing or modeling.
 In terms of charge, there appears to be a trend where virus-based particles with negative surface charge tend to have shorter circulation times. This was observed with negatively charged CCMV, CPMV, and TMV, which have circulation half-lives of less than 10 minutes. [137] [138] [139] In comparison, the half-lives for positively charged Qβ and M13 are on the order of 4-5 hours. 140, 141 The effect of charge on plasma clearance was made more evident when much quicker clearance for both bacteriophages was observed with the neutralization of their positive lysine residues. 140, 141 Additionally, the reverse study with a single amino acid substitution of glutamic acid residues with lysines using bacteriophage λ resulted in over a 1000-fold higher circulation time. 142 A notable exception to this trend is PVX, which is expected to be longer circulating based on its positive charge and abundance of surface lysines but in fact has a quick clearance half-life of around 10 minutes. 143 A more recent study reported a negative zeta potential for PVX, 144 likely due to different buffer conditions used, which indicates further investigation into the charge of PVX under in vivo conditions is crucial for confirming whether or not it defies convention.
 Additional influences based on charge include altering how particles interact with mammalian cells and tumor transport rates. Due to the abundant presence of proteoglycan in the cell membrane conferring a negative charge and collagen within the tumor interstitial space conferring a positive charge, positively charged particles are more likely to have enhanced binding to mammalian cells 145 and are better able to avoid aggregation and penetrate tumor tissue. 143, 146 Some examples demonstrating these charge-based effects include polyarginine-decorated CPMV found to be taken up eight times more efficiently than native CPMV in a human cervical cancer cell line 145 and positively charged PVX shown to be able to penetrate to the tumor core unlike negatively charged CPMV. 143 In the latter case, PVX's filamentous nature also allowed it to better avoid the macrophagocytic system, leading to greater tumor homing.
 It is likely that the shape and flexibility of PVX plays an additional role in its ability to diffuse throughout the tumor. A comparison between the diffusion profiles of a spherical and rod-shaped particle was performed with CPMV and TMV using a spheroid model, and it was shown that whereas CPMV experienced a steady diffusion profile, TMV exhibited a two-phase diffusion behavior that entailed an extremely rapid early loading phase, which could be attributed to its movement axially, acting like a needle. 147 Some other advantageous properties that are conferred by elongated particles include better margination toward the vessel wall and stronger adherence due to greater surface area for interaction, which not only have implications for tumor homing but also for enhanced targeting of cardiovascular disease. 148, 149 Shape is a difficult parameter to account for due to the challenge of producing monodisperse particles that can be precisely and reproducibly tailored at the nanoscale, but this challenge can be surmounted using VNPs and VLPs due to the specificity of their self-assembly process. Some bottom-up assembly approaches have been investigated recently to elucidate the role of aspect ratio in cell uptake, biodistribution, and tumor homing. In one approach, CPMV particles were linked together to form chains in order to maintain charge and surface properties while modifying the aspect ratio, and dimers with an aspect ratio of 2 were found to target cancer cells more efficiently than single particles. 150 Higher aspect ratios were investigated in another study that utilized in vitro assembly of TMV around synthetic RNA to form rods of various lengths (300, 130 , and 60 nm, corresponding to aspect ratios of 16.5, 7, and 3.5) . 151 For receptor-targeted particles modified with the RGD ligand, rods with an intermediate aspect ratio of 7 were found to be more efficient at tumor targeting due to a combination of better macrophage avoidance and greater adhesion to target integrins compared to the short rods and better diffusion within the tumor compared to the long rods. Based on the aforementioned spheroid study with TMV, 147 it is likely that the three aspect ratios experience similar axial diffusion during the initial rapid phase, but then longer particles are impeded during the slower distribution phase. In contrast, PVX particles with an aspect ratio of 40 appear not be hindered by their length and in fact experience better penetration in relation to icosahedral CPMV. 143 Some possible reasons to account for this include a thinner cross-section and greater flexibility for PVX compared to TMV. To further expand understanding of the role of shape, other factors such as density and flexibility should be considered in future studies.
 Surface presentation of shielding polymers also plays a role in the in vivo behavior of virusbased particles. PEG is the standard polymer used to reduce immunogenicity and nonspecific cell interactions. The importance of polymer coatings is particularly apparent in the study highlighted above with different aspect ratios of TMV. Although it was found that targeted particles fared better when intermediate in size, coating the TMV with PEG allowed the shorter rods to be better able to avoid clearance and, paired with their superior diffusion properties within the tumor, resulted in increased passive tumor targeting of the short 60 nm PEGylated rods. 151 Surface PEGylation has been applied to many VNPs and has been established as a broadly applicable method for extending circulation time. 102, 138, 152, 153 Additionally, differences in the route of clearance was also observed, with non-PEGylated TMV and PVX filaments getting filtered through the kidneys, while PEGylated particles do not, likely due to the increase in the width of the particles after conjugation preventing renal filtration. 102, 138, 154 The conformation of the PEG coating can be predicted computationally through estimating its surface coverage on the particle and its hydrodynamic radius to determine the packing density of the polymer. The use of higher molecular weight PEG generally results in a higher hydrodynamic radius and thus better shielding, but hydrodynamic radius is only an average and polymers can extend and collapse in solution. Despite a smaller predicted radius, branched PEG with multiple sites of attachment to the particle has been shown to be more effective at shielding than linear PEG four times its molecular weight, likely because simultaneous tethering of the ends of the PEG traps it closer to the particle, reducing its movement and the possibility of nonspecific protein adsorption. We hypothesize that the branched PEG leads to a more efficient shield, preventing the formation of a protein corona that may tag the virus-based nanoparticles for recognition by the innate immune system and lead to removal from circulation ( Figure 6 ). 102 Therefore, the dynamics of PEG in solution should also be considered when determining its conformation for optimization of particle shielding.
 Other polymer coatings are also being studied, with poly(N-(2hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) (pHPMA) being another hydrophilic polymer used, particularly with AAV and adenovirus in order to eliminate normal infection pathways and allow redirection of the viruses through other pathways. 155, 156 Some cationic polymers, such as poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers 157 and polyethyleneimine, 158 have also been explored for shielding from infection as well as for improving transfection efficiency. For more control and diversity of polymerization, chemistries have been established for grafting polymers to and from viral scaffolds using ATRP and ROMP, as discussed in Section 3.2, but their properties in vivo have not yet been established. The use of serum albumin has been recently investigated for coating of TMV and shown to be more effective than medium-length PEG (5000 Da), with circulation times up to 10-fold greater in comparison. 159 Self peptides based on human CD47 could also be considered for inhibiting phagocytic clearance of the nanoparticles. 160 Along with surface modifications that allow them to avoid undesirable cell interactions, particles can be enhanced for specific cell targeting through the display of receptor-specific or disease environment-specific ligands. Some examples of targets that have been used for specific uptake of virus-based nanoparticles include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 161, 162 and folate receptor (FR). 163, 164 In such a manner, overexpressed receptors or environmental cues can be tracked for diagnostic or drug delivery purposes, which will be discussed in the following sections. To obtain the most favorable ligand display density, there is a balance between increasing avidity and reducing cellular receptor depletion that arises from increased ligand density. 165 While multivalency and a higher degree of labeling with targeting ligands is beneficial for stronger cellular interactions, too many ligands may reduce the extent of endocytosis through exhaustion of cellular receptors. Another design parameter for the inclusion of targeting ligands is the linker used for attachment. For example, the inclusion of PEG can assist in increasing circulation time and avoiding nonspecificity as discussed above. Additionally, PEG linkers can improve cell targeting by adding flexibility and enhancing presentation of targeting peptides. 166 By altering the characteristics of the linker, the interaction of the ligand with its target and the overall behavior of the particle in vivo can be tuned.
 have been used for tissue-specific imaging and delivery of contrast agents in applications of optical imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). The utility of using viruses as imaging probes comes from the d iversity of approaches for modification of the particles as well as the ease of precise assembly. In addition, clearance and removal from the body are critical for preventing toxicity from tissue retention of contrast agents, and many VNP platforms tend to be cleared quickly from the body (half-life of minutes) [137] [138] [139] 154 compared to some synthetic materials that require months for clearance, such as carbon nanotubes, gold, and silica. [167] [168] [169] Imaging is an important tool in medicine for diagnostics and for visualization of disease localization and progression, as well as treatment success. With improvements in imaging technology, earlier disease detection and better prognosis can be realized. The ability to track particles further aids in the evaluation of drug delivery platforms, as it can be used for confirmation of cell-specific uptake and investigation of interactions of particles within the body, such as their clearance, biodistribution, and immunogenicity.
 Fluorescence imaging is the main modality for preclinical evaluation and was used to aid in the establishment of the design rules in Section 4.1.1. Fluorescent agents can be incorporated into viral capsids through bioconjugation, 170, 171 genetic engineering, 84, 86 infusion, 110, 114 and self-assembly. 21, 130 Fluorescence is useful for quantification of particle uptake using flow cytometry, visualization of particle localization through confocal microscopy, and determination of biodistribution using in vivo imaging. Although high dye densities can easily be achieved through efficient capsid modification strategies, sensitivity decreases after a certain threshold due to fluorophores experiencing quenching when placed at distances less than approximately 10 nm. Therefore, a fairly low density of around 10% is more ideal for achieving optimal fluorescence intensity. 172 Encapsulation of indocyanine green can be utilized as a method for near infrared (NIR) photoacoustic imaging, and it has shown greater photostability compared to the chromophore alone. 173 As advancements are made, another aspect that could be explored is the integration of gold nanoparticles with fluorophores for metal-enhanced fluorescence with improved quantum yields and decreased photobleaching. 174 First iteration native and PEGylated particles can be directly evaluated for their biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and tumor homing behavior through fluorescence imaging. 84, 90, 102, 138, 143, 175 Overall, particles are cleared mainly through the liver and spleen, with filamentous particles having a higher rate of spleen clearance compared to icosahedra l particles, 138, 143 localizing with B cells within the white pulp over time. 102, 138 Due to leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage, the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is found in solid tumors and can be utilized for tumor imaging through nanoparticle deposition. Using both mouse and chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) models with tumor xenografts, the passive partitioning of particles to the tumor can be observed (Figure 7) . 84, 143 As discussed in the previous section, evaluation of localization of particles inside the tumor revealed enhanced accumulation and penetration of rod-shaped particles. 143 Besides passive tumor homing properties, natural interactions of viruses with certain cells can also be exploited. CPMV in particular exhibits unique specificity in interacting with surface vimentin, which is found on endothelial, cancer, and inflammatory cells. [176] [177] [178] [179] The native affinity of CPMV for surface vimentin allows for high-resolution imaging of microvasculature up to 500 μm in depth, which cannot be achieved through the use of other nanoparticles, as they tend to aggregate and block the vasculature. 180 This interaction can be utilized for a range of applications, such as delivery to a panel of cancer cells including cervical, breast, and colon cancer cell lines, 110 delineation of atherosclerotic lesions, 177 and intravital imaging of tumor vasculature and angiogenesis. 180 Another example of an existing endogenous association is CPV with transferrin receptor (TfR), an important receptor for iron transport into cells and highly upregulated by numerous cancer cell lines. 52 Even after dye labeling, CPV retains its specificity for TfR and was shown to bind to receptors found on HeLa cervical cancer cells, HT-29 colon cancer cells, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. As a quick side note, in vivo imaging of bacterial infections and differentiation between F-positive and F-negative E. coli strains is also possible through specificity of binding of M13 phage. 181 Specificity can also be introduced through the incorporation of targeting ligands for molecular imaging. RGD is a targeting peptide that is frequently used due to its high affinity for α v β 3 and α v β 5 integrins, which are involved in angiogenesis and associated with cancer proliferation. 81, 151, 182, 183 The association of RGD-targeted particles with tumor vascular endothelium has been demonstrated in mice, although the study also indicated that better tumor localization would be achieved with greater circulation time imparted through incorporation of a better shielding linker (see Section 4.1.1). 151 CPMV displaying peptide F56, which was discovered through phage display, has been used to target vascular endothelial growth fa ctor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), with accumulation throughout the tumor observed compared to no detectable uptake of non-targeted particles. 99 Other options that have been explored include FR targeting with folic acid (FA), 164, 184, 185 TfR with transferrin, 186 and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) with a PSMA antibody. 187 In recent years, a target that has been approached from many angles is epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), an important biomarker overexpressed on many malignant cell types. Strategies range from display of EGF on Qβ through genetic engineering, 162 using phage antibody libraries to select for fd phages with single-chain antibody variable fragments (scFvs) specific for EGFR as well as its related receptor human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), 101 conjugation of EGFR antibodies on MS2, 188 and also chemical attachment of GE11 peptide on PVX. 161 These studies all evaluated cell binding in vitro and there are some promising results indicating partitioning of targeted particles to tumor cells compared to macrophages in co-cultures, 161 and it would be of interest to see their development in mouse models.
 Outside of membrane proteins of cancer cells, proteins highly expressed by activated endothelial cells, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, can be utilized for targeted imaging of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerotic plaques. 148 Beyond such strategies, matrix and secreted proteins are also advantageous targets. For example, collagen 189 and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), 190, 191 an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, can be detected for tumor imaging through target-specific peptides displayed on M13. SPARC in particular has been successfully targeted for deep tissue imaging of lung cancer, 191 and it has even been used for guided resection of ovarian cancer through the pairing of M13 with fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), 190 which allows for non-photobleached fluorescence with less background in the second NIR window ranging from 950-1400 nm. The polymerized fibrin found in thrombi has also been investigated for the delineation of blood clots using MS2, CPMV, and TMV equipped with GPRPP 149, 192 and CREKA 149 pentapeptide amino acid sequences.
 The above studies investigating imaging of thrombosis 149 and atherosclerosis 148 established target-specific imaging not only with optical but also with MR imaging. MRI is a clinically relevant method for noninvasive disease characterization with good soft tissue contrast, and the use of contrast agents in conjunction with MR can improve the signal-to-noise ratio to highlight differences between diseased and normal tissues. Gadolinium is one such paramagnetic contrast agent that can be used to achieve brighter signal in T 1 -weighted imaging. Molecular imaging of atherosclerotic plaques was achieved at dosages 400 times lower than clinically used for angiography with the encapsulation Gd chelated with 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid, or Gd(DOTA), within TMV targeted to VCAM-1. 148 The high contrast can be attributed to the high payload of 1200 Gd/TMV, the slower molecular tumbling rate resulting from attachment of Gd(DOTA) to the macromolecule, inclusion of the targeting peptide, and the advantage imparted by the shape of TMV for drifting laterally to the vessel wall.
 This latest result is the culmination of numerous studies by several groups that formed stepping stones along the way. While early work looked at the direct binding of Gd to natural metal binding sites in the capsid of CCMV, 193 the use of chelation and bioconjugation was quickly introduced to mitigate concerns of free Gd leading to toxicity in patients with underlying kidney disease, with explorations using both DOTA 93, 194 and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). 195 These approaches resulted in per particle T 1 relaxivities on the order of 1,000 to 8,000 mM −1 s −1 measured at 64 MHz. While fairly high and much greater than 20 mM −1 s −1 for Gd alone, these values do not approach the measurement of around 28,000 mM −1 s −1 per particle from the initial study with direct attachment of Gd. 193 To improve contrast, interior and exterior labeling 196, 197 as well as rigidity of linkers 198 was explored with MS2 using chelators based on hydroxypyridinonate (HOPO) due to its 3-fold relaxivity enhancement compared to clinically used Magnevist, or Gd(DTPA). Internally modified capsids and more rigid linkers, in particular the S,S enantiomer of 1,2-cyclohexyldiamine, each demonstrated approximately 30 to 40% higher relaxivities. Enhancing Gd loading was another method explored to increase per particle relaxivity, either using ATRP to amplify density of groups with which to attach the contrast agents 104, 105 or using branched oligomers with multiple Gd(DTPA) complexes attached. 199, 200 The greatest success with this approach led to the incorporation of over 9,000 Gd(DTPA) per P22 particle, with per particle relaxivities exceeding 200,000 mM −1 s −1 . 104 In vivo imaging was first demonstrated using P22 conjugated to Gd(DTPA) in order to visualize blood vessels in a mouse, with clear depiction of the carotid artery, mammary arteries, the jugular vein, and veins in the head at a resolution of 250 μm. 200 More recently, relaxivities approaching 1,000,000 mM −1 s −1 per particle were reported by utilizing TMV's greater surface area conferred by its shape to introduce a large payload of Gd(DOTA), accompanied by thermal transition of the rods using conditions that result in 200 nm spheres. 201 Coating interiorly labeled TMV particles with silica could potentially increase the relaxivity 3-fold as well as lead to greater macrophage uptake and hence contrast. 202 It is expected that a combination of these research directions investigating chelators, linkers, conjugation, shape shifting, and coating will result in particles with even greater contrast for better visualization of disease.
 Apart from Gd-based contrast enhancement, manganese and iron oxide are other contrast agents that have been investigated. Manganese research is relatively new and labeling of P22 with Mn porphyrins was shown to have a per particle relaxivity of 7,000 mM −1 s −1 at 90 MHz, and while this is low compared to advancements in Gd imaging, it is a promising avenue to pursue due to the reduced toxicity of Mn. 203 Unlike Gd and Mn, iron oxide is a contrast agent for T 2 -weighted imaging and is observed from a resultant darker image. Interestingly, the first demonstration of MR imaging with iron oxide was in plants, where cubic iron oxide nanoparticles were encapsulated within BMV, Nicotiana benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with the modified virus, and imaging was performed with cell-to-cell trafficking of the encapsulated iron oxide observed. 204 Encapsulation of iron oxide nanoparticles and phantom imaging has been demonstrated with hepatitis B core VLPs. 77 Moving toward translation, attachment of iron oxide nanoparticles along with SPARC binding peptides to the surface of M13 was effective for the imaging of prostate cancer (Figure 8) . 205 Another MR contrast approach that is quite new is chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and hyperCEST imaging. Xenon-based agents in particular have been explored for viruses. After selective saturation of these nuclei, an enhanced water signal is observed due to saturation transfer to surrounding bulk water. This technique has found success with MS2, 206 M13, 207 and fd, 208 with sensitivities as low as 230 fM. 207 By additionally incorporating scFVs that recognize EGFR, molecular imaging and contrast specificity were demonstrated with MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, with essentially no contrast in Jurkat negative control cells. 208 Due to the more than 10,000-fold increase in sensitivity, there is a lot of potential in this new technology.
 PET imaging is another sensitive imaging modality and relies on the detection of radiotracers. It has been utilized for ascertaining the biodistribution of non-PEGylated 209 and PEGylated 210 MS2 capsids through incorporation of [ 18 F]fluorobenzaldehyde and 64 Cu chelated with DOTA, respectively. Taking it a step further, biodistribution of encapsulated or non-encapsulated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, 18 F, and poly-L-lysine (PLL) cation (for packaging 18 F) within hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelopes (HVJ-Es) was studied to determine whether magnetic stimulus can be used to redirect the viruses to the head, and it was clear that the application of the magnets altered the fate of the viruses, with increased signal in the head. 211 Targeting ligands were also explored in conjunction with PET imaging, with RGD for targeting human sarcoma 212 and glioma 213 xenografts and GE11 for targeting an EGFR positive liver cancer xenograft model. 157 In the context of virus-based particles, there has been less work with PET compared to the other imaging modalities. While PET has its advantages of high sensitivity and ability to image more deeply, radiotoxicity is an issue. For the purposes of simply detecting particle localization for diagnostics, MRI may be more ideal to pursue as technology improves.
 We will begin our foray into viral vectors for combatting diseases starting with vaccines, which has an extensive history and is likely the first medical application of viruses. Its popularization had an illustrious beginning in 1796 with Edward Jenner's experiment inoculating his gardener's eight-year-old son with cowpox, which resulted in protecting the boy from subsequent challenges with the more serious smallpox virus. 214 While knowledge of viruses would not come until 100 years later, with the work of Dmitry Ivanovsky and Martinus Beijerinck filtering TMV from plant sap and demonstrating its infectivity and replication, 7 the medical application of viruses had its roots here.
 Instead of live viruses, safer alternatives for vaccines have since been established, including attenuated viruses, inactivated or subunit viruses, non-infectious VLPs, nanoparticle delivery, and nucleic acid vaccines. 215, 216 Vaccines have been researched for a wide range of diseases, with great success for some diseases such as polio 217 and measles, 218 but some important vaccines such as for HIV and EBOV are still lacking, which are discussed below. Eliciting effective and long-term immune response is one challenge for vaccines, and the use of virus capsids offers the advantages of multivalent antigen presentation, incorporation of multiple epitopes, and particle stability. Since the field is enormous, we would like to feature just some of the research on vaccination, focusing on a few studies in the areas of infectious disease, brain disorders, and cancer. For a more comprehensive overview of virus-based particles for vaccines, the reader is invited to consult further reviews. 219, 220 In the realm of infectious diseases, HIV is particularly challenging to address due to sequence diversity and difficulty in generating broadly neutralizing antibodies. This is likely to be partially due to its structural characteristics, consisting of a low number of envelope spikes that allows it to escape recognition as foreign and increases the likelihood of evolving envelope determinants that mimic self. 221 High density display of HIV antigens is one method to combat this, with trimeric glycoproteins gp41 and gp120, as well as their precursor gp160 being highly targeted. As an example, a recent investigation studied the effect of presentation of the particularly conserved membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of HIV-1 gp41 on VLPs, and the approach produced anti-MPER antibodies that showed neutralizing activity in a rabbit model. 222 Albeit moderate, the production of neutralizing antibodies is a valuable therapeutic response that could be improved through modifying MPER presentation. Another potential target for vaccines is CCR5, a cellular self-protein found to be involved as a co-receptor for HIV replication and pathogenesis. High-density display of CCR5-based peptides on Qβ resulted in high IgG antibody titers, which was able to protect 25% of rhesus macaques against intravaginal challenge with the highly virulent SIVmac251 strain. 223 In terms of potential vaccines undergoing clinical trials, some success has been seen for the use of a treatment combining ALVAC, a canarypox vector vaccine, with boosters of AIDSVAX, a gp120 subunit vaccine, where vaccine efficacy of 31.2% was observed in a study consisting of 16,395 subjects in Thailand. 224 While work still remains to be done to improve the efficacy of HIV vaccines, great strides have been made in recent years toward its realization.
 Another area where vaccine production is of great interest is for protection from the highly virulent and deadly EBOV. Ebola VLPs have been generated consisting of glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, and VP40 matrix protein from the virus using a baculovirus expression system, and cynomolgus macaques vaccinated with the VLPs were completely protected against lethal EBOV challenge, with strong T cell responses likely contributing. 225 Further investigation of Ebola VLPs consisting of glycoprotein and VP40 also produced in insect cells demonstrated the potential of delivery without adjuvants and revealed a strong immune response that protected against lethal challenge in mice when high doses (50 μg) were utilized. 226 Optimization is still needed to enhance immunogenicity, and some prospects include improving glycoprotein incorporation during VLP assembly and including immunostimulatory molecules within the particles. A potential safer alternative to Ebola VLPs is the use of other viruses to display EBOV antigens instead. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is one such virus that has been studied, and using highly attenuated forms of VSV that have been genetically engineered to incorporate EBOV glycoprotein in place of its own has been an effective strategy, with a single dose being sufficient to protect both guinea pigs and macaques from challenge. 227 These results are highly encouraging, and it will be interesting to see if there is effective protection against other strains of EBOV.
 Aside from vaccines for human viral infections, it is of great interest to investigate animal vaccines as well for the protection of pets and livestock. An early study inserted a short epitope from the VP2 capsid protein of mink enteris virus (MEV) within the capsid of CPMV and found that it imparted protective immunity against clinical disease in mink, with a dose of 1 mg not only offering complete protection but also reducing shedding of the virus. 79 Since the epitope occurs in canine parvovirus and feline panleukopenia virus as well, the same platform could be used for protection of minks, dogs, and cats. As another example, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a highly infectious virus that affects cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle and sheep, which are important in farming. Empty FMDV capsids produced using a baculovirus system and tested in guinea pigs were able to generate neutralizing antibodies against FMDV, but at a lower level than the commercial inactivated vaccine. 228 There was still good antigenicity and immunogenicity, and use of crude protein extracts may have resulted in lower particle quantities in the experimental setup. Thus, the results are exciting for the use of noninfectious empty capsids to treat FMDV. Bluetongue virus (BTV) is another problematic disease that has been detrimental to the agricultural industry due to its high morbidity and mortality, affecting ruminants such as sheep and cattle. VLPs of BTV produced using a baculovirus expression system were found to be protective against infection when tested in sheep, with effective delivery of both singleserotype and multi-serotype cocktails and no interference observed from the presence of antibodies against other serotypes. 229 BTV VLPs can also be assembled in plants using a CPMV-based HyperTrans vector system, and vaccination with these VLPs provided protection against BTV challenge. 230 The particles were found to elicit a strong antibody response in sheep after a booster dose, comparable to live, attenuated virus used in a commercial vaccine. The development of vaccines in plant-based systems could result in cheap, easily scalable production without the danger of animal pathogen contamination. 231 Interestingly, vaccines can also be applied to brain disorders such as addiction and Alzheimer's disease. Nicotine from tobacco use is the most common drug addiction worldwide, and reduction of nicotine transport to the brain has been found to decrease dependency on the drug due to reducing stimulation of the mesolimbic reward system. 232 Nicotine covalently coupled to Qβ resulted in high drug-specific IgG antibody production in vaccinated mice, and the binding of the antibodies to nicotine caused a decrease in nicotine levels in the brain of up to 90% in individual mice. 233 Further, Phase I trials found that this approach was safe and well tolerated, with high antibody production against nicotine in all individuals. Phase II trials have demonstrated that nicotine vaccines can be effective for patients quitting smoking, but there is still room to improve antibody titers for greater efficacy. 234 Turning to Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide deposits are associated with the development of the neurodegenerative disorder and can be targeted with vaccines to reduce aggregation and ameliorate symptoms. In one study, hepatitis B virus core proteins displaying two 15-amino acid Aβ fragments taken from the N-terminus were assembled into chimeric VLPs and used in the immunization of an Alzheimer's transgenic mouse model without inclusion of additional adjuvant. 235 The VLPs elicited a potent humoral response that reduced Aβ deposition and microgliosis, and there was a resultant improvement in learning and memory, with immunized mice more readily learning and remembering the location of the hidden platform in a Morris water maze. Another therapeutic that has potential for Alzheimer's disease is CAD106, a Qβ-based vaccine displaying the first six amino acids of Aβ that is undergoing Phase II testing for long-term treatment of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. 236 Overall, multiple exposures to CAD106 resulted in a prolonged time to antibody titer decline, and the treatment had favorable safety and tolerability profiles, with no occurrences of the severe adverse responses found in Aβ antibody therapies, such as meningoencephalitis and autoimmune disease. More time is needed to observe the long-term treatment effects of the vaccine, but so far the results are promising.
 Finally, we look at the treatment of cancer through a few different immunotherapy approaches. Recently, Merck brought Gardasil 9 to market, an HPV vaccine upgrade from Gardasil that protects against 9 serotypes of HPV that account for 90% of HPV-related cancers. 237 While this is fantastic news, alternatives are necessary due to issues with cost and distribution in the developing world. Commercial vaccines are VLPs derived from the L1 major capsid protein of HPV, which is not conserved across serotypes. Thus, a simpler approach that can be more broadly protective would be more ideal. As an example, efforts have been made to produce highly immunogenic L2 VLPs that are stable over time without refrigeration. 238 Although the L2 minor capsid protein of HPV is less exposed and less immunogenic, it is highly conserved across serotypes, and MS2 displaying a short L2 peptide from HPV type 16 worked particularly well in preclinical mouse models. Reconstituted virus after spray drying remained highly immunogenic without use of an adjuvant even after 7 months of storage at room temperature, and mice vaccinated with the 16L2-MS2 VLPs were additionally protected from heterologous HPV pseudovirions of types 31 and 45, while Gardasil only protected against type 31.
 Vaccines can also be used for protection by stimulating the immune system against the cancer cells themselves. HER2 is a receptor overexpressed on breast cancers that tend to be more aggressive and is one potential target for cancer immunotherapy. Presentation of P4 378-394 , a B-cell epitope from the extracellular domain of HER2, on PVX led to higher antibody titers that were specific to HER2 compared to soluble P4 peptide alone. 239 PVXbased carriers are promising for vaccines due to their tropism toward B cells 154 and large surface area imparted by their filamentous nature leading to high multivalency. A different approach against HER2 cancer cells resulted in T cell mediated tumor prevention by utilizing the association between the minor capsid protein VP2 of murine polyomavirus (MPyV) with the internal surface of major capsid protein VP1. 240 The VP2 coat proteins were fused to HER2 1-683 and the particles were assembled in such a way that immunization of mice with the VLPs resulted in antibodies to VP1 but not HER2. On the other hand, the VLPs induced the production of HER2-specific T cells, and in both an autochthonous HER2 breast cancer mouse model and a model in which mice were challenged with HER2-positive D2F2/E2 cells (but not in a model with HER2-negative D2F2 cells), complete protection against tumor growth was observed for over 80% of the mice. Therefore, this is a potential approach for a potent prophylactic vaccine against HER2 cancer. Beside cell surface receptors, Tn antigen, a tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen, has been widely explored for presentation on viral capsids, with investigations into utilizing particles such as CPMV, TMV, and Qβ. [241] [242] [243] Although Tn is one of the weakest antigens, strategic patterned display of the antigen was able to induce a potent humoral immune response that recognized human tumor cells. Evaluation of Tn presentation for in vivo cancer protection will be an essential next step for carrying this forward as a cancer vaccine therapeutic.
 It is clear that by taking advantage of the body's natural immune system, myriad applications for virus-based vaccines can be realized. We would like to briefly highlight the application of viruses for immunotherapy as well, especially with the recent groundbreaking approval of the first oncolytic virus (OV) for cancer therapy by the FDA in October 2015. 135 T-VEC was approved for the treatment of melanoma patients and is a viral vector based on HSV type 1. The mechanism of action for OVs is not yet well understood but appears to involve both lysis from more rapid replication within tumor cells as well as promotion of systemic antitumor immune response. 244 T-VEC encodes for granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF), a cytokine involved in dendritic cell recruitment maturation that aids in additional stimulation of anti-tumor immunity. In phase III clinical trials, treatment with T-VEC led to durable responses, even for patients with advanced stage IV disease. The approval of T-VEC is a significant step forward, and future investigations will be important for enhancing efficacy through combination approaches (Figure 9 ) as well as for the establishment of safety profiles and regulatory guidelines. For more information on the action of OVs and other recent developments in this field, please refer to the following reviews. 244, 245 As a final example of the effectiveness of virus particles for immunostimulation, a recent study, in which we collaborated with the Fiering Lab at Darmouth University, demonstrated that in situ vaccination of tumors with eCPMV, just the capsid without any nucleic acid or modification, could help overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. 246 Treatment with eCPMV led to reduction and even regression of tumor growth and metastasis in a variety of mouse models, including melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, colon cancer, and breast carcinoma. eCPMV was found to specifically target and activate neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment, leading to a strong and rapid anti-tumor response. The response was found to be systemic and durable, with mice that eliminated primary B16F10 melanoma tumors through eCPMV-mediated immunity resistant to re-challenge and three out of four mice completely rejecting the tumor (Figure 10 ). Systemic protection is likely the result of immune memory against tumor antigens and mediated by T cells. These results were established for unmodified eCPMV, therefore opening the opportunity for further enhancement of efficacy through the display of antigens or the inclusion of adjuvants and chemotherapeutics.
 Overall, while there are still difficulties that exist for the development of vaccines targeting chronic diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases, progress is being made and recent results show great promise in the efficacy of some novel vaccines. The potential of VLPs for vaccines and immunotherapies is quite evident, with opportunities for the treatment of not only infectious diseases but also addiction, brain disorders, cancer, and more.
 In addition to vaccines, viruses have been applied for the delivery of full-length DNA, small interfering RNAs, and machinery for genome editing, such as nucleases, for treatment of a wide range of disorders. Gene delivery has had a long history, beginning with its initial conceptualization over 40 years ago. 247 Since then, there has been an extensive body of work dedicated to the realization of gene therapy for treatment of diseases, with Parkinson's disease, 248 cystic fibrosis, 249 hemophilia, 250 and cancer 251 being just a few examples. The extension of gene therapy for the general public is starting to become more realistic, with the approval of UniQure's Glybera for clinical use in Europe in 2012 opening the door for bringing gene therapies into the market. 252 The AAV therapy delivers the lipoprotein lipase gene to make up for deficiency in patients who cannot process triglycerides. Other gene therapies are poised to push toward commercialization in the coming year, among which includes an AAV gene therapy from Spark Therapeutics for the treatment of Leber congenital amaurosis visual impairment, which is caused by defects in the RPE65 gene. 253 Based on lack of serious adverse events from initial studies and positive phase III trial results, they are expected to advance toward filing a Biologics License Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
 The road to this point has certainly not been easy, with tragedy striking in 1999 when Jesse Gelsinger died during a clinical trial from a massive immune response instigated by the adenoviral vector meant to correct for his ornithine transcarbamoylase metabolic deficiency. 254 Only a few years later, despite great success for many children, retrovirusbased gene treatment for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency resulted in the development of leukemia in several young children as a result of gene insertion near oncogenes. 255 Despite these misfortunate and discouraging results in the past, more research has led to a better understanding of gene delivery, its potential pitfalls, and how to overcome them, leading to a lot more control over accomplishing the purpose of gene delivery with less severe and fewer adverse effects. Due to the plethora of work done in this area, we can by no means be comprehensive in our review of gene delivery, and there are many excellent reviews that we invite the reader to consult. [256] [257] [258] However, we will take a glimpse at a few studies to demonstrate the breadth of the field and the exciting studies being performed. We will then focus more on some recent developments in improving the safety profile of adenovirus and retargeting it for cell-specific delivery as well as the progress in utilizing non-mammalian viruses for gene delivery.
 Adenovirus is an icosahedral non-enveloped virus with a core diameter of 90 nm and fibers that extend from its penton bases, which allow attachment to the host cell through the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) (see Figure 1 ). 259 Following binding, adenovirus can further bind to integrin receptors through RGD displayed at the base of the fibers. The specificity of adenovirus for mammalian cells can be utilized for gene therapy for cases such as glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain cancer, with the ability to prolong time to death or reintervention. 260 This tactic works by injecting adenovirus containing cDNA for herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) around the lesion after surgical resection of the tumor. Following systemic delivery of the prodrug ganciclovir, cells that are transduced with HSV-tk can then phosphorylate the prodrug to ganciclovir triphosphate, a cytotoxic nucleotide analogue that becomes incorporated into the DNA of actively proliferating cells.
 Adenovirus gene delivery can also be utilized as an antiviral therapeutic through RNA interference (RNAi), and this has been demonstrated for HBV using delivery of anti-HBV primary microRNA (pri-miR) cassettes driven by a murine transthyretin (MTTR) promoter. 261 The promoter is a liver-specific transcription regulatory element and imparted high specificity, with barely detectable expression in non-liver cells. Furthermore, expression of anti-HBV pri-miRs resulted in knockdown of HBV replication up to 94% in mice.
 As an alternative to adenovirus delivery, AAV is particularly popular due to its very low immunogenicity, inability to self-replicate, and capacity to target non-dividing cells. 262 Stereotactic delivery of nerve growth factor (NGF) into nucleus basalis neurons in the basal forebrain has been shown to be a well-tolerated method for long-term NGF expression for the purposes of protecting patients with Alzheimer's disease from neural degeneration. 263 AAV vectors can additionally provide protection from simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). 264 Through delivery of a transgene encoding for eCD4-Ig, which binds to the CD4 envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 as well as co-receptor CCR5 with high avidity, protection from multiple infectious doses of SHIV was conferred in rhesus macaques. AAV/ phage hybrids (AAVP) have also been created in order to combine the targeting potential of phages with the transgene expression efficiency of AAV by inserting cis-regulatory elements from AAV into the M13 phage vector genome flanking the transgene cassette. 212 Using the HSV-tk and ganciclovir approach described above for adenovirus, AAVP displaying RGD peptides was able to home to sarcoma cells and instigate transgene expression and tumor regression in a rat SKLMS1 human soft-tissue sarcoma xenograft model.
 A similar outcome for combining targeting and transfection can also be achieved through covalent coating of adenovirus with a hydrophilic polymer to result in retargeting of the virus as well as protection from antibody neutralization. 155 High immunogenicity is one of the downfalls for adenovirus delivery, resulting mainly from intravascular injection, 265 and antibodies produced are primarily against the hexon capsid protein. 266 While adenovirus can still be utilized for local administration, by shielding the hexons and incorporating targeting ligands, systemic delivery with target selectivity independent of CAR is made possible. Amine-reactive pHPMA-based polymers (mentioned previously in Section 4.1.1) have been used for adenovirus coating, and further modification of the virus with targeting ligands such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 155 or antibodies against E-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) fused to IgG1 Fc 267 have been demonstrated for retargeting of adenovirus to cancer cells and tumorassociated vasculature. Additionally, pHPMA-coated adenovirus with activatable cell penetrating peptides attached enabled cytoplasmic delivery of the virus to metalloproteinaseoverexpressing tumor cells. 268 Transduction with pHPMA copolymer coatings was shown to be maintained not only in cell cultures but also in vivo in mouse models. 267, 269 PEG has also been shown to be an effective polymer for shielding 270 and retargeting. 271 As an improvement to simple PEG coatings, complexation with copolymers of PEG and PEI resulted in the ability to transduce CAR-negative NIH 3T3 cells, with the added benefit of less toxicity compared to PEI alone. 272 Aside from PEI, cationic poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers can also be used for enhancing gene delivery. Through the addition of EGFR-specific ligand GE11, dendrimer-coated adenovirus carrying the sodium iodide symporter gene (NIS) was successfully applied for radiovirotherapy in a liver cancer xenograft mouse model, in addition taking advantage of iodide for 124 I PET imaging of viral distribution. 157 While mammalian viruses have the machinery for gene transduction, phages and plant viruses also hold potential for gene delivery and gene silencing. Early phage gene delivery was reported through targeting M13 to EGF with a mammalian gene cassette inserted into the vector backbone. 273 Transduction was low but could be improved through the use of multivalent phagemid-based vectors (discussed in Section 4.2.1) and genotoxic treatment such as heat shock, UV irradiation, and camptothecin treatment. As a more practical method to overcome cellular barriers of mammalian cells, inspiration from HBV was taken and the PreS1 region of the HBV envelope protein involved in virus attachment during infection was displayed on bacteriophage T7, which resulted in more efficient gene transfer when tested in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. 274 Another hybrid phage complex, this time with cationic polymers poly-D-lysine (PDL) and diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-DEX), was also able to improve transgene expression, and cell type specificity was retained from the display of RGD. 275 Gene delivery with plant viruses is only beginning to take shape and has recently been demonstrated through assembly of CCMV coat proteins around heterologous RNA derived from Sindbis virus (SINV), which was shown to be released into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells through co-delivery of Lipofectamine-2000 ( Figure  11 ). 276 For gene silencing, MS2 phage has been especially popular for packaging of RNA. Encapsulation of a cocktail of anti-cyclin small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to silence expression of cyclin A2, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1 in MS2 was shown to protect the RNA from degradation for over 3 months when stored in the fridge. 277 Targeting these VLPs to hepatocellular carcinoma cells resulted induced apoptosis in over 90% of the cells at 150 pM siRNA concentration, with no substantial effect on the viability of normal hepatocytes. siRNA delivery with MS2 has been corroborated, with delivery of Bcl2 siRNA packaged within MS2 targeted to TfR of HeLa cells causing enhanced gene knockdown and apoptosis compared to non-targeted particles and having effectiveness similar to a commercial lipid transfection reagent. 20 miRNA-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) has also been explored, with MS2 conjugated with HIV-1 Tat 47-57 peptides shown to be able to effectively transfer encapsulated pre-miRNA into a range of cell lines and tissue types, which was processed into mature miRNA and subsequently suppressed expression of specific target gene. 278 The same group also showed packaging of antisense RNA delivered with the same Tat peptide for inhibition of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA translation. 279 While so far these studies have mainly been proof-of-concept, they suggest VLPs have much potential as gene delivery systems, with many directions for gene therapy applications.
 In addition to gene delivery, viruses can also be used for the delivery of drugs, where viruses are applied as carriers of therapeutic cargo for photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and chemotherapy. Photothermal therapy is an area whose potential has barely been tapped in the virus realm. In general, heat is produced by metallic nanostructures through the absorption of NIR or infrared light to induce hyperthermia, which can be utilized for killing susceptible tumor cells. Using such an approach, treatment can be applied to a specific area and toxicity elsewhere is reduced. So far, there has been one study, in which 1.3 nm gold was covalently attached to adenovirus and delivered to HeLa cells, where the possibility of using virus-based particles for a combination of photothermal and gene cancer therapy was discussed. 280 Other studies since then have also been successful in attaching gold to VNPs, 281, 282 but photothermal therapy using these formulations has yet to be explored.
 Photodynamic therapy, like photothermal therapy, utilizes light as a trigger, except with the effect of creating localized cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) for therapy. Initially, PDT was applied as an antimicrobial approach, using CCMV functionalized with a ruthenium-based photosensitizer and directed to Staphylococcus aureus using both an electrostatic approach with PLL and a targeted approach with an antibody for protein A, which is present in the cell wall. 283 PDT was demonstrated at standard antimicrobial fluence rates of up to 55.2 J cm −2 , with cell reduction of about 3 orders of magnitude observed and more selectivity imparted through the use of anti-protein A for targeting. Since then, PDT has been applied as a therapeutic against cancer cells. The buckyball C 60 has been attached to CPMV and Qβ to improve solubilization of the photosensitizer, 94, 284 and to aid in delivery to and treatment of PC-3 prostate cancer cells. 284 Internal conjugation of porphyrins to MS2 combined with external display of aptamers for protein tyrosine kinase 7 receptors on Jurkat leukemia T cells has been established for selective killing of Jurkat cells when cultured with erythrocytes after 20 min of illumination at 415 nm. 285 Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, glycan decoration of Qβ was shown to be an effective strategy for targeting cells bearing CD22 receptors that are involved in the regulation of B cells, and this was illustrated with the delivery of metalloporphyrins for specific elimination of CD22positive cells. 286 To move toward clinical application of PDT, use of photosensizers that can be excited in the NIR range would be more ideal for better tissue penetration. Phthalocyanine dyes are one such class of photosensitizers, and self-assembly of CCMV with phthalocyanine encapsulated has been explored recently. 125, 287 CCMV coencapsulated with Gd(DOTA) micelles and phthalocyanine dyes resulted in better capsid stability and further imparts the possibility to perform combination therapy and MR imaging, 287 and thus it only remains to investigate their potential value in PDT.
 Virus-based and other nanoparticles have also been developed for the delivery of chemotherapies. Chemotherapy is associated with dose-limiting toxicities, and specific delivery to cancer cells using carrier systems increases safety as well as targeted payload delivery. 288, 289 In particular, doxorubicin (Dox) delivery has been studied extensively, likely popular in part due to the clinical success of Doxil, a liposomal formulation of Dox. 290 Dox works through intercalating into DNA and causing oxidative DNA damage. 291 Conjugation of Dox can be achieved by pH-cleavable hydrazone linkages, as demonstrated in one study where an alkyne-functionalized hydrazone linker was used for attachment to azidefunctionalized polymers grown from the capsid of Qβ by ATRP. 105 In such a manner, the Dox could then be subsequently released by low pH cleavage of the linker after particle uptake, which was shown to maintain efficacy in the killing of HeLa cells. Methods for conjugation have also been recently established for spheres made from thermal transitioning of TMV and utilized for the loading of doxorubicin, which was found to be effective for chemotherapeutic delivery to breast cancer cells. 292 Besides chemical conjugation, Dox can be loaded by infusion into RCNMV and incorporated into a fibrous matrix made up of polylactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) nanofibers. 113 The combination of the two systems could be tailored to result in either a two-phase release profile or a first order release profile, depending on whether the virus was co-spun with the fibers or the matrix immersed in the virus solution after electrospinning, respectively.
 Specific delivery of Dox to cells has been achieved through conjugation of FA to HCRSV and CMV, 163, 184 SPARC binding peptides to M13, 293 and peptides for CD46 receptor and N-cadherin targeting to RCNMV, 294 as well as by utilizing CPMV's natural interactions with surface vimentin. 295 For instance, with Dox encapsulated within Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (HCRSV) further conjugated with FA, more efficient inhibition of OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cell growth was achieved, while no difference in drug efficacy was observed when CCL-186 human diploid fibroblast cells were tested as a control for normal cells ( Figure  12 ). 184 As another example, CPMV was used for treatment of HeLa cells through the display of Dox attached either by a direct covalent bond or through a disulfide linker. 295 With the disulfide linkage, the cell killing was similar to free Dox, likely due to release of the drug in cell culture media before particle uptake, but covalent attachment of Dox to CPMV resulted in more efficient cell killing than free Dox, with almost complete elimination of the cells at a concentration of 1.45 μM for the CPMV formulation whereas cells treated with free Dox were still completely viable.
 Virus-based platforms have also been explored for the co-delivery of therapies. In one study, M13 was investigated for its feasibility in delivering hygromycin and Dox specifically to either SKBR3 human breast adenocarcinoma cells that overexpress HER2 or A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells that overexpress EGFR. 296 Dox delivery was successful and was shown to require a cathepsin-B cleavable peptide linker for efficacy, but delivery of hygromycin was particularly impressive, with over a 1000-fold improvement in potency compared to free drug administration. However, different targeting strategies were used, making it difficult to draw conclusions as to the relative efficacy of the two drugs. Another study assessed the range of therapeutic cargo that could be encapsulated within MS2, including doxorubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), along with ricin toxin A-chain (RTA). 277 Using SP94-targeted formulations that bind to Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells with 10 4 -fold higher avidity compared to other cell types, the encapsulation of Dox individually was shown to be more effective than free Dox, while encapsulation of a cocktail comprised of all three chemotherapeutics was even more effective, with an IC 50 concentration below 1 nM. Delivery of the toxin RTA was also remarkable, with almost complete elimination of Hep3B cells at a concentration of 100 fM without affecting the viability of control cells.
 While the targeted chemotherapeutic cocktail above was highly effective, other approaches using prodrugs have also been investigated to further reduce the risk of toxicity. For example, instead of direct delivery of 5-FU as a treatment option, encapsulation of the enzyme yeast cytosine deaminase (yCD) is an alternative method that results in the presence of 5-FU in the target cell by conversion of 5-fluorocytosine and as a consequence causes target cell death. 297 In another study that utilized conversion of a prodrug, delivery of an exogenous protein horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was demonstrated with M13 displaying Ypep2 peptides, which have selectivity for PC-3 prostate cancer cells. 298 After delivery, HRP was able to oxidize indole-3-acetic acid to produce a peroxyl radical that led to cytotoxicity.
 Other anticancer drugs that have been investigated for virus-based nanoparticle delivery include taxol, 299 bortezomib (or BTZ), 300 and trastuzumab (or Herceptin). 144 Cardiovascular disease is another route for virus-based therapeutic intervention, and CPMV delivery of chromium has shown promise for protecting against diabetic atherosclerosis in vascular smooth muscle cells. 301 Additionally, filamentous phages have been applied for the delivery of antibacterial agents, including neomycin and chloramphenicol for growth inhibition of E. coli, S. aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. 302, 303 Antiviral delivery with viral vectors is a new development, and the similar tropism of the plant virus CPMV to antigen presenting cells that are commonly subverted by pathogenic viruses was exploited for combatting chronic infectious disease caused by the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomenigitis virus. 111 Only very recently was drug delivery with VNPs or VLPs demonstrated in vivo. 304 Since TMV is a hollow nanotube with a negatively charged interior channel, it could be taken advantage of for the loading of cationic drugs. The highly potent platinum DNA-binding drug phenanthriplatin was introduced within the carrier and shown to be released under acidic conditions. When TMV delivery of phenanthriplatin was applied in a triple negative breast cancer mouse xenograft model, much greater efficacy was observed for TMVphenanthriplatin compared to free drug or clinically used cisplatin controls, with 4-fold smaller tumor growth. This is likely due to better transport of the drug to the tumor cells with the nanocarrier. The combination of TMV and phenanthriplatin shows potential for bringing an effective new chemotherapy into the clinic, but virus-based nanoparticle drug delivery is a quickly growing field, and it is expected that progression toward other clinical applications is also fast approaching.
 Tissue engineering-Viruses have been incorporated into biocompatible tissue engineering scaffolds for directing cell growth, alignment, and differentiation. The neighboring environment affects the behavior of cells, both in terms biological cues such as presence of chemokines and ligand as well as physical cues such as topology and mechanical moduli. Using this knowledge, scaffolds can be designed to regulate cells in a manner suitable for applications in the repair or replacement of damaged tissue.
 As a first step, cell adhesion to viral scaffolds was investigated. Pioneering work utilized layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of CPMV and polymer poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) to form thin films that were found to aid in the adhesion and proliferation of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, with more layers leading to more CPMV adsorption and greater cell adhesion. 305 Research then moved toward the use of filamentous viruses, as they better mimic the structure of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Coating of TMV with different cell binding motifs derived from integrin binding matrix proteins collagen and fibronectin onto a high binding plate demonstrated that the peptide sequence displayed plays a role in cell adhesion and morphology. 306 While cells cultured on TMV with RGD motifs formed filopodial extensions, they adhered more weakly compared to cells that remained rounded when cultured on TMV displaying P15, a collagen I mimetic sequence. For screening the influence of various biochemical cues on cell proliferation and morphology, phage-chips have been constructed such that arrays of M13 nanofibers labeled with various peptides or growth factors and self-assembled on gold chips can be monitored using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy for their effect on cultured cells. 307 Further progression toward mimicking the ECM looked at synthesizing fibrous matrices through electrospinning of RGD-modified viruses with polymers. 308, 309 Nanofibers made up of TMV with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) 308 and M13 with poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) 309 formed biodegradable fibrous matrices that enhanced cell adhesion, proliferation, and spreading of baby hamster kidney (BHK) and fibroblast cells, respectively, compared to scaffolds of the polymers alone.
 As an advancement from cell adhesion and proliferation, external stimulus can also direct the orientation of cell growth, which is important for the function of many cell types such as cardiac and skeletal myocytes. Taking advantage of available viruses with elongated geometries, M13 and TMV have been utilized for cell alignment. In an early study, M13 with RGD motifs was self-assembled into parallel arrangements through slow drying or dragging methods to form thin films on which oriented growth of NIH-3T3 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were achieved, with the shear method producing the most consistent results. 310 Investigation of the ECM deposited by cells cultured on these films revealed correlation between cellular alignment and the orientation of fibronectin and collagen I deposition. 311 NIH-3T3 fibroblasts produced more ECM proteins, which resulted in more of a tendency to deviate from the original patterning, and thus the fibroblasts displayed reduced alignment over time as well as when compared with less ECM-producing BHK cells. Other methods for the alignment of viral nanorods, and subsequently cells, include shearing force from fluid flow through glass capillaries 312, 313 and microcontact printing combined with dip-coating. 314 Myogenic differentiation of myoblast cells can be achieved through exposure to differentiation media after oriented cell growth. 313 In addition to forming 2D films, fabrication of 3D aligned fibers is possible based on interfacial polyionic complexation, which was demonstrated by injecting negatively charged, RGD-labeled M13 phage into a solution of cationic polymers PEI, PLL, and chitosan. 315 NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells encapsulated through co-injection with the phage solution grew well within the fibers and after seven days began to spread along the matrix within the phage fibers, demonstrating the potential of virus scaffolds for cell growth and remodeling. 3D tissue cultures have also been formed through treatment of cells with hydrogels that can then be magnetically levitated, and cell clustering could be controlled by the magnetic field profiles of the magnets used. 316 Hydrogels were fabricated through simple combination of solutions of gold nanoparticles with M13 displaying RGD, 317, 318 with the additional inclusion of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for levitation. The 3D cell cultures were able to recapitulate in vivo behavior, as observed by similar protein expression patterns as well as infiltration of highly invasive glioblastoma cells when co-cultured with astrocytes.
 An application of phage nanofiber formation is the growth and differentiation of neural cells. Fibers containing M13 displaying RGD or IKVAV, a laminin motif that plays a role in neural cell adhesion and neurite extension, were shown to be advantageous for neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation and differentiation, with extension of neurites parallel the fibers observed. 82 The cell binding motifs are crucial for inducing neural cell growth, and it has been demonstrated that using a control RGE peptide results in a drastic decrease in cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth. 319 There is a range of cell binding peptides derived from fibronectin and collagen that have been investigated and found to be effective for supporting neural growth and enhancing neurite extension, 320 and it would be of interest to further study the specific interactions between the cells and the scaffold to better understand the roles of the peptides in cell differentiation. In addition to cell binding motifs, immobilization of growth factors to phages has been demonstrated to retain bioactivity, with bFGF shown to promote NPC proliferation and NGF leading to greater neural differentiation. 321 Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that electroactivity could also be used to augment neural tissue regeneration. 322 TMV that was modified with polyaniline and further doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) was aligned by flow through capillary tubes and shown to increase the percentage of cells with neurite outgrowths as well as the percentage of cells with bipolar morphology.
 Virus scaffolds are not limited to neural differentiation, and by far the most extensive research has been performed in osteogenic differentiation. An early study looked at osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells on icosahedral turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV). 323 Osteocalcin gene expression and onset of mineralization were found 7 days earlier for cells grown on TYMV-coated substrates compared to tissue culture plastic when cultured in osteogenic media, indicating the nanotopology imparted by the TYMV supports osteogenic differentiation. Similar data was found for substrates coated with rodshaped TMV, with further DNA microarray data showing differential expression in a large panel of genes and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) in particular found to be especially important in osteogenic differentiation in this manner. 324 There was a rapid onset in BMP2 gene and protein expression, and this enhancement was only found when TMV was coated on the substrate and not when added to the cell media, verifying the role of nanotopology. 325 Additional conjugation of phosphate groups to the exterior of TMV further boosted differentiation by aiding in the incorporation of calcium and consequently highly enriched mineralization of the ECM. 326 A related strategy for mineralization utilized genetic engineering to display highly negatively charged E 8 peptides on M13 phage, which could then be self-assembled into nanofibers in the presence of calcium ions and led to hydroxyapatite formation with the addition of phosphate ions. 327 The effect of multivalent presentation of various ligands has also been studied, and rapid differentiation and nodule formation was observed for substrates with TMV coated with RGD after only 2 days in serum-free osteogenic media. 328 While this was found for TMV genetically engineered to display RGD, TMV chemically conjugated to RGD also enhanced bone differentiation. 329 In the absence of osteogenic supplements, presentation of RGD with the addition of synergy peptide PHSRN on M13 was actually found to be sufficient to induce osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). 330 Display of DGEA peptide derived from collagen. 331 along with PDPLEPRREVCE derived from osteocalcin and YGFGG derived from osteogenic growth peptide 332 on M13 have also been shown to accelerate proliferation and differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts. M13 is capable of selfassembly into long-range ordered morphologies using dip-coating methods, forming nematic orthogonal twists, cholesteric helical ribbons, and smectic helicolidal nanofilaments based on conditions such as phage concentration and pulling speed. 333 Films formed using RGD and EEEE peptide-labeled phages could be used to control both soft and hard tissue formation, with smectic hilcolidal nanofilament surfaces in particular demonstrated to form enamel-like composites when treated with calcium and phosphate ions. Moving toward 3D scaffolds, TMV-RGD was incorporated within porous alginate hydrogels and resultantly produced greater cell attachment and enhanced osteogenic differentiation. 83 3D printed scaffolds composed of hydroxyapatite and β-tricalcium phosphate is another approach, and introduction of M13-RGD combined with chitosan within the scaffold pore not only led to osteogenesis but also angiogenesis, with inclusion of VEGF further enhancing the effect (Figure 13) . 334 A new direction in this area is the incorporation of gene delivery within tissue engineering constructs. Mutant FLAG-tagged AAV was tethered to scaffolds made up of PLGA and gelatin sponge through anti-FLAG antibodies, and virus transduction was observed when HeLa cells were seeded onto the scaffold, both in vitro and when implanted in vivo into nude mice. 335 Furthermore, transduction was observed for cells cultured on drop-cast films consisting of hybrid phages constructed from the combination of M13-RGD phage with an AAV-derived gene cassette. 336 While still in its early stages, with further developments, tissue regeneration and reprogramming of cellular defects could be made possible through the combination of tissue engineering and gene delivery.
 For future translation of virus-based tissue scaffolds, the immunogenicity and long-term effects of the viruses must be considered. Investigation of the in vivo behavior of implanted porous alginate hydrogels containing TMV and TMV-RGD revealed good biocompatibility, as evidenced by normal wound healing, hydrogel biodegradation over time, no pathological inflammation, and very little immune response triggered as opposed to intramuscular injection of native TMV. 337 In addition to degradation of the hydrogel, it is expected that the protein-based viruses will also be degraded over time by cell proteinases, thus mitigating concerns of the implications of long-term deposition of the material. Since previous work has shown that viral substrates can be utilized for rapid differentiation in serum-free media, thus without the presence of xenogeneic proteins and growth factors, 328 implantation of tissue scaffolds after ex vivo culturing of cells is a tangible reality.
 In the realm of biotechnology, viruses have found use for a variety of applications including peptide display technologies, confined synthesis, multiplexed sensors, diagnostics, nanoreactors, catalysts, as well as agriculture, several examples of which are discussed in the following sections.
 The first of these technologies we will cover is phage display, which is routinely applied for a myriad of applications. The display of foreign sequences on filamentous phages was first described by George Smith in 1985. 338 Since then, it has become a prominent method for the selection of peptides and antibodies that have affinity for specific targets, encompassing both organic and inorganic matter. Many reviews have been written that delve into the depths of phage display technology. [339] [340] [341] [342] [343] Our aim in this section is to discuss the characteristics of phage display and highlight a few of the interesting studies and some of the latest applications.
 Based on the original research in which f1 phage was studied, 338 E. coli filamentous bacteriophages, which include f1, fd, and M13, are some of the more common platforms utilized for phage display. The general structure of filamentous phages is shown in Figure  14 , 344 which illustrates how the phages are comprised of a number of minor and major coat proteins. Out of these, the pIII and pVIII proteins are what are usually utilized for the display of foreign proteins, 345 likely due to greater accessibility at the tip and sides, respectively, but display with pVI, 346 pVII, 347, 348 and pIX 348 have also been successfully implemented. In brief, phage display utilizes the genetic programming of the phage coat proteins; insertion of random sequences of DNA within the protein genes can be used to form a library of phages with billions of different foreign peptides or proteins presented. 342 After several rounds of panning and amplification to isolate the specific phages that bind to a target, the identity of the binding peptides or proteins displayed can be determined through sequencing. Whereas insertions at pVIII are limited to around 9-mers, 349 cyclic phage libraries 350 and libraries displaying sequences of up to 38 random residues on pIII are possible. 351 Phage display is not only limited to filamentous phages, as libraries based on other phages such as lambda and T7 are also possible. 352, 353 Another alternative that has proven useful in phage display is the use of phagemids. 354 Phagemids typically contain traditional plasmid aspects, with a plasmid replication origin, restriction enzyme recognition sites, and an antibiotic selection marker, as well as phage aspects, including a phage origin of replication and a gene for pIII fused to any protein of interest (Figure 15 ). 355 By co-infection with a helper phage to supply other structural proteins required for phage formation, complete virions assembled around phagemid DNA can be recovered. The advantages of using phagemids include ease of cloning and recombination, more efficient transformation, a smaller genome for incorporation of larger foreign genes, and greater genetic stability over multiple rounds of propagation. 354 Phage and phagemid display technology have given rise to numerous opportunities for the isolation of protein-based ligands for a range of applications. In its simplest form, screening can be performed in vitro, where the target of interest is immobilized on a solid support.
 Using this technique, peptides have been identified that are specific for targets that include inorganic materials such as hydroxyapatite, 356 silver, 357 and quantum dots, 13 as well as organic materials such as microtubules, 358 fibrin, 359 and integrins. 360 As some examples, these binding peptides can be used for biomineralization for formation of hard tissue 356 as well as for nucleation, growth, and patterning of metals. 357 It should be noted that many of the examples found in other sections that involve mineralization rely on the use of metal binding peptides for nucleation. Additionally, peptides can be selected that not only bind but also obstruct the function of its targets, such as demonstrated with peptides identified for inhibition of proteases such as human neutrophil elastase, 361 as well as cancer-associated matrix metalloproteinases. 362 The versatility of the technology can be expanded beyond peptide identification. For example, phage libraries can be designed for the display Fab antigen-binding fragments and scFvs, 339 which has implications for identification of antibodies for bioassays as well as immunotherapy. Some examples include the construction of a Fab phage display library for the isolation of antibodies specific to human prostate cancer cells 363 and the generation and identification of scFv antibodies that recognize a marker of angiogenesis, VEGFR-3. 364 Besides Fabs and scFvs, an alternative method of display where the antibody heavy-and light-chain variable regions were separately displayed on pVII and pIX, respectively, was demonstrated to effectively drive the formation of functional Fv heterodimers, which may have greater affinity and stability compared to scFvs. 365 Enzymes and their substrates can also be displayed on phages, either independently or together on a single particle, in order to screen for functional enzyme catalysts. 366 Co-presentation of the enzyme and substrate can be achieved using an intervening linker between the two, and then active enzymes can be selected for by panning for product formation. 367 Aside from immobilization of isolated targets on a surface, selection methods have also been demonstrated with cultured cells, as well as ex vivo and in vivo, to select for cell binding peptides. 343 Using panning against cell lines of various types, such as fibroblasts and myoblasts, 368 peptides with high cellular specificity can be identified. In this manner, peptides have been isolated that have specificity for endothelial cells associated with atherosclerosis, 369 breast cancer cells, 370 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, 371 melanoma cells, 372 and ovarian cells, 373 among others. Ex vivo panning works similarly, except the library is screened against cells or tumor masses that have been isolated, and binding peptides have been identified for a range of cell types that include neuroblastoma cells, 374 islet cells, 375 and colonic adenoma cells. 376 In vivo phage display is particularly noteworthy and lends itself to many different applications. For example, peptides targeting specific organs can be examined using in vivo screening of random peptides in a mouse model. 377 After multiple rounds of phage administration, isolation, and amplification, peptides that localize to the brain and kidney were identified. Furthermore, attachment of brain targeting peptides to fixed red blood cells resulted in the accumulation of the cells in the brain at a greater extent than the kidneys. Another investigation that also studied kidney targeting in vivo found that peptide specificity could be used for the tailoring of pharmacokinetics. 378 By directing clearance toward the kidneys and away from the reticuloendothelial system, more rapid clearance could be achieved. In vivo screening has also been applied in humans for the mapping of unique zip codes lining the vasculature. 379 Unique tripeptide motifs specific for various regions around the body were identified after biopsies of the bone marrow, fat tissue, skeletal muscle, prostate, skin, and liver were performed, which could be utilized toward the creation of a map of molecular signatures along the human vasculature.
 As the above examples indicate, the reach of phage display applications is extensive and encompasses mineralization, in vitro assays, targeted delivery, molecular imaging, vaccines, and tissue engineering.
 The multivalency of viruses can be applied for sensing and multiplexed systems; the high degree of multivalency has been shown to improve the detection limit in a number of settings. Phages identified from a library against the desired target sequence can be directly applied as sensors. Genetic engineering simplifies the manufacture of large quantities of phages displaying specific targeting moieties, and several reviews cover the wide range of sensing applications available for these materials. 380, 381 Besides phages, many other virus-based platform technologies have also been developed for signal detection and amplification. In our examples, we will cover the broad range of virus-based materials incorporated in manifold sensing technologies, which include antibody-based, electrochemical, and optical techniques.
 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a traditional technique for the detection of target antigens. 382 Although several variations exist, it generally relies on three components: (1) a probe specific for the target, (2) an antibody tagged with an enzyme to detect the probe, and (3) a substrate that is converted in the presence of the enzyme. The first probe tends to also be an antibody with specificity for the target, but phage display has introduced the opportunity for using peptides for target recognition. For example, phages decorated with peptides isolated from phage display have been used in ELISAs for the detection of anthrax spores 383 and the surface antigen of HBV. 384 For an alternative to the presentation of peptides on viruses, antibodies can also be presented on the viral scaffold for multivalent detection, and the previous section discussed how phage display and genetic engineering could be used for the display of antibodies and fragments thereof. As another approach, it was recently demonstrated that functionalization of PVX-based nanoparticles with protein A fragments can be used to display whole antibody molecules by using protein A's property of binding to the Fc region of the heavy chain of IgGs. 85 The PVX particles could then be used as a plug-and-play system for the display of a variety of antibodies, with a level of orientational control not achievable with chemical conjugation.
 Instead of sample immobilization followed by probing for antigens in the sample with a virus-based detector, viruses displaying antigens could first be immobilized before incubation with the sample to detect for the presence of certain antibodies. 385 This was demonstrated as a successful approach for the diagnosis of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSjS), a chronic systemic autoimmune disease whose heterogeneity often delays diagnosis. Lipo peptide derived from the human autoantigen lipocalin was displayed on PVX, and the nanoparticle platform was shown to be specific to pSjS patient sera and had greater reactivity than the peptide alone. On the other hand, eCPMV-based display of lipo was not reactive, likely due to a smaller density of peptide display. Regardless, the PVX ELISA has promise for future implementation, and an additional benefit found was the stability of the coating, with no loss of specificity or sensitivity observed even after two months of storage at 4°C.
 Another aspect of ELISAs is the enzyme used for quantification via substrate conversion. HRP is a popular enzyme for ELISAs due to its ability to convert chromogenic substrates into colored products and chemiluminescent substrates into fluorescent products. 382 Immobilization of HRP, as well as glucose oxidase (GOX), has been explored using CPMV 386 and TMV 387 platforms. While the addition of sensing molecules to the virions will be required for their use in ELISAs, the display of the enzymes themselves on the particles can be directly used for sensing. GOX catalyzes the oxidation of glucose and concurrently generates hydrogen peroxide, which can then be reduced to water by HRP in the presence of a substrate. Therefore, the two enzymes can be coupled to form a glucose sensing system, where HRP substrate conversion can be used for detection. In fact, the TMV nanorods resulted in up to 45-fold higher substrate conversion rates than control samples with the same input of enzymes, which could be due to a combination of a greater surface area and better steric accessibility of the presented enzymes. This is only one example of the potential of enzyme-based sensors, and the immobilization of enzymes that catalyze other reactions could also be considered for the creation of sensitive biosensors.
 The output of immunosorbent assays need not be enzyme-linked, and an alternative readout options include fluorescence from the particles. For example, phages isolated after panning against staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), an agent that can cause food poisoning, were labeled with the fluorophore Cy5 and used to probe for SEB. 388 Based on fluorescence readings, SEB was detectable down to a concentration of 1.4 ng/well. As another example, dye-labeled CPMV conjugated with antibodies was used for the detection of SEB, botulinum toxin, and the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni. 389 The detection of SEB was specifically quantified, and the limit of detection was improved for the CPMV formulation when compared with a mole equivalent of dye-labeled antibody.
 Fluorescence can be used for other sensing functions, such as found with the application of fluorescently labeled CPMV to DNA microarray sensors. 390 By additionally coupling NeutrAvidin to the capsid, the CPMV could be used as a detection reagent. One result of the investigation demonstrated that the delivery of multiple dyes using CPMV resulted in signal amplification and led to the detection of 14% more genes compared to the control in a rat expression array (Figure 16) . Another fluorescence sensing application utilized LbL assembly of M13 labeled with quantum dots along with quenchers that can be displayed by the explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). 391 The design of the M13 film allowed for highly selective detection of TNT at a sub ppb level through the evolution of fluorescence signal when the quenchers were displaced.
 Optical sensors also encompass those that utilize SPR for detection. For example, LbL assembly of cationic M13 with anionic gold nanoparticles resulted in the development of an SPR spectrum that was sensitive to humidity. 392 It is therefore possible to utilize electrostatic assembly to integrate viruses in humidity sensing devices. SPR has also been applied as sensors for immunoassays, such as exemplified by the detection of the food-borne bacterium Listeria monocytogenes using a gold SPR sensor chip. 393 M13 displaying an scFv antibody recognizing L. monocytogenes cells was immobilized on the sensor chip before injection of samples for measurement. The change in resonance due to the binding of cells allowed for specific detection down to levels of around 2 × 10 6 cfu/mL. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been another approach that has been considered for sensing. 394 It relies on signal enhancement of the Raman signal when in close proximity to the surface of a noble metal. Due to the sensitivity of the technique and the unique signature of various reporters, SERS is a promising technique for multiplexed analysis. M13 phage, selected by phage display for binding to the model rabbit anti-goat IgG antigen, was labeled with Cy3 Raman reporters that were conjugated to Au@Ag core-shell nanoparticles. Due to a high surface area for reporter presentation, the resultant M13 construct imparted an exponential increase in the Raman intensity observed when compared to similarly labeled antibodies against the model antigen. M13 has also been applied in a colorimetric sensor that was based on changes in the modulation of its self-assembled structure, but this application is discussed in more detail in Section 4.3.1. 395 Besides optical sensing, viruses have also found application in electrochemical sensing. The three different examples we will highlight involve electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 396 and amperometry 397, 398 for measurements. In the first example, a gold electrode surface on which a M13 monolayer was attached was used for the detection of an antibody as well as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a marker of prostate cancer. 396 The resistive component of the impedance, Z Re , measured from 2 to 500 kHz, increased upon analyte binding, and measurement of this characteristic could be used for highly specific detection of down to concentrations of around 100 nM. In the next example, a thin film of TMV conjugated with electroactive oligoaniline was used for the detection of volatile organic compounds, specifically methanol and ethanol. 397 The response current was measured from the thin film sensor, and there was a high response observed in the presence of ethanol and methanol over what was observed for acetonitrile, isobutyl alcohol, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, and acetone. Moreover, the current measurements exhibited reproducibility as well as a quick response time for both absorption and desorption of the compounds. Finally, the last example involves the application of a solution of TMV displaying binding peptides for TNT for in-solution sensing of the molecule. 398 As a result of binding of TNT to TMV, the diffusion coefficient of the TNT was reduced and a differential Faradaic current signature of the electroactive compound was caused. The differential current was proportional to TNT concentration and therefore could be used for TNT sensing. Detection using this method is not limited to just TNT and can be expanded to other relatively small electroactive species.
 sensing approach, which is widely applied for disease diagnostics, involves using assays that detect and amplify the nucleic acid content of infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses. [399] [400] [401] Quality control is an important consideration to ensure results from these assays are accurate. For example, failures with the well-known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay could occur due to nucleic acid degradation or the presence of inhibitors such as bile salts and polysaccharides in clinical samples, which could potentially lead to reduction in polymerase binding or activity. 402 False negatives due to failures during processing may be monitored by incorporating known RNA or DNA into samples to serve as a positive internal control to verify that nucleic acid degradation did not occur during processing.
 To this end, viral capsids have found utility due to their ability to shield nucleic acids from nuclease digestion, serving as a better mimic for use in viral assays and allowing for longterm storage of the controls. The design of so-called ""Armored RNA"" (developed and patented by Asuragen and Cenetron Diagnostics) was the first such development and functions as a well-characterized control that is resistant to RNase. 403 Armored RNA is comprised of an RNA standard sequence encapsulated within an MS2 capsid, which can be co-produced using an expression vector in E. coli (Figure 17) . If so desired, the RNA within these particles can be subsequently released through heating at 70°C for 5 minutes. In the pioneering study, the control was tested in an HIV reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay using a non-infectious consensus sequence taken from the HIV-1 gag gene. The Armored RNA particles were found to be stable in anticoagulated plasma with no loss in signal after storage in a variety of conditions: 4°C for 2 months, −20°C for 6 months, and even after five freeze-thaw cycles.
 Since these initial results, Armored RNA has been applied as a control for a vast array of assays, which include the detection of HCV, [404] [405] [406] respiratory viruses such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses, [407] [408] [409] enteroviruses, 410, 411 and West Nile virus. 412 It has even been utilized as a surrogate virus for the detection of animal pathogens, including classical swine fever virus (CSFV), FMDV, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). 413 Several developments in the technology have been made to enhance the utility of Armored RNA. In the original area of HIV detection, Armored RNA was expanded beyond RT-PCR assays to the branched DNA (bDNA) assay, which provides a reliable method for quantification of HIV-1 RNA but requires a longer 3 kb RNA control. 414 The standard strategy for RNA encapsulation within MS2 is limited to only around 2 kb, but increasing the packaging efficiency to overcome this limit can be achieved through incorporating more translational repressor stem-loops within the RNA, which specifically interact with the MS2 capsid and trigger the self-assembly of the viral shell around the cargo. 415 In such a manner, Armored RNA containing the longer HIV pol gene was successfully synthesized and performed reliably as a standard for the bDNA assay. 414 HCV Armored RNA has also been developed for RT-PCR and bDNA assays, and additional work demonstrated its applicability in genotyping assays as well, allowing the distinction of a specific subtype of HCV. 404 For real-time RT-PCR reactions, false negatives could occur when a singleplex primer/probe assay is used since mismatches with a set of primers could exist in a number of samples, thus dual-specific RNA controls in duplex assays were tested, and resultant enhancement in the sensitivity of detection was found compared to monospecific assays. 405, 416 Beyond controls for the detection of single virus types, Armored RNA chimeras have also been created. 407, 417 In one study, a chimeric RNA sequence was derived from a mix of gene fragments from HCV, HIV-1, SARS coronavirus 1, and SARS coronavirus 2. 417 They were able to package the fairly large 1.2 kb RNA sequence within MS2 and demonstrate its versatility as a control for the multiple different RT-PCR assays for the detection of each individual virus. In another study, RNA fragments from influenza A, influenza B, and SARS viruses were spliced together into one fragment in order to create a single control for the simultaneous testing of these common respiratory viruses that may result in similar clinical symptoms. 407 Using multiplex RT-PCR for the three viruses with different reporter dyes, simultaneous amplification and detection could be achieved with a highly sensitive detection limit of 10 1 copies/μl of the Armored RNA for all the viruses.
 A natural extension of Armored RNA technology is the encapsulation of DNA within a bacteriophage capsid for quality control of DNA viruses. Early work in this area utilized lambda and filamentous fd phages for DNA packaging, and greater stability of the DNA was observed. [418] [419] [420] Containment of control dsDNA within lambda phage conferred resistance to DNase digestion, with reliable amplification in PCR assays for HBV 418, 419 and cytomegalovirus. 418 When stored in SM buffer, the protected DNA was stable for at least a few months, but stability for more than 5 days in plasma at room temperature could not be achieved, which may be a result of greater susceptibility of lambda to plasma proteases compared to MS2. 418, 419 For ssDNA, encapsulation in fd phage was demonstrated with DNA taken from parvovirus B19. 420 The resultant controls were resistant to nuclease degradation and performed similarly to the native virus in PCR assays, with very similar growth curves observed. Furthermore, the constructs remained stable at both 37°C and 45°C when diluted in human plasma for periods of at least 4 weeks. More recently, a return to the Armored RNA roots was taken with the demonstration of encapsulation of dsDNA in MS2, which resulted in extra stability over lambda as was found for fd phage but without being limited to ssDNA. 421 By conjugating sulfhydryl-modified DNA sequences of interest to an amine-modified stem-loop DNA structure, assembly of dissociated MS2 CPs could then be triggered around the stem-loops to form Armored DNA. Using this strategy, the formation of MS2 capsids packaging HBV and HPV DNA sequences with lengths ranging from 1.3 to 6.5 kb was accomplished, which is astonishing given that the genome of MS2 is only 3.5 kb. The Armored DNA controls performed well in PCR and genotyping assays, and storage in newborn calf serum even after 6 months at 4 °C was shown to not affect performance.
 Encapsulated controls are not only limited to bacteriophages. For example, recombinant RNA particles based on CPMV can also be utilized as internal controls for RT-PCR assays. 422 To produce these particles, a cDNA clone was engineered to contain sequences for the desired control RNA alongside RNA-2 of CPMV, which codes for its coat and movement proteins. In the proof-of-concept study, two sequences from FMDV and one from swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) were cloned together into the cassette. Using agroinfiltration of cowpea plants with the combination of this plasmid along with another plasmid for RNA-1 of CPMV, which is responsible for its replication and proteolytic processing, recombinant CPMV particles were propagated in and recovered from their host plant. The CPMV component containing RNA-2 was separated from the RNA-1 component using a Nycodenz density gradient, resulting in a non-infectious construct due to its reliance on RNA-1 for replication. The particles performed well as positive controls for the detection of both FMDV and SVDV. Additionally, they were resistant to RNase and performed reliably even after 33 days storage in a 10% suspension of bovine epithelium at room temperature. This method may provide a low cost alternative to Armored RNA, while maintaining the advantages of stability and rapid production.
 Another alternative utilizes TMV coat proteins for assembly of a positive control, with the helical symmetry of the resultant particle more realistically mimicking the stability of filamentous viruses. This approach was recently demonstrated for RT-PCR detection of EBOV. 423 To construct the EBOV-TMV mimic, purified CP from TMV was reassembled around an RNA transcript containing an EBOV sequence fragment and a shortened TMV sequence containing the origin of assembly (OAS) necessary for TMV assembly ( Figure  18 ). The EBOV sequence was taken from a region in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (L-gene) that showed homology between all published EBOV sequences. Detection of both the EBOV and TMV sequences was accomplished using multiplex RT-PCR with the EBOV-TMV particle. Aside from the EBOV primer binding sites, the EBOV sequence was scrambled, therefore posing no threat of infection. Overall, EBOV-TMV is a scalable construct that could be easily adapted as a control for EBOV diagnostics, and the technology could be further applied for mimicking other filamentous viruses.
 One of the first demonstrations of the utility of using viruses for the display of biocatalysts was based on genetic engineering of PVX to display a lipase enzyme. 424 Although the catalytic activity of the bound enzyme was lower than the free enzyme, the study demonstrated the potential for generating catalytically active nanoparticles that can self-assemble and be easily propagated. Since then, interest in the functionalization of virus particles with enzymes has grown. Coupled with the ability of the viral capsid to self-assemble around a diverse range of cargo rather than simply nucleic acids, encapsulation of enzymes to form nanoreactors has become of increasing relevance to biotechnology.
 Initial work with the formation of such nanoreactors looked at the incorporation of a single enzyme within the capsid. Through disassembly and reassembly of the capsid, HRP was encapsulated within CCMV, resulting in an estimated one in every 130 capsids containing the enzyme and allowing study of the enzyme at a single-molecule level. 425 Comparison of the activity of encapsulated and non-encapsulated enzyme showed different signatures due to the time necessary for the dihydrorhodamine 6G substrate to diffuse in and the fluorescent rhodamine 6G product to diffuse out of the capsid. Resultantly, product accumulation and delayed loss of fluorescence was observed with the spatially constrained HRP. Further investigation with the confinement of the enzyme Pseudozyma antartica lipase B (PalB) within CCMV utilized a heterodimeric coiled-coil linker to first attach PalB to CP subunits before assembly. 426 Through varying the ratio of CP with and without PalB during assembly, the average number of encapsulated enzymes could be controlled. Encapsulated PalB had a higher activity compared to non-encapsulated PalB, which was hypothesized to be due to a higher enzyme concentration when considering just the capsid alone. Additionally, there was no effect on the reaction velocity when varying the number of encapsulated enzymes between one and four PalB per capsid, which is likely due the presence of generally only one substrate molecule per capsid, making more than one enzyme unnecessary for substrate conversion.
 Tethered encapsulation was also explored using RNA aptamers. 427 The technique utilized co-expression of Qβ CP, Rev-tagged Peptidase E (PepE) or firefly luciferase, and a bifunctional mRNA containing an α-Rev aptamer and a Qβ genome packaging hairpin on its two ends for the encapsulation of the enzyme during expression and assembly. This strategy resulted in up to 18 enzymes encapsulated within the particle. The enzymes remained active after encapsulation, and the capsid was found to offer some protection against thermal degradation, protease digestion, as well as hydrophobic adsorption. A one-pot expressionassembly approach has also been utilized for enzyme tethering within P22, with initial studies investigating programmed encapsulation of alcohol dehydrogenase D (AdhD) 428 and homotetrameric β-glycosidase enzyme CelB 429 using plasmids harboring both genes for the P22 CP and for its scaffold protein (SP) fused to the enzyme of interest. SPs associate with the interior of the P22 capsid in such a way that the enzymes are consequently encapsulated during expression and assembly of the proteins in E. coli. AdhD encapsulated in P22 was less active due to enzyme crowding effects but overall had a similar catalytic efficiency and did not exhibit substrate inhibition, unlike free AdhD. 428 With encapsulation of CelB, which is only active in its tetrameric form, incorporation of multimeric enzymes in P22 was demonstrated. 429 Surprisingly, unlike AdhD encapsulated CelB did not result in loss in activity or change in substrate affinity. Additionally, embedding the encapsulated CelB in an acrylamide gel and dehydrating and rehydrating the gel resulted in over 60% retention in activity, which could be attributed to substrate diffusion limitations, therefore presenting the utility of P22 nanoreactors for enzyme immobilization applications.
 A consideration for the use of capsids as a nanoreactor is the influence of electrostatics on substrate diffusion into the carrier. 430 MS2 CPs were assembled around negatively charged alkaline phosphatase (PhoA-neg), and the effect of capsid mutation adding either negative or positive charges around its pores was explored. Not unexpectedly, while introduction of negative charge had an inhibitory effect, additional positive charge resulted in greater catalysis of the negatively charged phosphatase substrate. Therefore, engineering of nanoreactors can be used to control the flux and extent of reaction. Another benefit of nanoreactors, also seen above with PepE, is the bestowment of stabilization. As an additional example, encapsulation within P22 of phosphotriesterase, which has low heat tolerance and is prone to hydrolysis, yielded protection from proteases and desiccation as well as thermal stability with activity even at 60°C, making it a more practical option as an enzyme for combatting various harmful insecticides and nerve agents. 431 The strategy for sequestration of enzymes within P22 during expression is also valuable for the recovery of otherwise insoluble proteins. 432 Some recombinant proteins are trafficked to inclusion bodies during production in E. coli, making recovery difficult. α-galactosidase (GalA) is one such protein that was studied, and encapsulation within P22 was shown to allow for successful rescue of properly folded GalA. Encapsulation resulted in very highly active enzyme, which was hypothesized to be most likely due to more correctly folded and active enzymes when produced in this manner.
 There is a range of other applications to consider for nanoreactors, many of which have been demonstrated using P22 viral scaffolds. For example, it was determined that the immobilization of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inside P22 could be used for its stabilization and delivery to human cervix carcinoma cells with retention of substrate conversion activity, which could be further exploited for enzymatic prodrug therapies. 132 In addition, encapsulation of NADH oxidase, which predominantly reduces oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, was demonstrated as a method for bacterial growth inhibition by triggering oxidative damage in E. coli cultures. 433 Notably, a recent breakthrough in nanoreactor technology is its use for the catalysis of hydrogen production. 434 Sequestration of oxygentolerant nickel-iron (NiFe)-hydrogenase in P22 provided greater stability for the hydrogenase and resultantly, a greater than 100-fold increase in proton reduction activity over the free enzyme was observed. With the scalable production of encapsulated hydrogenase through simple fermentation, cheap and sustainable clean fuel production can be realized.
 Further development of viral nanoreactors also explored the introduction of multiple enzymes tethered to P22. 131 By the close proximity of enzymes involved in a cascade, the product of one enzyme can be efficiently taken as the input of the next. Assessment of enzyme cascade encapsulation was evaluated with the tetrameric CelB, the monomeric ATPdependent galactokinase (GALK), and the dimeric ADP-dependent glucokinase (GLUK), which processes lactose into galactose and glucose, phosphorylates galactose to form galactose-1-phosphate, and phosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, respectively (Figure 19 ). Using multienzyme GLUK-CelBSP and GALK-GLUK-CelB-SP fusions, coencapsulation of two-and three-enzyme cascades within P22 was achieved. When compared to a 1:1 mixture of individually encapsulated CelB-P22 and GLUK-P22 controls, GLUK-CelB-P22 showed greater enzymatic conversion under inhibitory conditions for CelB. GALK-GLUK-CelB-P22 additionally showed a greater than 2-fold faster turnover rate than GLUK-CelB-P22, suggesting all three proteins assembled property into their active forms and were successfully encapsulated. Therefore, enzyme assemblies are of import in facilitating the construction of complex metabolic systems.
 interesting area that has just recently been considered is the application of plant viruses in agriculture. Since their natural hosts for infection are plants, at first glance it appears counterintuitive to apply such nanoparticles for this particular application. However, the pioneering study utilized RCNMV for combatting parasitic root nematode infections and demonstrated that such particles have better mobility in the soil, therefore improving the bioavailability of the abamectin pesticide for nematode control. 112 Using ligand gating for infusion (see Section 3.3), the neutrally charged pesticide could be loaded within RCNMV. In such a manner, the abamectin cargo is protected against oxidation and can be released over time. Encapsulated and free abamectin showed similar efficacies in liquid nematode cultures, but when tested on infected tomato seedlings, the viral delivery of abamectin resulted in healthier root growth and reduced root galling compared to abamectin alone. These results have important implications for the agricultural industry, where parasitic nematodes have resulted in astronomical costs on the order of $118 billion worldwide due to crop damage, 435 and future considerations with noninfectious VLPs could further refine this strategy of using the naturally evolved mechanisms of such viruses for cargo delivery to plants.
 Plant-based pharmaceutical production-In Section 2.2, we discussed how GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Medicago Inc., and Mapp Biopharmaceutical adopted expression systems derived from viruses for the production of VLP vaccines and antibody cocktails. Plants, as used by Medicago Inc. and Mapp Biopharmaceutical, are not as well known for the expression of recombinant proteins as the more widely used E. coli and yeast expression systems, so we will focus on some examples of plant-based production systems in this section to illustrate some of their advantages. The utilization of plants as a production platform has undergone rapid growth, and cost-effective, highly scalable, and safe production of protein pharmaceuticals with post-translational modifications can now be achieved using plant viral vectors. 436, 437 Due to these advantages in cost and production, plant systems offer the potential for rapid pharmaceutical development, especially for more impoverished areas.
 One of the first examples of transfecting plants with viral vectors that demonstrated rapid production of a protein relevant to pharmaceutics utilized an expression vector based on TMV. 438 High level heterologous expression of biologically active α-trichosanthin, which can inhibit HIV replication in vitro, was achieved through insertion of the gene into a TMV plasmid. By controlling its transcription using a subgenomic promoter, regulation of the expression of the specific gene could be achieved. Further research of such N. benthamianabased expression systems found that suppression of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), the plant's adaptive immune system, resulted in enhanced efficiency and was possible through co-expression of the P19 protein of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV). 439 In parallel, the development of the magnICON ""deconstructed"" TMV vector system 440 has resulted in advancements in the production capacity without need for PTGS suppression. 441 The magnICON system involves engineering DNA modules for replication, the gene of interest, and recombination, with the advantage of being easily modifiable using Gateway technology, a universal system for cloning. The modules are then delivered to plants by Agrobacterium and result in transient gene expression and production of viral RNA replicons that can replicate autonomously. 440 Furthermore, through ""magnifection,"" or weak vacuum infiltration of the plants immersed in the Agrobacterium suspension, transfection at a large scale can be quickly achieved without the need of the CP gene or the wait for systemic plant movement. 442 A large variety of biologically relevant pharmaceutics have been produced using magnICON, including VLP vaccines, 443, 444 antibodies, 445, 446 plague antigens, 447 cytokines, 448 and growth hormones. 449 The TMV RNA-based overexpression (TRBO) vector is another replicon system that has been developed and has shown promise for high-level protein expression, with greater yields than demonstrated with the aforementioned P19-enhanced transient expression ( Figure  20) . 450 Essentially, the TRBO vector is a 35S promoter-driven TMV expression vector with the CP gene removed. The CP deletion resulted in a higher efficiency of recombinant protein expression, which was demonstrated for a range of proteins, including GFP, adenosine kinase, the 10 th domain from human fibronectin, and some proteinases. Another study also demonstrated the usefulness of the TRBO vector for production of R8, a chimeric allergen derived from dust mites that could be applied for asthma diagnosis or immunotherapy. 451 Similar expression systems have been derived from plasmids based on PVX and other potexviruses. Complete PVX constructs can be used for the expression of recombinant proteins alongside PVX CPs through insertion of an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for initiation of translation in the middle of an mRNA, between the two genes. 452 Similar constructs that instead have an intervening FMDV 2A cleavage sequence can be used to create proteins expressed as a fusion to the CP. 453 While larger inserts tend to result in genetic instability and loss of the gene of interest, 454 the combination of introducing a heterologous subgenomic promoter from bamboo mosaic virus and deleting a portion at the N-terminus of the CP was found to be a successful strategy to increase transgene expression stability. 455 Deconstructed vectors have also been used for PVX-based expression systems. For example, through replacement of the CP gene and the triple gene block (TGB) that encodes movement proteins, efficient production of the gene insert can be achieved. 456 Suppression of PTGS helped to improve yields, with transient co-expression of P19 from TBSV or HC-Pro from tobacco etch virus (TEV) resulting in a 44% and 83% increase in gene expression, respectively. 457 Amplicon-plus Targeting Technology utilizes this benefit of gene silencing suppression to enhance production. 458 This technology involves using a transgenic TEV-B tobacco line that expresses the suppressor gene that is then infected with a PVX amplicon containing the gene of interest. Successful production of a highly labile L1 vaccine protein from canine oral papillomavirus was achieved when this system was used for the expression of the recombinant protein fused to a chloroplast targeting peptide. Coupling of PVX and TMV viral vector systems has also been evaluated and was demonstrated to be a useful approach for resolving complications from competition between multiple replicons in the same cells. 446 With the noncompetitive viral systems, expression of assembled oligomeric proteins can be accomplished, such as for construction of full-length IgG with its heavy and light chains. 445, 446 Some other examples of potexvirus vectors include vectors based on plantago asiatica mosaic virus (PlAMV) 459 and foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV). 460 The recombinant PlAMV vector was found to have greater genetic stability and longer retention of the inserted gene compared to PVX, likely due to stronger RNA silencing suppression activity found from the first movement protein in its TGB. 459 On the other hand, the FoMV-based FECT vector series utilized deconstructed plasmids in which the CP and TGB were deleted and required co-expression of the P19 suppressor of PTGS. 460 Moving on to other systems, CPMV-based expression systems have also shown great versatility for the enhanced expression of a large range of proteins, including antibodies, 461 human gastric lipase, 462 and VLP vaccines (such as BTV VLPs discussed in Section 4.1.3). 230 CPMV is a bipartite virus with RNA-1 providing replication and protein processing capabilities and RNA-2 coding for movement and coat proteins. By altering the shorter RNA-2 through removal of the movement and coat proteins and appending the gene of interest, expression of foreign genes can be achieved through inoculation of plants with constructs of both RNA-1 and the modified RNA-2. 463, 464 Agroinfiltration of just the RNA-2 construct with the TBSV P19 suppressor of silencing was found to overcome the necessity for RNA-1, and additional elimination of the second start codon in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of RNA-2, located at position 161, resulted in hypertranslation of the downstream protein, likely due to AUG 161 being inhibitory for overall translation. 465 With this discovery, high protein expression could be achieved without restrictions on insert size and without the need for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
 The hypertranslatable CPMV or CPMV-HT system described above was packaged into pEAQ expression vectors for easy recombination, where the gene of interest can be inserted between the modified 5' UTR and the 3' UTR of RNA-2, and with P19 expressed from the same plasmid. 466 The pEAQ vectors have broad applications, but perhaps one of its greatest advantages is the production of VLPs for vaccines. Medicago Inc. uses CPMV-HT for its large-scale production of enveloped influenza H5 VLPs, with observed budding from the plasma membrane resulting in envelopment and similar structural characteristics to influenza viral particles. 467 eCPMV can also be produced using the pEAQ system, where the necessary proteins for CPMV formation, namely its VP60 CP precursor and a 24K proteinase, could either be expressed from the same vector or from two CPMV-HT vectors to form the mature eCPMV particle devoid of any nucleic acid encapsulated. 468 Since the pEAQ vector is nonreplicative, levels of expression of multiple proteins can be controlled through co-infiltration of appropriate concentrations of the expression vectors. In such a manner more complex VLPs such as BTV VLPs consisting of up to four different proteins can be assembled. 230 Our last examples of plant viral expression vectors come from geminiviruses, which are small ssDNA viruses with twinned capsid morphology. The in-plant activation (INPACT) expression platform is notable for its use of a split-gene cassette in stably transformed plants. 469, 470 The INPACT cassette is based on a deconstructed tobacco yellow dwarf virus (TYDV) genome and consists of two components: (1) the gene of interest split into two exons with flanking large intergenic regions (LIRs) and a small intergenic region (SIR) in between, and (2) Rep and RepA activator genes required for replication and activation of recombinant protein production that are inducible by ethanol. Binding of Rep to a site within the LIR initiates rolling circle replication of the replicon system. With ethanol induction, protein production is separate from plant growth, allowing high levels of protein expression that could be cytotoxic or inhibit plant development.
 Another method uses a single-vector DNA replicon system based on bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV) and is exemplified by the production of oligomeric monoclonal antibodies protective for EBOV. 471 The plasmid contains two tandemly linked replicons for the heavy and light chains and only requires the SIR, LIR, and Rep/RepA viral components. The system resulted in noncompeting replicon amplification and protein expression, with efficient assembly of the IgG tetramer. As a final example, pRIC is a similar BeYDV-derived autonomously replicating vector 472 that presented an advancement to a previous high expressing but non-replicating pTRAc cassette. 473 The pRIC replicon gene vector was created by the addition of the SIR, LIR, and Rep/RepA genes and resulted in gene amplification up to 2 orders of magnitude and up to 7-fold greater production of HPV-16 major CP L1 and HIV-1C p24 subunit vaccine antigens compared to pTRAc. 472 There are clearly many options for quick and high yielding recombinant protein production in plants. Although MagnICON has been used widely in the past, its utilization of multiple modules likely detracts from its efficiency, and the development of other systems using single constructs may lead to greater popularity. The main applications for plant-based production have been for antibody and vaccine production, but pharmaceutical proteins of all types can also be produced with the above techniques.
 The design and development of devices with nanoscale features open the door for novel and more efficient ways to capture, store, and transfer energy. Since viruses are self-assembled from coat proteins into nanoscale structures, and the protein-based building blocks also show an inherent propensity to self-assemble into higher-order hierarchical assemblies, 124, [474] [475] [476] [477] [478] [479] they provide an ideal building scaffold for the design of nanostructured materials. The versatility of hybrid virus-based materials in energy sciences and applications has already been recognized. Examples are highlighted in the following sections of the functionalization of virus-based materials to yield energy-relevant materials such as light harvesting systems, plasmonic metamaterials, and energy and data storage systems.
 hurdle to the production of mesoscale nanostructured materials is the availability of high-precision manufacturing technologies that facilitate large-scale assembly while also providing spatial control at the 1-100 nanometer level. 480 Top-down approaches, derived from technology implemented by the computer industry, have progressed to provide tighter control of feature dimensions with impeccable reproducibility. To program feature components, they rely on lithographic fabrication, such as photolithography, 481 microcontact printing (or soft lithography), 482, 483 block copolymer nanolithography, 484, 485 nanoimprint lithography, 486 and scanning-probe or dip-pen lithography. 487, 488 Although top-down approaches facilitate extraordinary reproducibility in the writing of nanoscale features at the centimeter size scale, the technology is highly specialized and feature sizes are still limited.
 On the other hand, bottom-up approaches seek to achieve directed and controlled assembly of individual components into hierarchical architectures, and they more closely mimic biological systems, cells, and organisms, which can orchestrate complex energy conversion functionalities. Developments in the art and science of self-assembly have made tremendous contributions to the 3D organization of composite materials, rendering high precision manufacturing of energy-relevant biomolecular and inorganic materials possible. For example, DNA-based ""programming"" exploits the sequence-specificity of base pairing to precisely position materials in 2D and 3D space. [489] [490] [491] [492] [493] [494] [495] [496] [497] [498] [499] Chemical programming of hierarchical structures has also been devised, as seen in the synthesis of branched dendrimer systems. [500] [501] [502] [503] [504] [505] Other methods include the use of synthetic block copolymers 506 or the application of orthogonal pairs of coiled-coil peptides 507, 508 to induce self-assembly of nanoparticles. It is clear that self-assembly holds great potential for the nanomanufacturing of mesoscale materials through simple solution-based bottom-up synthesis, and virus-based self-assembly is one such approach that presents several unique advantages.
 For example, high aspect ratio virus particles, such as the plant virus TMV and bacteriophage M13, form excellent biology-derived scaffolds for the templating and synthesis of inorganic matter to produce nanowires at the mesoscale. 282, [509] [510] [511] In the case of TMV, mineralization can be achieved both in its interior channel 119 and around its exterior surface, 282 leading to explicit control of the width of the wires. By coupling viral particles with mineralization techniques, semiconducting, superconducting, and insulating nanowires can be formed, resulting in hybrid materials with properties of interest to energy sciences and the electronic industry.
 High-order assemblies bridging the nano-to-mesoscale can also be achieved with selfassembly. For instance, TMV building blocks can be specifically directed to assemble endto-end (or head-to-tail) or side-to-side when exposed to appropriate bathing conditions. 512, 513 At acidic pH, TMV rods tend to align head-to-tail and form long wires due to hydrophobic interactions between the dipolar ends of the TMV rod. 514 The 1D TMV wires can be further stabilized and condensed to form bundles with the assistance of aniline through in situ polymerization of polyaniline. 478 By additionally incorporating DNA hybridization, progress has also been made toward greater control in the specific ordering of viral particles when assembled end-to-end. 515 To accomplish this, the ends of M13 phage were functionalized with different DNA oligonucleotides in such a manner that introduction of the appropriate hybridizing oligonucleotides led to the assembly of ordered phage trimers (Figure 21) . Although this work investigated controlling the sequence of phages labeled with different fluorescent dyes, in the future it can be further extended for the formation of heterofunctional multiphage structures with distinct moieties that impart more complex functionalities.
 The high aspect ratio structures formed by TMV and phages M13 and fd have also long been used to produce and study liquid crystalline arrangements, which may find applications in next-generation electronic displays. To yield liquid crystalline assemblies, in-solution mixing protocols have been developed to drive the alignment and spatial organization of the proteinaceous building blocks. A classical approach makes use of concentration gradients such that a nematic liquid crystalline phase is generated at a critical concentration. 516 The onset of ordering can be explained by the Onsager theory for isotropic-nematic phase transition, which states that there is competition between translational and orientational entropy, leading to higher densities favoring the nematic phase in order to confer greater translational entropy. 517, 518 Filamentous viruses are able to form the same mesophases exhibited by other rod-shaped liquid crystal materials: nematic, cholesteric, smectic A, and smectic C, and they can exist interchangeably. 477, 519 For example, M13 phage-based liquid crystals present a nematic phase at low concentrations. As the concentration increases, a cholesteric liquid crystalline phase is observed. Finally, at high concentrations, the system exhibits a smectic liquid crystalline phase. Furthermore, based on the anisotropic nature of the filamentous viruses, external stimuli such as electric and magnetic fields can be applied to tune the ordering, therefore allowing alignment of the whole sample. 13, 520, 521 Ordering can also be achieved at liquid/liquid and liquid/solid interfaces. For instance, when the oil/water interface between perfluorodecalin and water was explored, it was found that TMV rods aligned parallel to the interface at low concentrations but aligned normal to the interface at high concentrations, which could be attributed to a compromise between maximizing interfacial interactions and minimizing electrostatic repulsion between the rods. 475 Parallel alignment of TMV can also be achieved through assembly at interfaces between buffer and a lipid monolayer supported on a submerged hydrophobic substrate, with the inclusion of Ca 2+ ions helping to screen Coulomb repulsion between the particles. 522, 523 Another possibility for the formation of assemblies of high aspect ratio viruses is through mixtures with spheres; the increased free energy at the interface favors the assembly of uniform structures. 524, 525 This was observed in a study where isotropic, nematic, lamellar, and crystalline phases were obta ined through the modulation of the concentration of TMV, the concentration of BSA or PEG spheres, and the ionic strength.
 Addition of divalent metal cations has also been shown to induce the formation of ordered aggregates of TMV. Precipitates of TMV with nematic liquid crystal properties were formed with the addition of ions such as Cd 2+ , Zn 2+ , Pb2 + , Cu 2+ , and Ni 2+ , an effect that did not extend to the alkaline earth metals Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ . 526 Furthermore, highly ordered, optically birefringent films were formed when the aggregates were dried on a glass surface. It is hypothesized that TMV contains low-affinity metal binding sites that induce its crosslinking in the presence of the metal ions. While beneficial for liquid crystal applications, this behavior poses an important consideration when formation of well-dispersed biomineralized TMV is desired in the formation of hybrid materials. For example, achieving conditions for dense copper deposition without aggregation of the TMV templates is a challenge. 527 Nevertheless, exciting new properties may be possible as a result of particle assembly. Assembly of TMV in the presence of Ba 2+ is of particular interest, as instead of the liquid crystalline ordering found for other divalent metal ions studied, the TMV crystallized into a hexagonal superlattice that may have interesting electronic properties. 528 In addition to in-solution techniques, electrospinning, wet spinning, and dip coating have been applied to generate long-range ordered filamentous virus-based films. 333, 529 For example, varied chiral liquid crystalline M13 phage films were obtained with the use of dip coating methods. 333 By carefully adjusting phage concentration, pulling speed, bathing conditions, M13 surface chemistry, and surface chemistry of the solid support, supramolecular M13 films with nematic orthogonal twists, cholesteric helical ribbons, or smectic helicolidal nanofilaments could be produced. These M13 arrays exhibited unique optical and photonic properties such that the films showed iridescence when illuminated, which has potential applications as reflectors or displays. Another potential area of application lies in colorimetric sensing. For example, matrices formed using dip coating of M13 displaying binding peptides for the explosive TNT showed significant enough structure changes in the presence of TNT vapors that levels down 300 ppb could be selectively distinguished (Figure 22) . 395 Another area of interest is the use of viral building blocks for the patterning of surfaces, which can be accomplished using a variety of strategies, including conjugation chemistries 530, 531 and electrostatic interactions. 479, [532] [533] [534] [535] [536] The patterning of virus-based nanobuilding blocks has also been demonstrated using photolithographic and microcontact printing strategies, where a hard elastomeric pattern is ""inked"" with virions and stamped onto a functionalized surface primed to interact with the virus-based nanoparticles. 537 Toward free-standing films, we have recently demonstrated the development of detachable mesoporous films, using a combination of nanosphere lithography and electrodeposition to form nanopatterned, conducting virus-polymer arrays (Figure 23) . 538 To accomplish this, a hexagonally close-packed array of polystyrene (PS) latex microspheres was created using colloidal or nanosphere lithography, yielding a mesoporous architecture. A conducting poly(pyrrole-co-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid) film was then electrochemically polymerized in the interstitial voids between the PS beads by cyclic voltammetry. Following PS template removal, CPMV particles were deposited atop the conducting polymer film through electrostatic adsorption and hydrogen bonding. The resultant Janus polymer-virus film was found to be robust and stable, allowing it to be electrochemically delaminated from the substrate.
 Other methods for VNP immobilization onto a surface have utilized DNA hybridization, a powerful technique proven for effective guided assembly of materials in 3D space. [489] [490] [491] [492] [493] [494] [495] [496] [497] [498] [499] DNA hybridization facilitates controlled and reversible assembly through adjustment of sequence specificity, temperature, or chemical cues (e.g. access of free nucleotides). The TMV building block is one example where nucleic acid hybridization was applied for the programming of materials. 539, 540 Here, TMV underwent a mild disassembly protocol to expose the 5' end of its genome, which could then be used as a code to guide the assembly of vertical TMV arrays, either directly with the corresponding complementary oligonucleotides displayed on the surface, 539 or through an intervening DNA linker with sequences specific for both the TMV and the surface 540 . As an alternative nucleic acid-based method, RNA templates containing the TMV OAS can be patterned onto surfaces, giving a cue for the in situ formation of TMV arrays from the surface up when purified TMV coat proteins are added. 541, 542 Icosahedrons also make excellent building blocks for self-programmed assembly of crystalline arrays and lattices. Two-dimensional virus arrays of CPMV have been formed through a drop-and-dry method on a mica substrate, with packing symmetry controlled by modulating the PEG surfactant concentration. 543 The organization of the rhombic and hexagonal closed packed structures formed can be attributed to both steric requirements as well as the charge distribution around the capsid surface. Another approach utilizes interfacial adsorption of viral particles under a cationic lipid monolayer that is formed at the surface of an aqueous solution. 544, 545 Based on studies with CPMV and TYMV, varying 2D array architectures such as rectangular, hexagonal, and rhombic lattices were achieved using this method.
 For 3D crystals, a standard technique applied is depletion condensation, in which PEG is a common condensing agent used for the induction of virus crystallization in bulk. 546 Toward the programming of binary materials and photonic crystals, the organization of compact structures of Qβ phage and gold nanoparticles through DNA interconnectors was reported, and the binary lattice was shown to form a NaTl lattice structure that contained interpenetrating organic and inorganic diamond lattices. 547 Assembly of viruses can also be mediated by electrostatic self-assembly, 548 and organization of particles into crystalline lattices using this method has been demonstrated through the introduction of dendrons and dendrimers. [549] [550] [551] More recently, binary AB nanoparticle superlattices were achieved using icosahedral CCMV and either gold nanoparticles 552 or avidin 553 . The patchy, but symmetrical, charge distribution on the virus capsid surface enables the formation of binary cubic structures. The authors have also recently extended these concepts to the non-viral protein cage ferritin, yielding photoactive biohybrid crystals with phthalocyanine dyes. 554 More specifically, face-centered cubic crystals up to 100 microns in size were obtained in which the phthalocyanines maintained their native properties, suggesting that such materials could find applications in photodynamic therapy, water treatment, diagnostic arrays, and as an oxidant in organic synthesis.
 The programmability of the viral scaffold, combined with its propensity to self-assemble into 3D hierarchical architectures, has led to its application toward devices such as battery electrodes, digital memory devices, and energy storage devices. As discussed and illustrated in earlier sections, viruses offer a framework for ligand and peptide display. As a result, they can facilitate the precise deposition of inorganic and organic materials such as metals, 67, 533, [555] [556] [557] metal oxides, 511 semiconductors, 558 graphene, 559 and carbon nanotubes, 560 all of which are energy-relevant materials.
 To achieve digital memory, virus hybrids can be created such that they exhibit conductance switching behavior. 561, 562 One method to fabricate such a device involved decorating TMV with Pt nanoparticles and using them to form a composite layer in a PVA matrix sandwiched between two electrodes. 561 As a result of charge trapping in the nanoparticles, the device exhibited bistable low conductance OFF and high conductance ON states, which were observed with the application of a reverse bias below −2.4 V or a forward bias above 3 V, respectively (Figure 24) . In a similar manner, CPMV decorated with semiconducting quantum dots also demonstrated bistable ON/OFF electrical behavior. 562 Additionally, for both systems, it was shown that process was reversible and could undergo repeated cycles of reading and writing. Although the maximum limit was found to be around 400 cycles, suggesting the need for further refinement, these investigations have established the use of biomaterial hybrid systems for memory storage and motivate the exploration of future possibilities.
 Some early work with scaffolds formed by CPMV investigated the positioning of redoxactive species, such as ferrocene and viologen, on the viral template. 563, 564 The multivalent redox-active nanoparticles exhibited simultaneous multielectron transfer, indicating that the multiple redox centers are independent and behave as essentially non-interacting redox units. Such materials may be envisioned as multielectron reservoirs and as nanoscale electron transfer mediators in redox catalysis or amperometric biosensors.
 Another electrical application for viruses involves their utilization as battery electrodes. Research has been performed for the creation of both cathodes and anodes based on M13 as well as TMV templates. 510, 556, 557, [565] [566] [567] [568] Using self-assembly of the viruses, fabrication of high performing small battery electrodes was made possible. Early studies utilized M13 to grow cobalt oxide nanowires that served as the active anode material, and they demonstrated that virus network formation is a versatile method that could be applied for the formation of electrodes on both rigid and flexible substrates with full electrochemical functionality and greater capacity. 510, 565 Additional hybridization of the nanowires with Ni nanoparticles was found to enhance efficiency and cycle life. 568 When M13 was instead used for biotemplating of manganese oxide to serve as a cathode for lithium-oxygen batteries, improved capacity of porous networks formed by the virus was also observed. 566 On the other hand, TMV electrode development utilized its ability to assemble vertically on a substrate to form ""nanoforests"" with high surface area and room to accommodate for volume expansion. 556, 557 Engineering of the TMV anode involved Sn nanoparticle deposition on Ni-coated TMV, which was then further coated with carbon. In such a way, Sn aggregation that usually occurs when it expands during performance in sodium ion batteries was suppressed. 556 Alternatively, the TMV-based cathode was designed for integrated lithium ion batteries, and it was formed by coating TMV-templated Ni nanorods with Ti, LiFePO 4 , then carbon. 557 Aside from excellent electrochemical performance, both TMV electrodes exhibited high mechanical and electronic integrity.
 An additional M13-templated electrode example that is of note is one that utilized iridium oxide as the anodic material. 511 IrO 2 is exciting because it is an electrochromic material, which experiences color change through electrical potential application, a useful property for paper-like display devices. By chemically attaching gold nanoparticles to M13 before mineralization of IrO 2 , IrO 2 -Au hybrid nanowires were formed to enhance electron mobility. Porous electrodes made of these nanowires exhibited remarkable switching times of 35 ms for oxidation/coloration and 25 ms for reduction/bleaching, which is promising for applications requiring fast electrochromics.
 Further energy materials that can be engineered with viral scaffolds for energy storage and generation devices include graphene sheet conducting frameworks and Au-Pt core-shell catalytic nanowires. 559, 569 In the first case, M13 was used to stabilize graphene sheets in aqueous media stabilized to prevent the spontaneous aggregation between individual graphene sheets. 559 M13 also served as a viral template to facilitated the nucleation of bismuth oxyfluoride, a conversion reaction cathode material, to form graphene/bismuth oxyfluoride nanocomposites that could be used as a conducting framework for energy storage with improved electron transfer kinetics. In the case of the catalytic nanowires mentioned above, M13 was used as a template for mineralization of Au followed by Pt, a design with fuel cell applications. 569 With the Au core as a co-catalyst to oxidize and remove carbon monoxide, the Pt nanowires could be used to oxidize ethanol with less vulnerability to any such carbonaceous species that are formed. This strategy demonstrated excellent catalytic activity, and it additionally has advantages of simple scale-up synthesis, greater durability of the Pt catalyst, and lower cost due to the presence of M13 reducing dead volume of Au in the core.
 As a final example of the energy generation potential of phages, liquid crystals formed from M13 phage have been shown to exhibit piezoelectric properties. 570 Glutamic acid residues were introduced at the N-terminus of the pVIII coat proteins in order to create a greater net dipole moment directed from the N-terminus to the positively charged C-terminus, which resulted in an enhancement in the effective piezoelectric coefficient of the phage films. Selfassembled phage monolayers with nematic structure and phage multilayers with smectic structure all demonstrated piezoelectric behavior, with the response increasing in accordance to increasing film thickness until saturation occurred at around a thickness of 100 nm. The investigation further demonstrated easily fabrication of multilayer phage films through spontaneous ordering after dropcasting, and the energy output from mechanical pressure of the film was sufficient to turn on a liquid crystal display. Overall, this phage-based technology presents an opportunity for environmentally friendly energy generation.
 Light harvesting systems, such as found in the photosynthesis machinery of plants, enable the conversion of light into energy. 571 Chromophores transport energy using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), whereby electrons are excited upon photon absorption by one chromophore then transfer their energy to another chromophore as they undergo relaxation through further photon emission. The excitation energy gets transferred in a cascade from donors to acceptors when the energy levels of absorption and emission match. The photosynthesis system of plants contains precisely spaced arrays of chromophores that facilitate light harvesting and conversion into energy and is one o f nature's most sophisticated energy conversion complexes. 571 Synthetic light harvesting systems are of great interest in basic energy science and technology development for implementation in solar panels and other photovoltaic devices. Like photosynthetic machinery, viral capsids provide a means to precisely position chromophores with spatial control at the sub-nanometer level. Recognizing this engineering design space, a few examples have been published using the self-assembling TMV scaffold. 68, 572, 573 In brief, TMV coat proteins were covalently labeled with either a donor or an acceptor from a FRET pair and then assembled into disk or rod structures at a controlled ratio of donors to acceptors. Through assembly, the chromophores could be positioned in close proximity at tunable distances in such a way to achieve the most efficient FRET. Similarly, M13 displaying zinc porphyrins has also shown promise as a light harvesting antenna, and FRET was observed in which the porphyrin served as both a donor and an acceptor for exciton migration along the virus. 574 A very recent study has revealed groundbreaking work that further enhances the efficiency of energy transport in light harvesting devices. 575 For the first time, experimental evidence was found that demonstrated a super-Förster regime where quantum coherence and classical incoherent mechanisms interact to enhance exciton transfer efficiency compared to what can be found with classical FRET. Genetic engineering of M13 was utilized to regulate the distances between chromophore binding sites to be either around 33 Å for the ""Classical Förster"" clone or 10 Å for the ""Super-Förster"" clone, a distance short enough for increased coupling strength but not too short to experience complete quenching. Fluorescence measurements from the virions modified with a range of donor-to-acceptor ratios of chromophores demonstrated the superior behavior of the Super-Förster clone (Figure 25) . Additionally, there was a 68% enhancement in exciton diffusion length, an exciting outcome demonstrating enhanced exciton transport that has previously only been theorized. 576 As another part of the light harvesting process, filamentous viruses have also been employed for electron harvesting as nanowire-based photoanodes due to their ability to form porous networks with high surface area. Previous work has investigated the implementation of M13 in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). 560, [577] [578] [579] The design of DSSCs involves the presence of a dye or photosensitizer for light absorption that, when excited, transfers the energy into the conduction band of a TiO 2 photoanode, where it then diffuses to a current collector such as fluorine-doped tin oxide. By using M13 as a sacrificial template for photoanode formation, it was shown that a highly interconnected porous TiO 2 structure could be achieved for greater charge transport efficiency. Strategies to create a porous TiO 2 network included using electrostatic interactions for complexation of TiO 2 nanoparticles and M13 viruses, 577 layer-by-layer phage deposition before TiO 2 nucleation, 578 and crosslinking of the phages by glutaraldehyde to form a hydrogen before TiO 2 nucleation. 579 After removal of the sacrificial viral scaffold, the photoanode was found to possess improved electron diffusio n properties. With additional incorporation of gold nanoparticles, the dye molecules were found to also experience greater light absorption through localized surface plasmon resonance, therefore further improving light harvesting. 579 As another step toward improvement of DSSCs and other photovoltaics, stabilization of SWNTs by M13 through non-covalent binding before biomineralization of TiO 2 was used for successful incorporation of the SWNTs in the photoanode. 560 Due to the high electron mobility of the SWNTs, a high power conversion of 10.6% was observed with this strategy.
 Another example of M13-based photovoltaic cells involves the mineralization of perovskite nanocrystals, which have unique catalytic, electric, and magnetic properties. 558 In particular, M13 was used as a template for strontium titanate (STO) and bismuth ferrite (BFO) mineralization. The study presented the first report of the photovoltaic properties of BFO nanoparticles, which showed effective absorption of visible light but a solar power conversion efficiency of only 0.17%. On the other hand, the STO nanowires exhibited photocatalytic water reduction properties, and they could be used for the efficient hydrogen production under both UV and visible light. Additional research in this area investigated the improving the performance of STO nanowires under visible light. 580 Whereas dyesensitization was required in the previous study, 558 a new fabrication method was developed that utilized ammonia gas treatment to tune the optical absorption of the STO nanowires, which was successful for the manufacture of visible-light active photocatalysts.
 Light conversion has also been explored with TMV. 555 In the study, TMV was arranged vertically on a gold-coated indium tin oxide (ITO) surface, and the particles were then coated with nickel, ITO, followed by CuO; the ITO served as a current collector, while the CuO served as a photocathode. At a high enough TMV density, the film was found to form an antireflective surface due to its high surface area and surface roughness, which is beneficial for greater photoelectrochemical cell efficiency. Various CuO thicknesses were investigated, and a thickness of 520 nm was found to produce one of the highest photocurrent densities reported for CuO systems its size. Overall, the properties of this virus-templated surface bring much promise for future photoelectrochemical applications, such as catalytic water conversion.
 nanostructures have already led to breakthroughs in optics and nanophotonics, 581-584 as well as in biotechnology and biomedicine. 585, 586 For nanometer-sized noble metal particles, the de Broglie wavelength of the valence electrons is of the same order of magnitude as the size of the particle, and as a result quantum size effects may be observed. The characteristic plasmon resonance bands that lead to extraordinary metal enhancement effects arise due to the oscillation of the valence electrons at a collective oscillation frequency. 586, 587 Knowing this, nanostructures can be designed and organized such that their plasmonic bands are finely tuned. For applications in the body, a plasmonic range in the NIR imaging window where light can penetrate several centimeters into the tissue is desirable. The substantial absorption and scattering properties of plasmonic nanostructures can then be used as contrast agents for optical imaging, such as optical coherence tomography 588, 589 and photoacoustic imaging. 590 As a demonstration of a potential application of plasmonics, sensing using viral plasmonics has been achieved by using M13 phage loaded with gold nanocubes for SERS. 591 Alternatively, the plasmonic nanostructures also have applications in a therapeutic context due to the transformation of the absorbed light into heat, 592, 593 which could be applied for the thermal ablation of tumors or the controlled release of drugs. 594, 595 Use as ""theranostic"" reagents, where diagnostic imaging and therapeutic functions are merged, presents another option. 596, 597 Beyond healthcare, it should be noted that plasmonics can also be applied to many disciplines, including nonlinear plasmonics, electronic transport, local heating, biosensors, quantum optics, and metamaterials. 598 Virus-based plasmonic metamaterial synthesis was first demonstrated with BMV shells assembled around gold nanoparticle cores, where 3D crystals formed by the particles exhibited an optical transmission spectrum indicative of multipolar plasmonic coupling between adjacent gold cores. 124 More recently, MS2 phages were functionalized with internal gold nanoparticles and external fluorophores, with the intervening distance controlled using oligonucleotide hairpins (Figure 26) . 174 Enhancements in fluorescence intensity and corresponding decreases in lifetime were observed, and the results correlated well with expectations of the effect of the separation between the plasmon and gain materials. [599] [600] [601] In the reverse configuration (internal fluorophores and gold nanoparticle antennas), fluorescence enhancement was also observed, and it was found to be a function of nanoparticle size and the separation between the plasmon and gain material. 602 Some interesting electromagnetic effects can only be generated through well-structured ordering of plasmonic materials, a property that viruses can provide. A recent example exploring this potential involved the precise placement of plasmonic gold nanoparticles with defined spacing and symmetry using cysteine-functionalized CPMV. 281 The CPMV was engineered to allow gold to be placed at the 12 vertices around the capsid. The resultant plasmonic nanocluster demonstrated resonances at visible wavelengths due to interactions of neighboring gold nanoparticles, and finite-element simulations suggest the structure is likely to give rise to a 10-fold enhancement of the local electromagnetic field through near-field coupling.
 Overall, viruses have been exploited in the development of a dizzying array of applications that fall under the broad scope of medicine, biotechnology, and energy. While some areas in medicine, such as vaccines and gene delivery, have been around for a while, the application of viruses in other areas, such as drug delivery and tissue engineering, have only recently been conceptualized and developed. For many diseases, there is still much to tackle to improve the effectiveness of their diagnosis and treatment. One challenge of great interest for the transition of new virus-based nanomaterials into the clinic will be to attain more exquisite control over the ability to regulate the immune response and clearance behavior for specific applications. The immunogenicity of the proteinaceous coat of viral particles can be advantageous for immunotherapy but is undesirable when the particles are used as nanocarriers for imaging and drug delivery. It has been shown that the elimination of particles by antibodies can tuned with PEGylation, and alternative coatings such as serum albumin can further reduce an immune response. By conferring stealth properties, repeat administration of virus-based nanomaterials for applications in diagnostics and therapeutics will become achievable.
 In biotechnology, there have been many advances in the field of virus-based devices for sensing, diagnostics, catalysis, agriculture, and pharmaceutical production. To highlight some achievements, phage display has become a familiar technique, Armored RNA as a molecular diagnostic control is commercially available, and scaled-up manufacture of pharmaceutics in plants has been shown to be a cheap and effective alternative. Exciting developments just underway include the efficient catalysis of hydrogen for clean fuel production and the use of plant viruses for combatting diseases in plants. It will not be long before the widespread adoption of newer technology such as these follows.
 Finally, it should be abundantly clear that viruses present a great opportunity in the manufacture of energy-relevant materials. Along with their ability to self-assemble into ordered arrays, viruses offer the possibility for precise positioning at the nanoscale, a distinct advantage that can reveal novel material properties such as enhancements in plasmonic behavior. The recent breakthrough in enhancing light harvesting efficiency exemplifies the advantage of the well-ordered virus scaffold. Deeper understanding of virus structure and assembly, in combination with new approaches in synthetic virology, will yield ever more complex formulations that will enable new functions. It remains exciting at the viruschemistry interface! 
 Simplified illustrations show common methods for interior and exterior virus modification.
 To alter the composition of the protein capsid itself, genetic engineering can be used. With available exposed residues, bioconjugate chemistries can be performed. Through pores in the structure, small cargo can be infused into the capsid and then retained by reducing the pore size or electrostatic interactions. Interactions of metal precursors with the capsid can be used to selectively direct mineralization on the interior or exterior surface. Taking advantage of self-assembly of the viral scaffold, cargo introduced during assembly can be encapsulated.

This approach characterized the threat posed by SHC014-CoV spike in primary human airway cells, in vivo, as well as the efficacy of available immune therapeutics. Together, the strategy translates metagenomics data to help predict and prepare for future emergent viruses. SHC014 and WIV1 sequences represent the closest relatives to the epidemic SARS-CoV strains ( Fig. These changes, coupled with failure of pseudotyping ( Supplementary Fig. To test the ability of SHC014 spike to mediate infection of the human airway, we examined 2B4 Calu-3 cells, a human epithelial airway cell line 8 , and found robust SHC014-MA15 replication comparable to SARS-CoV Urbani (Fig. We next evaluated in vivo infection of 10-week old BALB/c mice with 10 4 plaque-forming units (PFU) of either SARS-MA15 or SHC014-MA15 ( Fig. In contrast, neutralization varied for SHC014-MA15. For all three antibodies, differences between SARS and SHC014 spikes corresponded to direct or adjacent residue changes found in escape mutants (fm6 -N479R; 230.15 -L443V; 227.14-K390). Together, the results demonstrate that despite the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV, these reagents may only have marginal efficacy against emergent SARS-like CoV strains like SHC014. Together, these results confirm DIV vaccine failure and illustrated augmented disease for the aged vaccinated group. In contrast to DIV, SHC014-MA15 challenge as a vaccine showed promise, but with important caveats. 6b , 1/200) implying diminished protection over time. However, phylogenetic analysis suggested that early human SARS strains appear more closely related to bat than civet strains 16 . While not invalidating the other emergence routes, the current study argues for a third paradigm in which circulating bat CoV pools maintain ""poised"" spike proteins capable of infecting humans without mutation or adaptation (Fig. To date, genomics screens of animal populations have primarily been used to identify novel viruses in outbreak settings 19 . The approach in this manuscript extends these datasets to examine questions of emergence and therapeutic efficacy. In addition, pathogenesis in mice indicates a capacity to cause disease in mammalian models without RBD adaptation. However, further testing in non-human primates is required to translate these finding into pathogenic potential in humans. Importantly, the failure of available therapeutics defines a critical need for further study and treatment development. With this knowledge, surveillance programs, diagnostic reagents, and effective treatments can be produced to protect from emergence of group 2b specific CoVs like SHC014 as well as other CoV branches that maintain similar heterogeneous pools. In developing policies moving forward, it is important to consider the value of the data generated by these studies and if they warrant further study or the inherent risks involved. Wild-type SARS-CoV (Urbani), mouse adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) and chimeric SARS-like CoVs were cultured on Vero E6 cells, grown in DMEM (Gibco, CA) and 5% Fetal Clone Serum (Hyclone, South Logan, UT) along with anti/anti (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA).

42,42,57ff95fe050588d74819f610f12750112c333cba,,An allosteric inhibitor of substrate recognition by the SCF Cdc4 ubiquitin ligase HHS Public Access Author manuscript,"The SCF ubiquitin ligases target proteins for degradation by recruitment factors called F-box proteins 1, 2 . We identified a bi-planar dicarboxylic acid compound, called SCF-I2, as an inhibitor of substrate phosphodegron recognition by the yeast F-box protein Cdc4. SCF-I2 inhibits the binding and ubiquitination of full length phosphorylated substrates by SCF Cdc4 . A crystal costructure reveals that SCF-I2 inserts between the β-strands of blades 5 and 6 of the WD40 propeller domain of Cdc4 at a site that is 25 Å remote from the substrate binding site. Long-range transmission of SCF-I2 interactions distorts the substrate binding pocket and impedes recognition of key determinants in the Cdc4 phosphodegron. Mutation of the SCF-I2 binding site abrogates its inhibitory effect and explains specificity in the allosteric inhibition mechanism. Mammalian WD40 domain proteins may exhibit similar allosteric responsiveness and hence represent an extensive new class of druggable target.
 The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) mediates the intracellular degradation of many proteins through a cascade of enzyme activities, termed E1, E2 and E3, which serially activate and then transfer ubiquitin to substrate proteins 3 . E3 enzymes, also referred to as ubiquitin ligases, specifically recognize discrete sequence motifs in substrates termed degrons. The human genome encodes at least 600 E3 enzymes, each of which has the potential to recognize multiple substrates 4 . The largest class of E3 enzymes, the cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), were discovered through identification of the multi-subunit Skp1-Cdc53/Cullin-F-box protein (SCF) complexes 1, 2 . A large family of F-box proteins recruit substrates to the core SCF complex via protein interaction domains, typically leucine rich repeats (LRRs) or WD40 repeats, often in a phosphorylation dependent manner 1, 2, 5-7 . The SCF enzymes likely target hundreds of different substrates 4, 8-10 and thus hold untapped potential for drug discovery 4 .","The WD40 repeat is an ancient conserved motif that functions in many different cellular processes 11, 12 . Tandem arrays of five to eight WD40 repeats form a circularly permuted βpropeller domain structure 13 . In yeast, recognition of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor Sic1 by the WD40 domain of the F-box protein Cdc4 depends on phosphorylation of multiple Cdc4 phospho-degron (CPD) motifs in Sic1 6, 14 . SCF Cdc4 also targets other substrates including Far1, Cdc6 and Gcn4 1 . Human Cdc4, also known as Fbw7, recruits a number of important regulatory factors for ubiquitination including cyclin E, Myc, Jun, Notch, SREBP and presenilin 9 . Cdc4 is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor that is mutated in many cancer types 9, 15 , and also likely influences stem cell renewal by virtue of its effects on Myc and other factors 16 . Given the central role of Cdc4/Fbw7 in growth and division, we sought to identify small molecules that inhibit substrate recognition by Cdc4.
 We adapted a previously established fluorescence polarization (FP) assay to monitor the displacement of a fluorescein-labeled CPD peptide (K d ≈ 0.2 μM) from yeast Cdc4 ( Supplementary Fig. 1a) 14 . The FP assay achieved a Z-factor of 0.8, based on negative (DMSO solvent only) and positive (unlabelled CPD peptide) controls. A screen against a 50,000 compound library enriched for drug-like molecules 17 yielded 44 hits that inhibited the CPD-Cdc4 interaction by at least 50% (Fig. 1a) . Two of these compounds, denoted SCF-I2 and SCF-I6, strongly inhibited the interaction of full length phospho-Sic1 with Cdc4 and prevented Sic1 ubiquitination by SCF Cdc4 (Fig. 1b) . We pursued only SCF-I2 because SCF-I6 appeared to cause non-specific loss of Skp1-Cdc4 complex from the capture resin ( Fig  1b) . SCF-I2 corresponds to 1-(2-carboxynaphth-1yl)-2-naphthoic acid, which is a derivative of 1,1′-binapthyl-2,2′diol, also known as BINOL, a bi-planar axially chiral atropisomer that is widely used as a scaffold in chiral synthesis 18 . The two hydroxyl groups of BINOL are substituted by carboxylic acid groups in SCF-I2 (Fig. 1c) . The form of 1-(2carboxynaphth-1-yl)-2-naphthoic acid) used in our all of our assays was an undefined racemic mixture of the R-and S-enantiomers, which are non-interconvertable at even high temperature 18 . SCF-I2 was 10-fold less potent than unlabeled CPD peptide in the FP assay, with an IC 50 = 6.2 μM versus 0.5 μM, respectively (Fig. 1c) . SCF-I2 inhibited binding and/or ubiquitination of both full length Sic1 and Far1 with an IC 50 of ~60 μM ( Supplementary Fig. 1b,c) ; the weaker apparent affinity of SCF-I2 in these assays may reflect differences in the interaction of peptides and full length substrates with Cdc4. SCF-I2 did not affect the activity of the closely related E3 enzyme SCF Met30 , which recruits its substrate Met4 via the WD40 domain of the F-box protein Met30 ( Supplementary Fig 1d) 19 .
 We determined the crystal structure of SCF-I2 bound to a Skp1-Cdc4 complex 20 to 2.6 Å resolution (see Supplementary Table 1 for data collection and refinement statistics). Unbiased difference electron density maps revealed that SCF-I2 binds to the WD40 repeat domain of Cdc4 at a site that is 25 Å distant from the CPD binding pocket (Fig. 2a) . The eight WD40 repeat motifs of Cdc4 form a canonical propeller structure in which each propeller blade consists of four anti-parallel β-strands and intervening loop regions ( Supplementary Fig. 2) 20 . SCF-I2 embeds in a deep pocket on the lateral surface of the βpropeller between blades 5 and 6 ( Fig. 2a,b; Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Cdc4 engages only one of two enantiomers of SCF-I2, the (R)-(+) equivalent of BINOL. The top napthalene ring system of SCF-I2 inserts deeply between blades 5 and 6 forming extensive hydrophobic contacts with Leu628, Ile594, Leu634, Trp657, and Ala649 (Fig. 2b ). In addition, the carboxyl group of the top ring system hydrogen bonds to the NH group of the Trp657 side chain and forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Arg664. The bottom napthalene ring system is more solvent exposed and forms a stabilizing co-planar stacking interaction with the side chain of Arg664 and van der Waals interactions with the side chains of Ser667 and Arg655. The carboxyl group of the bottom ring system also forms ionic interactions with the side chains of Arg655 and His631.
 In the apo-Skp1-Cdc4 structure, there is no obvious pre-existing pocket that might anticipate the binding mode of SCF-I2 (Fig. 2c) . Rather, the SCF-I2 binding pocket is induced by separation of blades 5 and 6 and a drastic shift of the β21-β22 linker that connects the two blades (Fig. 2d) . The reorientation of the β21-β22 linker entails a 5 Å shift of the main chain and a massive 13 Å shift of the side chain of His631 from a buried to solvent-exposed position (Fig. 2d,e) . These large conformational alterations create an interblade void that is filled by the rearrangement of residues proximal to the CPD binding pocket (Fig. 2d,e) . The void is filled in part by a swap of side chain positions between Val635, which is normally buried and adjacent to His631, and the normally solvent-exposed Leu634 side chain; as a consequence of this rearrangement, the side chains of Val635 and Leu634 traverse 6 and 8 Å, respectively. The position vacated by Leu634 in turn is filled by rotation of the side chain of Tyr574. Critically, both Tyr574 and Leu634 comprise part of the highly conserved CPD binding infrastructure. In the CPD peptide-Skp1-Cdc4 complex 20 , Tyr574 and Leu634 line the hydrophobic P-2 binding pocket within the central pore ( Fig. 2e ) and thereby dictate the preference for hydrophobic residues at the P-2 position of the CPD consensus motif 14, 20 . The P-2 pocket is thus severely distorted by the reoriented side chains of Tyr574 and Leu634 in the SCF-I2 bound structure. In addition, the hydroxyl group of Tyr574 participates in stabilizing H-bond interactions with the side chain of Arg572, one of the four invariant essential Arg residues found in all Cdc4 orthologs 20 . Arg572 stabilizes the orientation of Tyr548, which in turn directly hydrogen bonds to the CPD phosphate group in the P0 position. Thus, SCF-I2 critically compromises the main binding pockets for the P-2 and P0 positions of the CPD consensus sequence 14, 20 . As predicted by this structural model, the effects of SCF-I2 are mimicked by a Tyr574Ala mutation, which results in a 20-fold reduction in affinity of Cdc4 for the CPD peptide (Fig.  2f) .
 We explored the determinants of the SCF-I2-Cdc4 interface. The two carboxylic acid groups of SCF-I2 exhibit marked charge complementarity with the guanidinium side chains of Arg655 and Arg664. Mutation of each Arg residue individually to Ala attenuated the inhibition of Cdc4 by SCF-I2 by at least 50-fold (Fig. 2g) . Alleles bearing either mutation fully complemented Cdc4 function in vivo, indicating that this region of Cdc4 does not normally play a critical role in substrate recognition or SCF catalytic activity ( Supplementary Fig. 3a) . To investigate the structural features of SCF-I2 required for Cdc4 inhibition, we tested a panel of available BINOL analogs for activity in the FP assay ( Supplementary Fig. 3b,c) . This series demonstrated the importance of the napthalene ring systems that participate in numerous hydrophobic interactions and the carboxylate groups that form electrostatic interactions with the two Arg residues on Cdc4. These mutational and structure-activity results validate the binding mode for SCF-I2 observed in the crystal structure.
 We next assessed the activity SCF-I2 towards human Fbw7. The key Cdc4 residues Arg655 and Arg664 are replaced in Fbw7 by Lys and Cys respectively, suggesting that Fbw7 might be resistant to inhibition by SCF-I2. This proved to be the case as SCF-I2 inhibited the CPD-Fbw7 interaction only at high concentrations (Fig. 3a) . The residual inhibitory activity of SCF-I2 towards Fbw7 might be due to the conservative Arg-to-Lys substitution and the conservation of most other residues that form the induced SCF-I2 binding pocket (Fig 3b;  Supplementary Fig. 2) . Alignment of all human WD40 domains revealed that, aside from the two surface Arg residues, the pattern of SCF-I2 contact residues is often conserved (Supplementary Fig. 4) . We are currently exploring whether the BINOL scaffold can be modified to more potently interact with Fbw7 and other human WD40 domain proteins.
 The β subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, which transduce signals from a host of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), are the most thoroughly studied WD40 domain proteins 21 . Notably, the interaction of the regulatory protein phosducin with the G T β subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein transducin also causes significant structural rearrangements between adjacent WD propeller blades 22 . These rearrangements induce a binding pocket for the C-terminal farnesyl moiety of the partner G T γ subunit, which may serve to regulate membrane association of the G T βγ complex 22 . Comparison of our SCF-I2-Cdc4 structure and the phosducin-Gβγ structure reveals three highly similar features. First, the ligandbound forms of both structures exhibit an analogous buried-to-exposed transition of the conserved His residue at the apex of the connector between the affected blades (Fig. 3c) . Second, the Cdc4 and Gβ structures show a remarkably close juxtaposition of induced binding pockets for the SCF-I2 and farnesyl ligands, respectively (Fig. 3c) . Third, these rearrangements occur between blades 5 and 6 for both WD40 structures. That two functionally unrelated and evolutionarily distant proteins undergo similar induced conformational changes hints that allosteric responsiveness may be an intrinsic and conserved feature of the WD40 domain.
 In contrast to conventional protein interaction inhibitors that directly block the substrate binding site, such as the p53-Mdm2 inhibitor nutlin 23 , SCF-I2 elicits its effect by an allosteric mechanism. A structural feature of WD40 domains, and other β-propeller structures such as the Kelch domain, is the variability in blade number, which in known WD40 structures ranges from five to eight blades per domain 13 . The circular β-propeller structure can exhibit inter-blade separation 24 and structural tolerance to artificial insertion of an additional repeat 25 . WD40 domains may thus be inherently susceptible to disruption by insertion of appropriately configured small molecules between adjacent blades. Although it remains to be determined whether all WD40 domains exhibit allosteric responsiveness, in other protein families ultra-conserved residues can transmit long range allosteric effects 26 .
 To our knowledge, SCF-I2 represents the first example of a WD40 domain inhibitor. As our data with Cdc4 and Fbw7 shows, allosteric inhibition can discriminate between even highly related domains that recognize identical substrate motifs; it may be thus feasible to design other inhibitors that are selective for particular WD40 domain proteins. Moreover, allosteric inhibitors may be combined with conventional binding pocket inhibitors to increase potency 27 . The yeast genome encodes at least 113 proteins with WD40 or WD40-like domains that function in signaling, transcription, chromatin remodeling, mRNA splicing, DNA replication and repair, protein synthesis, the ubiquitin system, autophagy, vesicle trafficking, the cytoskeleton and organelle biogenesis (Supplementary Table 2 ). In humans, WD40 domains occur in at least 256 different proteins and perform similarly diverse functions (Supplementary Table 3 ). Biomedically important WD40 domain proteins include the F-box proteins Fbw7 and β-TrCP 8 , target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase complex subunits 28 and Gβ-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins 21, 27 . Our findings suggest that the WD40 domain may be generally accessible to allosteric modulation by small molecules.

Non-fluorescently labeled peptide Ac-GLLpTPPQSG was synthesized by Dalton Chemical (Toronto, Canada). Small molecules were purchased from Maybridge plc (Cornwall, England). Skp1-Cdc4 263-744 , Skp1-Cdc4 263-744 R655A , Skp1-Cdc4 263-744 R664A and Skp1-Fbw7 were purified as previously described 20 . Purified complexes were passed over a Superdex S75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT and concentrated to 20 mg/mL.
 A 50,000 compound Maybridge Screening Collection library (www.maybridge.com) was screened in a 384 well format on a Beckman-Coulter Integrated Robotic System at the McMaster University HTS Laboratory (Hamilton, Canada). Assays contained 0.21 μM Skp1-Cdc4 complex and 10 nM fluorescently labeled cyclin E-derived phosphopeptide in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 40 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg/mL BSA and 1 mM DTT in a final volume of 23.5 μL per well. 1.5 μL of each library compound from a 1 mM stock in DMSO was added to a final concentration of 60 μM, mixed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were excited at 485 nm and emission was read at 535 nm on an Analyst HT plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale CA). High controls contained 1.5 uL of DMSO only and low controls contained 1.5 μL of unlabelled cyclin E peptide in DMSO at a final concentration of 10 μM. Binding activity was calculated as the average sample value minus the mean of low controls divided by the mean of high controls minus the mean of low controls. Compounds were classified as initial hits if the binding value was below 50% of control. Dose response curves were carried out using the same conditions as above and EC 50 values calculated as previously described 17 . Determination of IC 50 was performed using a non-linear regression analysis using a sigmoidal dose response equation (variable slope) with no weighting or restraints (Graphpad Software, San Diego CA). mP units were normalized to no compound controls, i.e.,100% binding, for graphical representation.
 For full length phospho-Sic1 substrate interaction assays, compounds (50 μM final) were added to 500 ng of Gst Skp1-His Cdc4 263-744 immobilized to glutathione sepharose resin in PBS, incubated for 30 min at 4°C, followed by incubation with 0.1μM of phosphorylated Sic1 for 1 h at 4°C. Resin was washed 3 times with PBS and captured Sic1 protein visualized by anti-Sic1 immunoblot 30 . For ubiquitination assays, compounds were preincubated with recombinant E1 (0.4 μM), Cdc34 (2 μM), SCF Cdc4 (0.2 μM) for 15 min at room temperature in 12.5 μL reaction buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM ATP, 50 μM DTT and 24 μM ubiquitin. Reactions were initiated by addition of recombinant His Sic1 (0.2 μM) that had been previously phosphorylated with Cln2-Cdc28 kinase; reactions were incubated at 30°C for indicated times and products detected by anti-Sic1 immunoblot 30 . Ubiquitination of Met4 by SCF Met30 was carried out as described 19 .
 Crystals of Skp1-Cdc4 263-744 were derived as described previously 20 . Crystals were transferred to buffer containing 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 1.5 M ammonium sulfate, 15% glycerol and 1mM 1-(2-carboxynaphth-1-yl)-2-naphthoic acid (SCF-I2) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in order to incorporate SCF-I2 into the crystal lattice and to cryoprotect the crystal. Soaked crystals retained the same space group of P3 2 (a=108.281, b= 108.281, c=165.594, α=β=90°, γ =120°). The structure was refined to 2.6 Å to a working R value of 21.1% and R free of 26.3% (Supplementary Table 1 ). Details of data processing and refinement are provided in the Supplementary Information.

Will the accumulation of a biomolecular corona diminish activity? In doing so, we will deliver a detailed reference for both experts and those new to the field of NP technologies alike. The unique properties and size regime of NPs offer many benefits over small molecules and larger micrometre sized particles. These have been widely exploited within the biomedical field and reviewed extensively elsewhere. 1 As a result, severe side-effects may accompany any therapeutic benefit, while it is common for in vitro efficacy to be poorly translated to a clinical setting. 42 This is predominantly due to the significant challenges associated with translating NP stability under idealised conditions to the complex environments of biologically relevant scenarios. 43 Peptide and protein coatings play a major role in enabling NP based technologies, and their ability to provide both biological and physical stability will be summarised in this section ( Figure 2 , Table 2, and Table 3 ). Importantly, these two factors are not necessarily independent or complementary. It is therefore important to carefully consider design criteria in order to ensure that the end-application can be achieved. 44, 45 The nanoscale dimensions in themselves can lead to greatly altered pharmacokinetic properties when compared to small molecules in vivo. 46 This ability of NPs to modulate pharmacokinetics has been widely utilised as a means to improve the retention, biodistribution, or in vivo stability of an encapsulated small molecule. 53 Peng et al showed that such a strategy was able to limit phagocytosis and prolong circulation time in vivo, through simple NP pre-incubation in a solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA). 58, 81 Hydrophobin, an exogenous protein expressed by fungi has high affinity for NP surfaces and can also alter the composition of the protein corona when NPs are exposed to bodily fluids. 52 The high affinity of hydrophobin enables the protein to remain strongly associated with the NP surface, even when in competition with other plasma proteins. Apolipoprotein coatings have also been shown to increase NP circulation time. 82 The downstream effects of protein corona formation must also therefore be considered. 63, 64 Thus, physical stability and biological stability are intimately linked. 93, 94 The stability of the dispersion depends on the balance between attractive and repulsive forces -a particle becomes unstable and starts to agglomerate when the repulsive energy is not sufficient to counteract the van der Waals attractive energy. 95 Sufficient electrostatic and steric stabilization is required to provide the repulsive energy to prevent agglomeration. The formation of a protein corona upon application in vivo may either enhance or compromise NP colloidal stability. For example, depending on the capping layer utilised, unfunctionalised AuNPs are incredibly sensitive to environmental changes, with small changes in pH, salt concentration, temperature, or the presence of biomolecules often leading to rapid and irreversible aggregation. 26, 33, [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] Through combinatorial design, peptide sequences have been identified that are able to find a careful balance of charge, polarity, functionality, hydrophobicity, and length. 106] [107] [108] [109] Indeed, peptides such as CALNN can be used as a core peptide to which additional biological functionality can be attached, providing a stable peptide-functionalised inner corona bearing pendant peptides which can then direct and influence NP activity. [ 113] [114] [115] Although the concentration of free thiols in the blood is far lower than that observed intracellularly, it remains high enough to induce loss of monothiol coatings during circulation. 116 This is in part due to the possibility for dissociative ligand exchange (SN1-like pathway), in which ligands are rapidly diluted within serum upon dissociation, and replaced by circulating small molecule thiols. 118, 119 This loss of NP coating can lead to two, often concurrent outcomes in the dilute regime provided by in vivo settings: i) Replacement of the initial thiol coating by thiolated biomolecules, leading to a loss of any function imparted by the capping layer, as discussed throughout this review; and ii) Loss of any stabilization effects provided by the capping layer as ligands are gradually lost. 120 As a result, increasingly stabilised peptide coatings have been explored in recent years. 121] [122] [123] [124] In doing so, even with reversible desorption of one thiol group from the metal surface, the other is still attached maintaining stability. Alternatively, hexahistidine ligands offer strong and stable metal binding. This is particularly true for particles that are delivered systemically, rather than being applied directly at the desired site of action. Even once a particle has overcome the significant challenge of avoiding rapid clearance, the body places formidable barriers in the way of subsequent distribution and delivery of NPs at both the tissue and cellular level. The cell membrane is a selectively permeable barrier, which efficiently protects the cell interior from its environment. 133 Although in some cases the uptake of unfunctionalised particles is possible, cell membrane impermeability often results in a highly detrimental lack of activity. 137, 138 Furthermore, sequences able to efficiently promote endosomal escape following internalisation have also been identified and used to great effect. As a word of caution, it is important to note that the efficacy of both penetration and subsequent endosomal escape is highly dependent on the experimental conditions. 139,140 While a particular sequence may successfully mediate the transport of one NP cargo, it may fail to enable penetration of another. 141 Similarly, while uptake may be efficient with a cell line in vitro, such results may not be readily replicated in the corresponding tissue upon in vivo translation. 110, 144 This is followed by permanent or transient destabilization of the cell membrane, for example through pore or inverted micelle formation. The exact mechanism by which a particular NP is internalised is a vast area of research, and one which often remains contentious. 133, 147, 139, 148 It has become increasingly evident that it is difficult to draw generalisations. Importantly, the precise means by which a particular construct is taken up is highly dependent on not only the peptide sequence used to promote uptake, but also on the target cell type, and perhaps most strongly the exact nature of the NP cargo, including size, structure, and surface properties. a specific biological interaction -rather it is the density or distribution of positive charges along the peptide backbone that are responsible for internalisation. 163 The strong affinity of positively charged peptides towards negatively charged endosomal membrane components may hinder endosomal escape. For example, aliphatic hydrazones may display insufficient stability to allow application in vivo, 170 while diaryl linkages may prove too stable to allow acid responsive behaviour to be displayed. This has been validated by a number of subsequent reportsa lower coverage of peptides bearing multiple CPP arms often results in a higher cell uptake than that observed for particles coated with a high density of mono-valent peptides, though the effect is not universal. However, the same particles were then rapidly processed and exocytosed, leading to an overall drop in penetration efficiency. Unless for tissue imaging purposes, this location is typically not the end target, with delivery to the cytosol or nucleus usually necessary for activity. 181 The N-terminal domain of influenza virus hemagglutinin HA2 was one of the earliest sequences identified, with Plank et al demonstrating that HA2 functionalisation of DNA-based NPs greatly enhanced cell transduction. An alternative approach to enhance escape has recently been reported by Morshed and co-workers. By attaching TAT peptides to AuNPs via an acid labile hydrazone linkage, they were able to promote endosomal escape through cleavage of the CPP. While this is not in itself problematic, it is important to have in mind the possible effects of impaired cellular junctions on NP transport in such systems. As a result, strategies improving specificity for brain targeting represent a more attractive solution. Receptors for the closely related iron-binding protein lactoferrin (Lf) are also commonly over-expressed at the BBB. Importantly, they both display extremely low associated toxicities and are therefore key components of a number of technologies currently in clinical trials. 166, [220] [221] [222] [223] [224] [225] [226] [227] [228] [229] Similarly, GSH decoration has been used extensively to deliver NPs, particularly drug-loaded liposomes, across the BBB. [ 226 In addition to these prominent examples, a number of other peptide sequences have been identified which are able to mediate transport across the BBB. 253 By screening peptides against cancer cells they were able to identify a consensus (R/K)XX(R/K) sequence which promoted cell uptake. However, a smaller number of peptide sequences have been identified that are able to promote both processes, first targeting NP delivery to the tumour, then penetrating away from the vasculature via receptor mediated transcytosis. They imply the rational targeting of particles through design rather than natural distribution, and active guiding to the target site rather than localisation through chance encounters respectively. 268 While this may also enable targeting of the liver and spleen, in which NPs are naturally deposited following clearance from the blood, other organs and tissues require more sophisticated 'active' means of directing delivery. Furthermore, their surface loading can be controlled, enabling the simultaneous presentation of multiple targeting sequences, providing high affinity and synergistic binding. However it is also possible to systemically deliver phage libraries in vivo. Using this technique, phage binding to a target tissue or organ have been isolated and peptide sequences mediating cargo transport to the desired location identified. In a similar manner, the tumour-homing pentapeptide CREKA was also identified from phage libraries, and found to target the clotted plasma proteins that accumulate within the interstitial tissue and vessel walls in cancerous masses ( Figure 15 ). 253-255 iRGD coated NPs have been shown to be efficient vehicles for drug-delivery and imaging applications. [ Sequences also exist for directing particles to a specific cancer, through binding to over-expressed tissue-specific receptors. For example, the bladder cancer binding peptide Bld-1 was identified from whole cell phage-panning by Lee et al. 307 Importantly, this peptide displayed affinity for the extravascular tissue, rather than the blood vessels themselves. 271 Agemy et al combined the mitochondrial targeting peptide (KLAKLAK)2 with tumour-targeting CGKRK and penetrating iRGD sequences, to form a tri-functional iron oxide NP coating, able to efficiently deliver particles within mouse glioblastoma models. By doing so, the efficiency of synthetic vaccines can be greatly enhanced in vivo as discussed in section 7, leading to an improvement in the generation of immunity. 309,310 
 The recognition of protein binding partners by cell-surface receptors is one of the most important interactions in biology. Instead, it is the ability of the targeting group to induce penetration and uptake within the target tissue that leads to an enhancement of the therapeutic efficiency of NP drug-delivery vehicles. 315, 316 Salvati et al have also highlighted the importance of carefully designing NP coatings in order to maintain maximal activity in vivo. 313, 314, 316, [318] [319] [320] [321] Many other protein ligands have also found widespread use for the selective targeting of NPs to cell surface receptors within a specific tissue or organ. While this may be favourable in certain applications, in such cases the protein substrate is not merely acting as a targeting motif but is also controlling or inducing a biological effect. Furthermore, cell-surface adhesion motifs can also be targeted. 328 High density lipoproteins (HDLPs) have also found utility for selective NP delivery. 329 Similarly, apolipoprotein A-I, the major component of HDLPs, has been demonstrated to enable the selective delivery of fluorescent NPs to cancerous tissue in vivo. 331 A number of groups have subsequently used WGA to induce the intra-nasal transport of functionalised NPs, due to its ability to both bind and promote transcellular delivery across the epithelial barriers of the nasal passageway. [ 335 Oral delivery of UEA-1 labelled antigen containing NPs enables the initiation of a mucosal immune response and vaccination of the recipient. It is therefore unsurprising that Ab-NP conjugates have found widespread utility in the biomedical field. 275, 339, 12, [340] [341] [342] The ability of Abs to neutralise the effect of their target or to induce a favourable biological response allows their use as therapeutic agents in their own right. They have also commonly been exploited to deliver a therapeutic cargo, in the form of an Ab-drug conjugate (ADC). Ab fragments may therefore retain binding affinity of the full length construct, though in some cases bisantigen binding is necessary to maintain full affinity. 342 Both full length and fragment Abs have been extensively used to target the delivery of NP cargoes, as have naturally occurring single domain camelid Abs. 342, 375 To this extent, Greene et al recently reported a strategy to functionally re-bridge distal disulphide bonds within a trastuzumab fragment-Ab, enabling orientated Ab display on the surface of PLGA-PEG NPs and a corresponding increase in binding efficiency when compared to non-specific Ab conjugation. NP-polypeptide conjugates are able to effectively mimic the behaviour of these structures, stimulating signalling pathways and eliciting cellular responses. As these topics have already been covered in detail above, in this section we will focus on the ability of NPpolypeptide constructs to mimic the multi-valent display of antigens present on the surfaces of pathogens and tumour cells. NP vaccines can offer the benefits of increasing antigen stability over soluble delivery. Furthermore, their nanoscale size may promote scavenging by dendritic cells and therefore improve T-cell presentation, minimising the activation of alternative immune response pathways. 388 As such, the presentation of multiple antigens on the NP surface can play a far more effective role in modulating the immune response than presentation of free peptide or protein motifs. The Yu group demonstrated that enhanced antigen clustering elicits a stronger immune response than uniformly distributed ligands at both the micron and nano scale. In contrast, 'soft' particles able to encapsulate a payload have commonly been utilised for the delivery of antigen following particle recognition and subsequent release. However, recent reports on their toxicity may limit further development towards applications in patients. 420 Careful NP design is therefore key in ensuring that the desired response is triggered. Similarly, peptide-lipid amphiphiles have also been studied, as discussed in section 8, for their ability to self-assemble into peptide-decorated micelles. 421 Importantly, the crowded environment provided by such a set-up has been found to induce peptides to adopt a secondary structure more akin to their natural presentation within the parent protein. 415, 422 As a result, the Abs generated downstream are better able to produce an effective response when subsequently challenged. While applications using peptide-and protein-NP conjugates as vaccines to stimulate a protective immune response to previously unencountered antigens have been most widely studied, technologies which modulate the immune system, and in particular mitigate auto-immunity, have begun to emerge. In a healthy individual, tolerance of self-antigens is maintained by the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Indeed, in many of the scenarios to be discussed in this section the particle is composed entirely of peptide or protein components. 427 Although individually these interactions may be weak, cumulatively they are able to define the secondary and tertiary structures of complex native protein architectures, and can be exploited to produce a vast array of self-assembled structures on both the nano-and micro-scale. The formation of architectures, ranging from fibres and tubes, through to vesicles and micelles, and on to more elaborate structures such as crystals and donuts can all be instigated. [ The conditions for the formation of these structures are often strict, requiring precise control over composition, assembly conditions, and handling. 427, 429, 430, [437] [438] [439] [440] It should be noted that we will not cover nanosized aggregates of globular proteins in this review, such as those formed by serum albumins or gelatin, which have found increasing clinical use in recent years. Such systems do not rely on the specific selfassembly of polypeptide components, and thus fall outside the scope of this review. A number of reviews focussed on these topics have recently been published. 441-444
 Dipeptides represent the simplest self-assembling peptide motif. 446, 448, 449 Despite this apparent plasticity, dipeptide NPs exhibit remarkable stability. 451 Although this promising system has only so far been demonstrated in vitro, it offers an attractive means through which to produce simple, photo-stable, biocompatible NPs for in vivo imaging in the future. Amphiphilic peptides, containing both a hydrophobic and hydrophilic domain, can be broadly split into three categories: i) Those composed only of native amino acids (with or without minor modifications at the termini); ii) Those containing unnatural amino acids; and iii) Lipid-or polymer-conjugated peptide hybrids. This situation is further complicated in complex biological fluid. [ 456, 457 SA2 is a rationally-designed amphiphilic sequence containing sequential hydrophobic residues of decreasing bulk, leading to a cone-shaped monomer that promotes the formation of spherical architectures, with a CAC of 0.5 μM prior to crosslinking. As an extension to the use of linear peptide amphiphiles, higher order, repetitively branched peptide dendrimers with increased bulk and a unique globular architecture have also found utility. On their own, dendrimers do not typically interact sufficiently to form stable self-assembled structures. This amphiphilic, supramolecular dendrimer can then further self-assemble into nano-sized micelles, capable of encapsulating a hydrophobic drug or DNA cargo. 466 Assembly is driven first by the exclusion of hydrophobic residues form the aqueous exterior, and then stabilised and enhanced by inter-strand electrostatic interactions between polar and charged amino acids. 466, [468] [469] [470] Coiled-coil peptides were first used in the nanotechnology field by Stevens et al to drive the assembly of AuNPs into higher order aggregates. Importantly, the coiled-coil core has been shown to only be weakly immunogenic itself. 476, 478, 479 
 The non-viral delivery of DNA or RNA to cells is a powerful emerging technique for the treatment of disease. Wu and Wu were amongst the first to report peptide-nucleic acid NP mediated gene delivery. Complexes of plasmid DNA and polylysine were shown to efficiently deliver their cargo to cells in vitro. This is in part due to the trade-off between the toxicity associated with longer cationic peptides, and the low particle stability when shorter sequences are used instead. In both cases, preferential accumulation and subsequent nucleic acid delivery in the tumour tissue was achieved following intravenous injection. This was observed to prevent the potential side-effects that can occur as a result of systemic transfection. The aggregation of ELPs can be exploited to form spherical, nano-sized cargo-delivery vehicles via a number of different strategies. Through suitable design of the sequence, Tt can be modulated to be slightly higher than body temperature. Peptide self-assembly can then be driven at the site of interest through the application of localised hyperthermia. [ 501 In spite of this sensitivity, the hyperthermia induced assembly of ELP NPs can still be used enhance the activity of attached drugs such as doxorubicin, promoting both retention and uptake at the site of heat application. Casein is the collective term for a family of phosphorylated proteins commonly found in milk. 514 Unlike other proteins which may form globular aggregates, caseins are able to undergo controlled self-assembly to form stable micelle-like structures in aqueous solution with a CAC of 20-80 μM. 515 This is particularly true, when individual casein family members, most notably β-casein, are used in isolation rather than as the naturally occurring mixture. 520 These promising early reports, coupled to the ease of use, inexpensive production, bio-degradable, non-toxic and non-immunogenic nature of casein micelles makes them particularly appealing as delivery-vehicles. 33 The most common sensing platforms rely on a change in optical properties in the presence of the desired analyte or biomarker, or selective binding of a NP complex within a 'detection-region'. The reader is instead referred to a number of excellent comprehensive reviews on the topic for further details. 528 NP based systems offer a viable alternative, but also have their own complicationsin addition to the challenges of generating a signal that can be actively transduced for detection, NPs must overcome background signal generation within the complex environment of the body, be retained at the desired site of detection, and ideally provide a reversible and dynamic response. 530 This response was reversible upon diffusion of oxygen back into the biological milieu, with only a limited dropoff in polymer dynamic range observed upon repeated applications. 532 Due to their size, these particles were blocked from renal clearance and displayed accumulation in the liver. 535 Furthermore, the sub-cutaneous implantation of 8 nm peptide-functionalised PEG-NPs, which enable gradual leaching of a particle reservoir into the blood stream, has recently been shown to allow the continuous monitoring of protease activity in vivo, although detection was still limited to a 24 hr time period. In many cases, both peptides and proteins can fulfil the desired function. Furthermore, the small size of peptides enables the disruption of NP hydrodynamic diameter and detrimental effects on activity to be minimised, while creating a dense, accessible, and flexible coverage of active sequences (Figure 24a and d). The situation is further complicated by the complex interplay between peptide/protein components and the particular NP core, cargo, application, and delivery route. As such, consideration of the precise polypeptide component is a vital step during NP-conjugate design. In this review, a number of approaches have been introduced towards addressing these difficulties. Unnatural amino acids are particularly effective, providing peptide bonds which are not recognised and processed by native enzymes. 217,537,538 While increased stability is harder to achieve with protein substrates, the advent of technologies which allow the introduction of non-natural stabilising residues, 539,540 the addition of protective polymer coatings, 541, 542 or the formation of additional cross-links 543, 544 are now allowing such issues to be addressed. Nowhere is this more strongly felt than in the reduced ability of short synthetic peptides (< 30 amino acids) to target and bind a particular protein or cell type when compared to Abs or other binding proteins. 545 There is a therefore a pressing need for technologies which can bring short peptide binding affinities down from the μM to the nM range. 342, 550, 551 iv) Many of the applications for peptide/protein-NP conjugates discussed in this review rely on processes that are still poorly understood at a fundamental level. In order to provide NP technologies that meet the challenging demands of biomedical applications it is important that these topics, and many others within the field, continue to be investigated and that a deeper understanding of the intertwined complexities that determine NP fate is provided. 172 This challenge must be addressed by both the development of new tools which are able to reflect the true nature of NP complexes, as well as increased uptake by researchers of existing technologies, and a more thorough approach to NP characterisation being taken. 552, 553 At present, many systems reported in the literature are inadequately characterised, leading to large discrepancies in results, conflicting reports, and incorrect interpretations that subsequently propagate throughout the field. The inherent complexity of NPbioconjugates makes them undoubtedly challenging to studyeven what appears a simple measurement such as the concentration of particles in solution is often difficult. 553] [554] [555] [556] A big leap towards enabling the clinical translation of many peptide/protein-NP conjugate technologies will be taken as the biomedical community addresses these issues. As a result, our ability to treat, diagnose, and understand disease will be greatly enhanced, and allow nano-technology to fulfil its undoubted promise in the biomedical sciences."
43,43,be1a1a2154d6ef7211f509548e37103a8eaa24ff,,Keeping it in check: chronic viral infection and antiviral immunity in the brain HHS Public Access,"It is becoming clear that the manner by which the immune response resolves or contains infection by a pathogen varies according to the tissue that is affected. Unlike many peripheral cell types, CNS neurons are generally non-renewable. Thus, the cytolytic and inflammatory strategies that are effective in controlling infections in the periphery could be damaging if deployed in the CNS. Perhaps for this reason, the immune response to some CNS viral infections favours maintenance of neuronal integrity and non-neurolytic viral control. This modified immune response -when combined with the unique anatomy and physiology of the CNS -provides an ideal environment for the maintenance of viral genomes, including those of RNA viruses. Therefore, it is possible that such viruses can reactivate long after initial viral exposure, contributing to CNS disease.
 An oversimplification that is promoted in much of the scientific literature is that extracellular, receptor-binding ligands -including viruses, cytokines and interferons (IFNs) -transduce invariant signalling pathways, independent of cell type. Such generalizations limit our ability to fully appreciate the complexity and diversity of the cellular response to pathogens and potent pathogen-fighting proteins. There are also clinical ramifications of this myopic view: for example, ignoring the possibility that a particular cell population may behave uniquely upon cytokine encounter could limit drug efficacy or hinder the development of therapeutics. In this Review, we discuss some recently defined neuronspecific immune responses that broaden our view of how CNS infections, especially those caused by RNA viruses, are controlled.
 Intuitively, the notion that neurons differ immunologically from other cell types makes sense: we cannot tolerate the loss of these generally non-renewable cells, as we can the lysis of more-easily replaceable epithelial cells. For example, herpes simplex virus (HSV)","infection of epithelial cells results in massive immune-and virus-mediated cell death [1] [2] [3] ; however, the lost cells are readily replaced, as observed in the healing that follows a cold sore. If lysis of irreplaceable neurons occurred in the same manner, neural circuits could become compromised, and, depending on the magnitude of damage, the host could be permanently impaired. Thus, the immune response to a viral challenge must be tailored to promote survival of infected neurons but to destroy infected epithelial or endothelial cells. However, such neuronal sparing might result in long-term consequences that are spatially or temporally separated from acute infection.
 In this Review, we integrate insights from the fields of virology, neurobiology and immunology to provide an overview of the mechanisms by which the restricted environment of the CNS is accessed by both RNA viruses and DNA viruses, and to explain how the host response contends with such infections. We particularly focus on a developing literature that elucidates cell-specific immunity and the consequences of non-lytic viral clearance within the brain. We conclude with a forward-looking hypothesis: non-lytic clearance of neuronal infections may allow for persistence of RNA viruses that induce pathogenesis long after primary exposure.
 The brain is shielded from external threats at both macro-and microscopic levels: it is encased in bone, to prevent physical injury, and separated from peripheral tissues and blood via highly specialized barriers. Although such characteristics may limit infections of CNSresident cells, these barriers can be breached. Three major routes of viral entry into the brain have been identified: direct infection of the cells that comprise the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (BCSF) barrier (with consequent release of viral particles into the parenchyma), infection of cells that are able to cross these barriers, and transneuronal migration across synapses from the peripheral nervous system (PNS) into the CNS (FIG. 1) .
 Within the CNS, the BBB and BCSF barrier restrict the migration and diffusion of cells, pathogens, antibodies and macromolecules into the brain parenchyma. Neurotropic RNA viruses, including poliovirus (PV), measles virus (MV) and some flaviviruses, can circumvent these barriers by directly infecting the tightly associated endothelial or epithelial cells that comprise them 4 . Viral particles can then be released from the basolateral membrane into the parenchyma. For example, after MV infection of human brain microvascular endothelial cells, release of viral particles occurs from both the apical and basolateral membranes, without disrupting cell polarity or barrier integrity, allowing MV to spread into the parenchyma 5 . Alternatively, barrier integrity may be compromised when the tight junctions between cells loosen as a result of inflammation and cytokine exposure, allowing free viral particles to diffuse directly from the blood or CSF into the brain. For example, peripheral West Nile virus (WNV) infection acts through the engagement of Tolllike receptor 3 (TLR3) to induce the synthesis of cytokines -including tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -by circulating antigen-presenting cells 6 . In turn, TNF reduces BBB integrity by loosening tight junctions 7 , allowing for WNV migration through the less-restrictive BBB.
 In reality, however, modulating the barrier integrity is not as simple as this description implies. The balance of different cytokines can determine the extent to which the BBB is perturbed or stabilized. For example, IFNs, which are also produced in infected hosts, help to keep the barrier intact 8 ; thus, the relative type and ratios of cytokines that are synthesized in response to various infections will differentially affect barrier integrity 9 .
 Viruses may also passively access resident CNS cells by infecting lymphocytes or monocytes that can be transported across a cellular barrier. This strategy is often referred to as the 'Trojan horse' approach, because viral particles are released once the blood cell gains access to the parenchyma. A classic example of this mode of invasion is provided by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1): CD16 + monocytes, permissive for HIV-1, traffic across the BBB and release virions that can then infect CNS microglia 10, 11 .
 A third mode of CNS entry is transneuronal migration, a strategy adopted by rabies virus (RABV) and many herpesviruses, including pseudorabies virus (PRV). Intracellular trafficking in PNS neurons, which is necessary to shuttle cellular components to and from the synapse, can be commandeered to facilitate viral travel within and among synaptically connected neurons. The best-characterized examples of this type of spread are provided by herpesvirus members such as HSV type 1 (HSV-1) and the closely related PRV 4, 12 . After infection of epithelial cells in the oral mucosa, HSV-1 spreads to sensory and autonomic ganglia, establishing lifelong latency. Reactivation of the virus from latency -in response to decreases in immune monitoring, other infections or stress -leads to an active infection in PNS neurons, in which viral membrane proteins (including US9, glycoprotein E and glycoprotein I) can direct movement of newly replicated viral particles in an anterograde manner 13 . During transport, viral components are shuttled along axons via microtubule tracks and in association with their dynein and kinesin motors 14, 15 . Sensory neurons have a pseudo-unipolar morphology in which one axon is in contact with epithelial cells and the other synapses are in contact with CNS neurons 12 . Beyond the value of these studies to understand how neurotropic viruses are propagated, viruses that spread across synapses (including RABV and MV) have provided a valuable method to trace neural circuits in vivo 16, 17 ; that is, the use of recombinant viruses encoding fluorescent proteins. These unique virological tools may also allow the development of strategies to deliver therapeutic payloads from the periphery to the CNS.
 Once a virus has infected a neuron, there are two primary modes of subsequent spread to other cells: the release of infectious viral particles that can infect distant permissive cells or the transfer of viral nucleic acid, subviral particles or infectious virions between infected and uninfected cells that are in direct contact. The former mechanism requires the release of viral particles through the neuronal membrane (chiefly, via budding out of the infected cell), whereas the latter mechanism is primarily dependent on viral proteins that mimic or co-opt cellular processes to direct the insertion of viral fusion proteins into a host cell membrane or to direct the spread of viral capsids, as seen with HSV 12, 18 . Both modes of viral spread occur in neurons; however, in most instances, viral transfer to adjacent neurons happens in the absence of syncytia formation (BOX 1), and little or no amount of extracellular infectious virus is detected, suggesting that neurons facilitate a distinct mode of spread for many viruses 4 . Interestingly, trans-synaptic spread of MV within primary mouse hippocampal neurons occurs independently of known MV receptors, which are crucial for syncytia formation in non-neuronal cells 19, 20 . The paucity of viral particles in the extracellular space may protect the neuron from plasma membrane damage via budding and facilitate evasion of antibody detection. Although many neurotropic infections spread by direct contact at the presynaptic-postsynaptic junction, alternative modes of transport may also be used. For example, although RABV primarily spreads trans-synaptically in a retrograde manner, an electron microscopy study showed the presence of viral particles in the extracellular neuronal space, accompanied by direct neuronal budding 21 .
 An outcome of viral neuroinvasion is that the viral genome, viral proteins and/or complete virus particles may remain in the brain long after initial exposure. To describe the myriad ways by which viruses establish enduring interactions with host neurons, numerous descriptors have been used, including 'prolonged', 'persistent', 'latent', 'smouldering', 'quiescent' and 'chronic' (REFS 4, 22, 23 ); however, their use is not consistent. Variablesincluding detection threshold, target organs and cell-specific influences on the viral life cycle -collectively contribute to the challenge of establishing an agreed-upon nomenclature. Moreover, some viruses can reactivate to cause the same disease as the acute infection (such as HSV), whereas others manifest differently upon reactivation (such as varicella zoster virus (VZV), which causes chicken pox as a primary infection but typically causes shingles upon reactivation). Other viruses result in pathogenesis only after protracted infection (such as tumour-causing viruses).
 For this Review, we use three classifications. Latent infections are defined as those in which the virus establishes a non-lytic state during which host-to-host transmission is not possible, unless the virus reactivates to produce infectious virions. Chronic transmissible infections are characterized by the continuous production of infectious viral progeny and their ability to be transferred to new hosts. Chronic non-transmissible infections are those in which consistent detection of viral nucleic acid over extended periods of time is observed but in which transmission to new hosts does not occur.
 Latency is most frequently attributed to herpesvirus infections, such as HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV. After initial infection of epithelial cells, these viruses become non-lytic within PNS neurons, and viral nucleic acid is maintained in a heterochromatin episomal state with negligible transcription 12 . A small number of viral transcripts are synthesized during latency and are termed latency-associated transcripts. These RNA species do not encode functional proteins but are thought to prevent neuronal apoptosis and to disrupt both innate and adaptive immune signalling through mechanisms that include inhibition of caspase activity and of granzyme B-mediated killing 24, 25 . VZV also produces various proteins, including ORF63, that prevent neuronal apoptosis 24 . The term 'latent' accurately conveys the status of these viruses: hidden, incapable of transmission, but able to fully reactivate, spread, and be transmitted to a new host. Another type of latency, which is not typically seen in neurons, occurs after viral nucleic acid is reverse transcribed from RNA to DNA and then integrated into the host genome. This process is unique to retroviruses, such as HIV-1 (REF. 26 ). In this type of latency, integrated viral genomic DNA becomes indistinguishable from host DNA, and viral genes can be epigenetically silenced or activated throughout the cell lifetime and passed on to daughter cells.
 In a chronic transmissible infection, the infectious virus can be continuously recovered from the host and can be disseminated to new hosts, as in hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Mice infected with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) offer a well-characterized model of a chronic transmissible CNS infection. LCMV infection of newborn mice leads to a non-cytopathic chronic infection in almost every tissue. Infectious LCMV particles can be recovered from multiple organs throughout life and can be shed in the faeces or transmitted vertically to offspring 23, 27, 28 . Although most strains of mice survive LCMV infection with no overt pathogenic consequences, some studies reported learning and memory deficits in these chronically infected animals 29 , underscoring the potentially subtle effects of long-term infection on CNS function.
 Chronic non-transmissible infections are also characterized by sustained viral replication or consistent detection of viral nucleic acid over extended periods of time, but further host dissemination is absent. One example may be the rare cases of MV CNS infection. Acute infection can, in some instances, lead to the development of neuropathogenic diseases, including subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and measles inclusion-body encephalitis. These uncommon neurological diseases often present months or years after viral exposure and are characterized either by negligible replication or by persistence of replication-competent nucleic acid in the CNS [30] [31] [32] . In both diseases, no viral dissemination to uninfected hosts has been reported. Determining whether the state of the virus that causes these sequelae is 'latent' or 'chronic non-transmissible' is difficult, owing to both the small number of clinical specimens available and the lack of small animal models that mimic SSPE disease 31, 33, 34 . In humans, it may be that neurological symptoms appear only once viral replication reaches a crucial threshold or when the virus infects a key site within the brain, exceeding the host's capacity to control the infection. Alternatively, non-replicating MV genomes may be maintained for prolonged periods and reactivated later. Either way, the MV genome remains intact, in some form, long after control of the acute infection is achieved, in the absence of further viral dissemination.
 A final point of clarification: not all neurotropic viruses are associated with long-lasting infections. Some viruses, such as the reovirus, can induce neuronal apoptosis through the induction of pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX 35, 36 . The reason why some infections lead to neuronal suicide, whereas others lead to a long (potentially unhappy) 'marriage' between the host and the virus, is a major focus in the field of neurovirology, and answering this question may lead to the discovery of virus-specific therapies to prevent or minimize infection-triggered neuropathology.
 The various permutations of neurotropic viral infections pose unique challenges for the host, including detecting antigens within the CNS, enabling T lymphocytes to engage with neurons that express negligible levels of proteins that are typically present on target cells, and mitigating the risks of neuroinflammation and widespread loss of generally nonrenewable neurons.
 The early response to an infection typically begins with the engagement of pathogenic motifs by pattern recognition receptors, which are expressed on (or in) virtually all cells. The binding of these receptors to conserved motifs, such as double-stranded RNA, lipopolysaccharides or glycoproteins, propagates signals that culminate in the production of type I IFNs, chiefly IFNα and IFNβ. These IFNs are secreted from the infected cell and act in both a paracrine and an autocrine manner by binding to IFN α/β receptor (IFNAR), a heterotetramer with phosphorylatable cytoplasmic domains. This engagement leads to the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases (including Janus kinases) and the receptor itself, and is followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2, which are usually abundant but inactive within the cytoplasm. Activated STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers couple with IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form the complex termed ISGF3, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to IFN-stimulated response elements within the promoters of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These genes encode proteins that eliminate infected cells or aid in viral clearance. Type I IFNs also bind to adjacent, uninfected cells to shield them from infection. Although this pathway is operative in many cells, alternative IFN-triggered pathways that limit viral spread but do not depend on induction of the 'usual suspects', the ISGs, can be induced in some cell types, including neurons 37 .
 Neurons also secrete type I IFNs, which can act in an autocrine or paracrine manner on neurons or other parenchymal cell types 38 . RABV, which infects muscle cells and peripheral neurons after a bite from an infected animal, induces copious IFN secretion early after infection, in vivo and in vitro 39 . By contrast, IFN-induced STAT phosphorylation in primary hippocampal neurons is delayed, with maximal activation occurring only after ~24 hours 40, 41 . Delayed STAT activation coincides with delayed expression of traditional ISGs 41 . The protracted interval between receptor binding and STAT activation may be due to a greatly reduced basal expression of STATs in these hippocampal neurons, as compared with other cell types [40] [41] [42] . Interestingly, lower homeostatic STAT expression is not unique to neurons but has also been observed in another non-renewable cell type, cardiac myocytes 43 . Like neurons, cardiac myocytes have high basal IFNβ expression, which may protect them from infection 41, 43 . Perhaps, the disparity between expression of IFNs and the signal transduction molecules that they induce may skew towards protection from infection rather than towards induction of a potentially cytotoxic response. Surprisingly, synthesis of ISGs can differ within a single neuron: IFNβ induces a non-canonical, local antiviral response in axons that is not observed in the neuronal soma 44, 45 . The startling implication of this finding is that neurons, especially those with long processes (as in the PNS), may 'compartmentalize' the response to extracellular immune mediators.
 Although much of this Review focuses on neuronal responses to infections and antiviral cytokines, it is important to underscore that differential responses to, and production of, type I IFNs have been demonstrated in other parenchymal cell populations and may influence the neuronal response. For example, when comparing microglia and oligodendroglia collected from mice that were infected with a neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), it was shown that microglia are the main producers of type I IFN and downstream ISG products 46 . Overall, the fact that different cell types show distinct homeostatic expression of key signal transducers and of their downstream gene targets underscores the cellular diversity that can follow cytokine engagement.
 Perhaps predictably, for many neurotropic RNA viruses, including MV, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, Murray Valley encephalitis virus, WNV and others, experimentally induced loss of type I IFN signalling results in pathogenesis, altered viral tropism (generally accompanied by increased neurovirulence) and an inability to control viral spread both in vivo and in vitro 41, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . Although most of these studies were performed using IFNARknockout mice lacking receptor expression on all cells, selective disruption of neuronal IFN signalling (using neuron-specific knockouts of IFNAR) also results in death after vesicular stomatitis virus infection 55 . Moreover, infection of olfactory neurons and mucosa with either a neurotropic RNA virus (vesicular stomatitis virus) or a neurotropic DNA virus (cytomegalovirus) leads to a robust type I IFN response deep within the brain, preventing viral spread and attendant disease 56 . Thus, infection of cells in direct contact with the environment (including sensory olfactory neurons) can trigger a long-distance warning (production of type I IFNs) that ultimately limits or precludes viral spread to remote regions of the brain.
 For some time, it was known that the primary cell populations of the adaptive immune system, T cells and B cells, contributed to viral control within the brain; however, the apparent absence of a CNS lymphatic drainage system made it complicated to understand how antigens could exit the parenchyma to promote the activation and proliferation of naive antigen-specific T cells 7 . Recent findings have begun to resolve this mystery: these include the identification of lymphatic drainage portals from the CNS into deep cervical lymph nodes and the presence of a fluid gradient that flushes the brain of extracellular proteins (which are termed 'glymphatics' because of the crucial role of glia in this process) [57] [58] [59] . CSF moves towards the perivascular space, where it is transported into the dense brain parenchyma via aquaporin 4 water channels that are expressed on cortical astrocytes. The CSF movement drives the interstitial fluid towards perivenous spaces, where it then drains towards the newly identified meningeal or dura mater lymphatic vessels, and ultimately to the deep cervical lymph nodes, where T cell activation and proliferation can occur 57,59,60 . These studies indicated how antigens and professional antigen-presenting cells can exit the CNS to alert immature T cells in the lymph nodes.
 After T cells mature in lymphoid tissues, they enter the bloodstream, where they can interact with adhesion molecules that are expressed on the surface of blood vessel endothelia within infected tissues. Mature T cells chiefly engage with selectins (and later, integrins) on the surface of the BBB or BCSF barrier. The expression of these adhesion molecules is induced by chemokines that are produced within the parenchyma by infected neurons and adjacent glia. This results in migration of T cells across the barrier (diapedesis). Although it was previously believed that neurons do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (and thus could not be recognized, at least in the canonical manner, by CD8 + T cells), we now know that some neuronal populations constitutively synthesize these cell surface proteins and that others can induce their expression after injury or infection 61, 62 . Even so, most neurons do not express typical levels of MHC class I antigens under noninflammatory conditions 63 , and thus T cell effector functions, including cytokine production, may not be triggered by the infected cell (the neuron) directly but rather by adjacent MHC class I-expressing cells (usually glia) that can display antigenic peptides via crosspresentation 64 . Although cross-presenting glia may not be directly infected, this strategy allows for elaboration of antiviral processes. Resident CNS cells may not only be invisible to immune cells as a result of reduced expression of MHC recognition molecules but may also express immunomodulatory molecules, such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1) 65 , that down-modulate T effector functions. Remarkably, the MHC class I expression system that is key to T cell recognition is likely to have also other functions in neurons, including those involved in neurodevelopment and neuronal plasticity 66, 67 .
 One of the major strategies that is used by activated T cells to combat neuronal viral infections is the production of IFNγ. Similar to type I IFNs, IFNγ transduces a signal via receptor binding, leading to STAT1 activation and homodimerization. Activated STAT1 homodimers translocate into the nucleus and bind to gamma-activated sequences (GASs) in the promoters of approximately 100 genes (which overlap with, but are generally distinct from, the ISGs that are induced by type I IFNs), promoting their transcription and translation (FIG. 2a) . The products of these genes, similar to ISG proteins, combat viral infection or induce apoptosis of the infected cell 37 .
 STAT1 can be activated in neurons after IFNγ exposure, but the kinetics of induction are markedly slower than those observed in treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts, similar to the delayed response that is seen after type I IFN exposure 40 . In addition, IFNγ induces transcription of both traditional genes (that is, those that are typically expressed in response to IFNγ in other cellular populations) and non-traditional genes in primary hippocampal neurons after exposure 68 . This diverse profile of genes that are induced may affect the cellular outcome: although IFNγ can induce necroptosis, in neurons the virus is controlled in a non-cytolytic manner (presumably owing to the paucity of STAT1 and non-traditional GAS gene induction) 69, 70 (FIG. 2b) . This feature is not unique to neurons: IFNγ is also essential for controlling MHV infection of oligodendrocytes via non-cytolytic pathways 71, 72 . How are genes activated when basal levels of available STAT1 are low in resting neurons? Interestingly, when challenged with a neuron-restricted MV infection, most STAT1knockout mice survive. By contrast, all IFNγ-knockout mice show severe signs of chronic disease, with approximately 50% succumbing to infection 68, 70 , suggesting that the requirement for IFNγ is decoupled from the main transducer through which it signals. This observation led to the identification of an IFNγ-dependent, STAT1-independent activation of antiviral and pro-survival genes 68, 73 , which might be facilitated by the access of other signalling factors -including extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and AKT -to the activated IFNγ receptor when STAT1 is absent or not abundant (FIG. 2b,c) .
 IFNγ is crucial for the control of multiple neurotropic viral infections in mice and primary neuronal cultures. Recently, IFNγ was identified as a key suppressor of HSV and VZV reactivation in the trigeminal ganglion of both humans and mice 24, [74] [75] [76] [77] . What makes these studies particularly intriguing is the type of T cell that is shown to be constitutively secreting IFNγ: T resident memory cells (T rm ) [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . T rm (defined by CD103 and CD69 expression) are in direct proximity to latently infected PNS neurons and do not re-enter circulation. Furthermore, these brain-resident lymphocytes have a unique molecular signature that distinguishes them from other types of cytotoxic T cells or from memory T cells 80 . T rm populations expand and contract in their resident tissue, acting as a first line of defence against reinfection 81 . Moreover, as we suggest below, these cells may be crucial sentinels that keep chronic neuronal infections at bay; therefore, their loss may contribute to viral reactivation.
 In addition to cytokine secretion, some T lymphocytes kill infected cells through perforinand/or granzyme-mediated mechanisms. Perforins, which are found in the lytic granules of CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, punch holes in the membrane of infected target cells, allowing for the delivery of granzymes that lead to lysis of the infected cell. Granzymes are serine proteases that induce caspase cleavage and activation of pro-apoptotic cellular proteins, such as BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID). This mode of T cell-mediated killing, which efficiently eliminates 'viral factories', has been primarily studied in rapidly dividing cells. Interestingly, in some neuronal infections, the secretion of granzymes does not lead to lysis but rather aids in preventing viral reactivation and replication while sparing the infected neuron 82 . In addition to their ability to kill cells, granzymes can directly cleave eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G3 (eIF4G3) (a cellular protein that is important for host and viral translation) and ICP4 (a herpesvirus-specific protein needed for the transcription of early and late viral genes) 82, 83 . By cleaving eIF4G3, granzymes block viral translation but fail to induce neuronal apoptosis, further preventing viral dissemination within the host and sparing the infected neuron. Cleavage of ICP4 by granzymes directly prevents reactivation of latent HSV from infected neurons. In these instances, granzymes are acting on proteins other than their traditional protein targets to induce an alternative neuronal response.
 It has also been speculated that viral RNAs and proteins can contribute to non-lytic outcomes. For instance, HSV latency-associated transcripts inhibit the action and expression of various caspase proteins, which are key mediators of the cell death process 84 . Nevertheless, in some cases, bystander immune-mediated neuronal death may occur. For example, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection of mice results in hippocampal neuron death through a mechanism that is dependent on inflammatory monocyte infiltration and activation 85 .
 The notable absence of B cells in the brain of virus-infected mice led to the misperception that B cells and the antibodies that they secrete play a minor part in viral control. In fact, numerous human CNS infections, including those caused by MV, PV, VZV, HSV and flaviviruses, are characterized by the presence of intrathecal antibodies in the CSF [86] [87] [88] . Humoral responses seem to be associated with protective rather than pathogenic functions, as observed for Japanese Encephalitis virus and some neurotropic retroviruses 86 . Antibodies may be particularly beneficial for those infections that result in extracellular infectious virus production.
 A central theme of this Review has been the notion that infected cells, such as neurons, respond to immune effectors in cell-specific ways. However, the existence of many subpopulations of neurons, which are segregated by location and function, raises the issue of whether responses may differ within these neuronal subsets. Recent studies showed that cerebellar granule neurons and cortical neurons pretreated with type I IFNs vary in their ability to control a WNV infection 89 . Type I IFN treatment had a much greater impact on the spread of infection in cerebellar granule neurons than it did in cortical neurons (100-fold versus 15-fold reduction), and this difference correlated with discrete patterns of ISG induction 89 . Animal model studies have also shown differences in the propensity for a virus to infect individual neuronal subpopulations and regions of the brain (FIG. 3) ; for example, the hippocampus is heavily infected by RABV, whereas MV is more often found in the midbrain [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] . Whether these distinctions can be attributed to differences in viral tropism or intrinsic variations in the neuronal response to soluble immune effector proteins (or, perhaps, to the way a virus gains access to the brain) is not known. Answering this question will require further studies that must necessarily integrate virology, immunology and neurobiology.
 Preservation of virus-challenged neurons from immune-mediated lysis seems to be advantageous to the host, but this leaves open the possibility of long-term viral maintenance in surviving neurons (TABLE 1) . Previously, many researchers believed that neurotropic RNA viruses were sterilely cleared from the CNS. Indeed, unlike DNA viruses or retroviruses that can establish latent infections through episome formation or integration, RNA viruses do not have known means to 'survive' within a host cell. This is especially relevant given the lability of RNA within the cytoplasm, which arises owing to the inherently unstable ribose subunit and the susceptibility of the 2′ hydroxyl group to deprotonation. On the other hand, RNA viral genomes are unlikely to persist in the cytoplasm as naked RNA. Ribonucleoprotein complexes would provide some protection, and viral RNAs (like other cellular RNAs) may also be sequestered in stress granules. Thus, mechanisms must exist to protect RNA viral genomes, allowing for their long-term stability in the cytoplasm.
 Do these long-term infections have pathogenic potential? A set of studies from the late 1980s showed that MV RNA can persist in human brains for decades after resolution of the peripheral infection without causing neurological symptoms [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] ; in these studies, organs from individuals who had died of non-viral, non-CNS-related causes were screened, and a high proportion of brain tissues were found to be MV RNA positive. In addition, some scientists have argued that MV entry into the human CNS may occur at a higher rate than previously thought 101 , although only a small fraction of acutely infected people will manifest neurological consequences. Accordingly, viral RNAs were generally considered 'fossils' that were unlikely to contribute to human disease. Surprisingly, autopsy studies performed on the brain of patients that succumbed to SSPE have shown regions of the brain with no detectable MV proteins, despite the presence of MV RNA, suggesting that RNA, even with its inherent instability, can be maintained in a translationally silent state 102 .
 The long-term persistence of viral RNA in the CNS is not unique to MV. For example, infection of mice with the MHV strain A59, which is used to model the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis, leads to encephalitis and hepatitis. The infectious virus is cleared from the liver and CNS in 20 days; however, the mice develop a progressive, immunemediated demyelinating disease 103 , and viral nucleic acid persists 104 . The potential importance of viral nucleic acid persistence in demyelination has been subordinated by the prevailing view that long-term disease is caused by an overactivation of the host response towards myelin proteins. Other neurotropic RNA viruses that are known to persist within the mouse brain (sometimes for periods longer than 1 year post exposure) in the absence of detectable antigen or infectious viral progeny include Sindbis virus, Sendai virus and RABV 95, 105, 106 . However, the lack of recoverable infectious virus does not preclude the possibility that these viruses are actively suppressed in the CNS, similar to the control of neuronal herpesvirus infections by T rm . Could decreases in the magnitude or quality of the host response (for example, with ageing or after immunosuppressive therapy) lead to loss of resident memory cells and reactivation of viral replication that are temporally separated from the initial infection?
 The short answer is that we do not yet know. However, it was recently shown that an endogenous retrovirus, which was integrated into the host genome millions of years ago, could contribute to human neurological disease. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurological disease of poorly understood aetiology that is characterized by consistent inflammatory response and immune-mediated pathogenesis. The expression of this human endogenous retrovirus, specifically the expression of the envelope protein, was proposed as a possible cause for the neuropathology that is seen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 107 .
 Limits of detection, reproducibility, consistency in the brain regions that are analysed and patient-to-patient variability all contribute to the challenges and dangers of ascribing neurotropic infections to be the aetiologic causes of poorly understood CNS diseases. Moreover, the association of 'new' viruses with CNS disease (including Zika virus, which is linked to microcephaly 108, 109 ) or the emergence of more neurovirulent influenza strains 110 are reminders that our understanding of the pathogenic consequences of CNS infections remain quite primitive. Translational studies have provided insights into the links between infections and disease but are not without controversy. For example, the prevalence of human cytomegalovirus in patients with glioblastoma has been hotly debated 111 , although anti-cytomegalovirus treatments lead to reduction in tumour burden in some patients 111 . Furthermore, losses in host immune status due to age or chemotherapy are well known to provoke disease, as observed with JC (John Cunningham) virus infection and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 112 .
 Whether CNS virus infections have a larger role in human diseases of unknown aetiology remains controversial. In support of this notion, CNS neurons may be an ideal harbour for long-term infections: non-lytic immune mechanisms spare neuronal loss while providing an avenue for a non-cytopathic virus to persist. Moreover, trans-synaptic spread is likely to enable viral escape from antibody recognition or phagocytosis by antigen-presenting cells. From an evolutionary perspective, neuronal survival is paramount; thus, sparing infected neurons a lytic fate may promote survival early on but could potentially open the door for viral reactivation later in life. We do not know if there are viruses that are typically found in CNS tissues of overtly healthy individuals; with the advent of the RNA sequencing technology, new RNA sequencing studies might shed light on the potential 'virome' within the brain of both asymptomatic individuals and people with neurological conditions. One final point that is worth noting concerns the utility of mouse models (on which many of the studies cited in this Review were based) to study human CNS diseases. Scientists often make the mistake of assuming that mouse survival is equivalent to an absence of disease. This may mean that the long-term ramifications of acute virus infections, especially those of RNA viruses that are not generally considered to be lifelong, may be overlooked. However, we are increasingly becoming aware that the presence of viral fragments or latent viruses that can reactivate might evoke non-lethal pathogenic consequences resulting from either viral replication and cell damage or immune responses directed against viral antigens. Such pathogenic consequences, as seen with the learning defects in LCMV-infected mice, may be subtle. Consequently, the parallel development of more-precise approaches to assess CNS disease in mice, including tools to evaluate the impacts on learning, behaviour and memory, should refine how we describe neuropathogenesis in the many valuable mouse models that are currently in use. Finally, determining whether or not persistent viral nucleic acids detected within the brain are replication competent and how these viruses evade complete clearance could promote the development of novel antiviral therapies to treat or prevent devastating and prevalent human neurological and neurodegenerative diseases 95, 113 .

 Viruses gain entry into permissive cells through an interaction between virally encoded glycoproteins, which are expressed on the outer surface of the virus particle, and cellular receptors. Entry can be achieved through endocytosis into vesicles or via membrane fusion 114 . For fusogenic viruses, exit from the cell occurs either via budding of virus particles through the plasma membrane or via fusion of an infected cell with an adjacent, uninfected cell 114 . The latter process results in the formation of multinucleated cells, or syncytia. The formation of syncytia may support further viral production but irrevocably leads to the death of the fused cells. Similarly, release of infectious particles by budding often leads to the death of the infected cell 115 .
 However, viruses that are considered cytopathic in renewable cell types -including measles virus (MV), rabies virus and pseudorabies virus -can switch to a nonproductive, non-syncytia-forming mode of spread when infecting neurons, promoting neuronal survival 12, 19, 20, 116, 117 . Often, this is correlated with absence of detectable extracellular viral particles. The spread of these viruses within neurons is primarily transsynaptic, although the neuronal processes that enable a switch from viral budding and syncytia formation to non-cytolytic, trans-synaptic spread are not yet defined.
 At least two possibilities might explain the viral movement across the synapse. In the first scenario, the spread of viral particles between neurons requires ligand-receptor interactions, similar to infection in non-neuronal cells. Directed transport to the synapse and focal fusion at the synaptic cleft might be required for a virus to migrate across the synapse: thus, the process that occurs in non-neuronal cells might also be operative in neurons. Trans-synaptic spread might require the same cellular and viral proteins that allow for fusion of non-neuronal cells or may be unique to the presynaptic-postsynaptic interface. For example, in MV neuronal infection, expression of the primary receptors that are used in non-neuronal cell infection is not required; however, a fusion event is still necessary for the spread to occur, perhaps, by forming a 'pore' through which the viral ribonucleic acid is transported 118 .
 In the second scenario, the close approximation between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane, coupled with the unique attributes of the synaptic junction, may allow for the passive transport of viruses that have trafficked or assembled there. The release of neurotransmitters and uptake of their receptors make the synaptic interface particularly fluid, which might make it uniquely able to support receptor-independent trafficking.
 Three modes of viral entry into the brain are shown. a | Viruses may directly infect the cells comprising the blood-brain barrier (BBB), followed by release into the parenchymal space (left panel). Alternatively, viruses may diffuse across permeable regions of the BBB (middle panel). Of note, BBB permeability can be influenced by cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and various interferons (IFNβ, IFNγ and IFNλ), which can loosen or reinforce the barrier integrity. In the 'Trojan horse' approach (right panel), infected lymphocytes or monocytes (including macrophages) traffic across the BBB or blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, releasing the virus once in the brain parenchyma. b | Trans-synaptic spread of viral particles involves the transport of viral genomes and associated proteins via microtubules and molecular motors. The left panel shows the movement of rabies virus (RABV) from the muscle, across the neuromuscular junction, and the dynein-mediated retrograde transport of this virus into the CNS. In the right panel, the transport of viruses (including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV)) occurs across the epithelial or endothelial-neuron junction. In these neurons, retrograde transport brings the virus to the neuronal soma, and anterograde transport delivers the virus to the peripheral nervous system (PNS)-CNS synaptic junction.

Part a is adapted with permission from REF. 9 , PLoS. Part b is adapted with permission from REF. 4 , Elsevier. In cells with abundant levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signalling proteins, engagement of the interferon-γ (IFNγ) receptor (IFNGR) by its ligand transduces a primarily STAT1-driven cellular response, leading to activation of gene products that are chiefly antiviral (part a). By contrast, when a particular cell population (such as hippocampal neurons) expresses reduced homeostatic levels of STAT1 (part b) or when STAT1 is removed by genetic deletion (part c), alternative signalling molecules with an affinity to the IFNGR may bind to this receptor, transducing unique cellular responses. In the case of neurons, this includes activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), which then can result in the induction of genes encoding pro-survival proteins.

Viruses have been studied for more than 100 years, and more than 5,000 types of viruses have been discovered and described. Most viruses are made up of coat protein subunits that naturally self-assemble into truly monodisperse particles. With more understanding of the coat protein building blocks and chemical biology, ever increasing complex assemblies can be programmed, including nanoboomerang-and tetrapod-shaped virus materials. 15 Large-scale production of viruses can be easily achieved through propagation in their natural hosts or expression in a heterologous system (see Section 2.2). Additionally, these particles come in a variety of shapes and sizes 16, 17 that can function as nanoscaffolds that can be easily and reproducibly modified 18 . 17, 19 While there is the biotechnology arm where we seek to engineer particles for applications in medicine and energy, there is also a basic arm that investigates virus assembly and structure. These two arms of research are interconnected, with crosstalk between the two fields providing insights for advancement. 21, 22 Through multidisciplinary collaboration, the use of viral scaffolds as unique materials for diverse applications can be realized. Classical virology taxonomy utilizes the Baltimore classification of viruses, in which the viruses are grouped both according to their genomes as well as their method of replication. Mammalian viruses, such as adenovirus (class I -dsDNA virus) and adeno-associated virus (AAV, class II -ssDNA virus), do offer many advantages for applications in gene therapy, in which they can be administered to make modifications to the genetic sequence for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes (see Section 4.1.4). Nevertheless, bacteriophage-and plant virus-derived materials may offer advantages, as their manufacture is scalable through fermentation and molecular farming. Additionally, these materials are not infectious toward mammals, adding another layer of safety. Both these factors are important considerations as we move toward clinical applications and commercialization. For icosahedral viruses, the triangulation number, or T number, is one method of classification that gives an indication as to their size (see Figure 1 ). The T number was first described by Donald Caspar and Aaron Klug in 1962. 25 By multiplying by 60, it can be used to determine the number of coat proteins in a capsid. For example, a T = 1 virus has 60 coat proteins, while a T = 4 virus has 240 coat proteins. For example, icosahedrons have the advantage of possessing an interior cavity that can be used for the infusion and encapsulation of various payloads. On the other hand, high aspect ratio particles can be used to form wires, which can then be applied for energy applications. Overall, it is clear that there is a diverse library of virus particles to select from, no matter the application. 33] [34] [35] These methods include treatment with heavy metals such as lead acetate, 33 incubation in alkaline conditions for RNA hydrolysis, 34 and induction of osmotic shock using a high molarity sodium sulfate solution. 56 These bacteria transfer part of their tumor inducing plasmid into the plant cell, which can be exploited for transient expression of genes of interest. 57 Replication of intact VNPs such as BMV has been demonstrated. 58 Additionally, viral capsids of CPMV completely devoid of RNA (either virus or host) can be produced in this way. 60 This approach has been proven to produce high yields of recombinant proteins and can be applied in a high throughput manner, making it an attractive option for VLP expression. Some early work in this area utilized a eukaryotic system based on rabbit reticulocyte to study capsid assembly of hepatitis C virus (HCV), HBV, and three primate lentiviruses, but the yields were quite low (~10 ng/ μL). 63 Additionally, Qβ VLPs were able to be formed using this system through coproduction of its coat protein with a cytotoxic A2 protein that is normally naturally incorporated on the exterior of the capsid to facilitate infection, demonstrating the advantage of a cell-free system for cytotoxic protein production and regulating the relative expression of multiple proteins. Among the most frequently used of these that we will discuss are genetic engineering, bioconjugation, infusion, biomineralization, and self-assembly ( Figure 3) . As engineering capabilities improve, even greater diversities of virus-based and virus-like particles can be created, expanding the possible applications of these materials. The coat proteins of VNPs are determined by their genetic code. Nucleic acid sequences of viruses are relatively small, and therefore many of their genomes have been sequenced and are well characterized. 66] [67] [68] [69] [70] Insertion of unnatural amino acids is also possible, allowing for more diverse chemical modifications. 71, 72 Additionally, removal of residues can be accomplished such that only a single unique reactive site remains on the coat protein. 87 In this particular example, assembly of particles displaying the proteins can then be achieved by means of an intermediary antibody specific to the viral coat protein. Some alternatives to these natural amino acids include replacing methionine residues with homopropargyl glycine (HPG) or azidohomoalanine (AHA) residues to add alkyne or azide functionalities, respectively. 71 Another interesting method utilizes mutant tRNA synthetases to attach unnatural amino acids to amber suppressor tRNAs for incorporation of these amino acids at amber stop codon sites. p-azidophenylalanine and pAF are particularly noteworthy due to providing azide and amine groups, respectively, for selective coupling reactions. As can be noted, incorporation of azide and alkyne groups is an especially widespread strategy. 92] [93] [94] [95] [96] Reaction without copper catalysis can also be achieved by utilizing cyclooctyne derivatives, which lower the activation barrier due to the ring strain. 97 Additional reaction handles that have been utilized include aldehydes and ketones for hydrazone or oxime condensation reactions. 101 The formed ketone or an aldehyde group can then be used to form stable oxime linkages with alkoxyamines. 108 In a similar manner, charge-transfer interactions between electron donors and acceptors can also be used for derivatization of viral scaffolds. As an illustration, attachment of pyrene molecules allowed for particle functionalization through interaction with electron-deficient dinitrophenyl and pyridinium motifs. Viruses are generally flexible and contain pores that allow for diffusion of small molecules, such as drugs and contrast agents, into and out of the capsid. Examples of infusion for imaging and drug delivery are described in Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.5. 123 Native packaging mechanisms can also be utilized, which was demonstrated with adding oligonucleotides mimicking the origin of assembly for RCNMV's packaging of its RNA on various nanoparticles to induce particle formation around the different cargo. 128 While VLPs consisting of 90 coat protein dimers were formed under normal pH-induced self-assembly conditions, when the NaCl concentration was increased to lower the ELP transition temperature, the ELP-induced assembly resulted in the formation of smaller particles consisting of 30 coat protein dimers. 130 Introducing histidine tags that have affinity for Ni-NTA is another method. These design parameters affect their circulation in the body as well as their cellular interactions and tissue specificity. Some general principles have been established specifically for virus-based particles, 136 and we will highlight some of the lessons here. 143 A more recent study reported a negative zeta potential for PVX, 144 likely due to different buffer conditions used, which indicates further investigation into the charge of PVX under in vivo conditions is crucial for confirming whether or not it defies convention. 148, 149 Shape is a difficult parameter to account for due to the challenge of producing monodisperse particles that can be precisely and reproducibly tailored at the nanoscale, but this challenge can be surmounted using VNPs and VLPs due to the specificity of their self-assembly process. 143 Some possible reasons to account for this include a thinner cross-section and greater flexibility for PVX compared to TMV. PEG is the standard polymer used to reduce immunogenicity and nonspecific cell interactions. 151 Surface PEGylation has been applied to many VNPs and has been established as a broadly applicable method for extending circulation time. 102, 138, 152, 153 Additionally, differences in the route of clearance was also observed, with non-PEGylated TMV and PVX filaments getting filtered through the kidneys, while PEGylated particles do not, likely due to the increase in the width of the particles after conjugation preventing renal filtration. Despite a smaller predicted radius, branched PEG with multiple sites of attachment to the particle has been shown to be more effective at shielding than linear PEG four times its molecular weight, likely because simultaneous tethering of the ends of the PEG traps it closer to the particle, reducing its movement and the possibility of nonspecific protein adsorption. To obtain the most favorable ligand display density, there is a balance between increasing avidity and reducing cellular receptor depletion that arises from increased ligand density. For example, the inclusion of PEG can assist in increasing circulation time and avoiding nonspecificity as discussed above. have been used for tissue-specific imaging and delivery of contrast agents in applications of optical imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). In addition, clearance and removal from the body are critical for preventing toxicity from tissue retention of contrast agents, and many VNP platforms tend to be cleared quickly from the body (half-life of minutes) [137] [138] [139] 154 compared to some synthetic materials that require months for clearance, such as carbon nanotubes, gold, and silica. [ With improvements in imaging technology, earlier disease detection and better prognosis can be realized. The ability to track particles further aids in the evaluation of drug delivery platforms, as it can be used for confirmation of cell-specific uptake and investigation of interactions of particles within the body, such as their clearance, biodistribution, and immunogenicity. 21, 130 Fluorescence is useful for quantification of particle uptake using flow cytometry, visualization of particle localization through confocal microscopy, and determination of biodistribution using in vivo imaging. Therefore, a fairly low density of around 10% is more ideal for achieving optimal fluorescence intensity. 173 As advancements are made, another aspect that could be explored is the integration of gold nanoparticles with fluorophores for metal-enhanced fluorescence with improved quantum yields and decreased photobleaching. 84, 143 As discussed in the previous section, evaluation of localization of particles inside the tumor revealed enhanced accumulation and penetration of rod-shaped particles. CPMV in particular exhibits unique specificity in interacting with surface vimentin, which is found on endothelial, cancer, and inflammatory cells. [ 181 Specificity can also be introduced through the incorporation of targeting ligands for molecular imaging. 161 These studies all evaluated cell binding in vitro and there are some promising results indicating partitioning of targeted particles to tumor cells compared to macrophages in co-cultures, 161 and it would be of interest to see their development in mouse models. 148 Beyond such strategies, matrix and secreted proteins are also advantageous targets. 148 The high contrast can be attributed to the high payload of 1200 Gd/TMV, the slower molecular tumbling rate resulting from attachment of Gd(DOTA) to the macromolecule, inclusion of the targeting peptide, and the advantage imparted by the shape of TMV for drifting laterally to the vessel wall. While fairly high and much greater than 20 mM −1 s −1 for Gd alone, these values do not approach the measurement of around 28,000 mM −1 s −1 per particle from the initial study with direct attachment of Gd. 193 To improve contrast, interior and exterior labeling 196, 197 as well as rigidity of linkers 198 was explored with MS2 using chelators based on hydroxypyridinonate (HOPO) due to its 3-fold relaxivity enhancement compared to clinically used Magnevist, or Gd(DTPA). 202 It is expected that a combination of these research directions investigating chelators, linkers, conjugation, shape shifting, and coating will result in particles with even greater contrast for better visualization of disease. Apart from Gd-based contrast enhancement, manganese and iron oxide are other contrast agents that have been investigated. 204 Encapsulation of iron oxide nanoparticles and phantom imaging has been demonstrated with hepatitis B core VLPs. 205 Another MR contrast approach that is quite new is chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and hyperCEST imaging. Xenon-based agents in particular have been explored for viruses. 208 Due to the more than 10,000-fold increase in sensitivity, there is a lot of potential in this new technology. PET imaging is another sensitive imaging modality and relies on the detection of radiotracers. 211 Targeting ligands were also explored in conjunction with PET imaging, with RGD for targeting human sarcoma 212 and glioma 213 xenografts and GE11 for targeting an EGFR positive liver cancer xenograft model. 157 In the context of virus-based particles, there has been less work with PET compared to the other imaging modalities. Since the field is enormous, we would like to feature just some of the research on vaccination, focusing on a few studies in the areas of infectious disease, brain disorders, and cancer. For a more comprehensive overview of virus-based particles for vaccines, the reader is invited to consult further reviews. As an example, a recent investigation studied the effect of presentation of the particularly conserved membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of HIV-1 gp41 on VLPs, and the approach produced anti-MPER antibodies that showed neutralizing activity in a rabbit model. Aside from vaccines for human viral infections, it is of great interest to investigate animal vaccines as well for the protection of pets and livestock. An early study inserted a short epitope from the VP2 capsid protein of mink enteris virus (MEV) within the capsid of CPMV and found that it imparted protective immunity against clinical disease in mink, with a dose of 1 mg not only offering complete protection but also reducing shedding of the virus. The development of vaccines in plant-based systems could result in cheap, easily scalable production without the danger of animal pathogen contamination. 233 Further, Phase I trials found that this approach was safe and well tolerated, with high antibody production against nicotine in all individuals. Recently, Merck brought Gardasil 9 to market, an HPV vaccine upgrade from Gardasil that protects against 9 serotypes of HPV that account for 90% of HPV-related cancers. 237 While this is fantastic news, alternatives are necessary due to issues with cost and distribution in the developing world. Commercial vaccines are VLPs derived from the L1 major capsid protein of HPV, which is not conserved across serotypes. Thus, a simpler approach that can be more broadly protective would be more ideal. HER2 is a receptor overexpressed on breast cancers that tend to be more aggressive and is one potential target for cancer immunotherapy. Presentation of P4 378-394 , a B-cell epitope from the extracellular domain of HER2, on PVX led to higher antibody titers that were specific to HER2 compared to soluble P4 peptide alone. Therefore, this is a potential approach for a potent prophylactic vaccine against HER2 cancer. Evaluation of Tn presentation for in vivo cancer protection will be an essential next step for carrying this forward as a cancer vaccine therapeutic. eCPMV was found to specifically target and activate neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment, leading to a strong and rapid anti-tumor response. The potential of VLPs for vaccines and immunotherapies is quite evident, with opportunities for the treatment of not only infectious diseases but also addiction, brain disorders, cancer, and more. 253 Based on lack of serious adverse events from initial studies and positive phase III trial results, they are expected to advance toward filing a Biologics License Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 255 Despite these misfortunate and discouraging results in the past, more research has led to a better understanding of gene delivery, its potential pitfalls, and how to overcome them, leading to a lot more control over accomplishing the purpose of gene delivery with less severe and fewer adverse effects. 256] [257] [258] However, we will take a glimpse at a few studies to demonstrate the breadth of the field and the exciting studies being performed. Adenovirus is an icosahedral non-enveloped virus with a core diameter of 90 nm and fibers that extend from its penton bases, which allow attachment to the host cell through the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) (see Figure 1 ). 260 This tactic works by injecting adenovirus containing cDNA for herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) around the lesion after surgical resection of the tumor. 263 AAV vectors can additionally provide protection from simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). 271 As an improvement to simple PEG coatings, complexation with copolymers of PEG and PEI resulted in the ability to transduce CAR-negative NIH 3T3 cells, with the added benefit of less toxicity compared to PEI alone. 272 Aside from PEI, cationic poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers can also be used for enhancing gene delivery. 275 Gene delivery with plant viruses is only beginning to take shape and has recently been demonstrated through assembly of CCMV coat proteins around heterologous RNA derived from Sindbis virus (SINV), which was shown to be released into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells through co-delivery of Lipofectamine-2000 ( Figure  11 ). 276 For gene silencing, MS2 phage has been especially popular for packaging of RNA. Photothermal therapy is an area whose potential has barely been tapped in the virus realm. Using such an approach, treatment can be applied to a specific area and toxicity elsewhere is reduced. 280 Other studies since then have also been successful in attaching gold to VNPs, 281, 282 but photothermal therapy using these formulations has yet to be explored. 286 To move toward clinical application of PDT, use of photosensizers that can be excited in the NIR range would be more ideal for better tissue penetration. Chemotherapy is associated with dose-limiting toxicities, and specific delivery to cancer cells using carrier systems increases safety as well as targeted payload delivery. 290 Dox works through intercalating into DNA and causing oxidative DNA damage. 184 As another example, CPMV was used for treatment of HeLa cells through the display of Dox attached either by a direct covalent bond or through a disulfide linker. Virus-based platforms have also been explored for the co-delivery of therapies. However, different targeting strategies were used, making it difficult to draw conclusions as to the relative efficacy of the two drugs. This is likely due to better transport of the drug to the tumor cells with the nanocarrier. 305 Research then moved toward the use of filamentous viruses, as they better mimic the structure of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Coating of TMV with different cell binding motifs derived from integrin binding matrix proteins collagen and fibronectin onto a high binding plate demonstrated that the peptide sequence displayed plays a role in cell adhesion and morphology. 310 Investigation of the ECM deposited by cells cultured on these films revealed correlation between cellular alignment and the orientation of fibronectin and collagen I deposition. 311 NIH-3T3 fibroblasts produced more ECM proteins, which resulted in more of a tendency to deviate from the original patterning, and thus the fibroblasts displayed reduced alignment over time as well as when compared with less ECM-producing BHK cells. An application of phage nanofiber formation is the growth and differentiation of neural cells. 323 Osteocalcin gene expression and onset of mineralization were found 7 days earlier for cells grown on TYMV-coated substrates compared to tissue culture plastic when cultured in osteogenic media, indicating the nanotopology imparted by the TYMV supports osteogenic differentiation. 325 Additional conjugation of phosphate groups to the exterior of TMV further boosted differentiation by aiding in the incorporation of calcium and consequently highly enriched mineralization of the ECM. 330 Display of DGEA peptide derived from collagen. 83 3D printed scaffolds composed of hydroxyapatite and β-tricalcium phosphate is another approach, and introduction of M13-RGD combined with chitosan within the scaffold pore not only led to osteogenesis but also angiogenesis, with inclusion of VEGF further enhancing the effect (Figure 13) . The display of foreign sequences on filamentous phages was first described by George Smith in 1985. Many reviews have been written that delve into the depths of phage display technology. [ The general structure of filamentous phages is shown in Figure  14 , 344 which illustrates how the phages are comprised of a number of minor and major coat proteins. 365 Enzymes and their substrates can also be displayed on phages, either independently or together on a single particle, in order to screen for functional enzyme catalysts. 376 In vivo phage display is particularly noteworthy and lends itself to many different applications. For example, peptides targeting specific organs can be examined using in vivo screening of random peptides in a mouse model. Furthermore, attachment of brain targeting peptides to fixed red blood cells resulted in the accumulation of the cells in the brain at a greater extent than the kidneys. 384 For an alternative to the presentation of peptides on viruses, antibodies can also be presented on the viral scaffold for multivalent detection, and the previous section discussed how phage display and genetic engineering could be used for the display of antibodies and fragments thereof. As another approach, it was recently demonstrated that functionalization of PVX-based nanoparticles with protein A fragments can be used to display whole antibody molecules by using protein A's property of binding to the Fc region of the heavy chain of IgGs. Another aspect of ELISAs is the enzyme used for quantification via substrate conversion. HRP is a popular enzyme for ELISAs due to its ability to convert chromogenic substrates into colored products and chemiluminescent substrates into fluorescent products. 390 By additionally coupling NeutrAvidin to the capsid, the CPMV could be used as a detection reagent. Optical sensors also encompass those that utilize SPR for detection. SPR has also been applied as sensors for immunoassays, such as exemplified by the detection of the food-borne bacterium Listeria monocytogenes using a gold SPR sensor chip. 393 M13 displaying an scFv antibody recognizing L. monocytogenes cells was immobilized on the sensor chip before injection of samples for measurement. 395 Besides optical sensing, viruses have also found application in electrochemical sensing. The differential current was proportional to TNT concentration and therefore could be used for TNT sensing. Detection using this method is not limited to just TNT and can be expanded to other relatively small electroactive species. sensing approach, which is widely applied for disease diagnostics, involves using assays that detect and amplify the nucleic acid content of infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses. [ If so desired, the RNA within these particles can be subsequently released through heating at 70°C for 5 minutes. 413 Several developments in the technology have been made to enhance the utility of Armored RNA. 414 The standard strategy for RNA encapsulation within MS2 is limited to only around 2 kb, but increasing the packaging efficiency to overcome this limit can be achieved through incorporating more translational repressor stem-loops within the RNA, which specifically interact with the MS2 capsid and trigger the self-assembly of the viral shell around the cargo. 414 HCV Armored RNA has also been developed for RT-PCR and bDNA assays, and additional work demonstrated its applicability in genotyping assays as well, allowing the distinction of a specific subtype of HCV. 405, 416 Beyond controls for the detection of single virus types, Armored RNA chimeras have also been created. 420 The resultant controls were resistant to nuclease degradation and performed similarly to the native virus in PCR assays, with very similar growth curves observed. Furthermore, the constructs remained stable at both 37°C and 45°C when diluted in human plasma for periods of at least 4 weeks. Encapsulated controls are not only limited to bacteriophages. 422 To produce these particles, a cDNA clone was engineered to contain sequences for the desired control RNA alongside RNA-2 of CPMV, which codes for its coat and movement proteins. The particles performed well as positive controls for the detection of both FMDV and SVDV. Additionally, they were resistant to RNase and performed reliably even after 33 days storage in a 10% suspension of bovine epithelium at room temperature. This method may provide a low cost alternative to Armored RNA, while maintaining the advantages of stability and rapid production. This approach was recently demonstrated for RT-PCR detection of EBOV. Aside from the EBOV primer binding sites, the EBOV sequence was scrambled, therefore posing no threat of infection. Through disassembly and reassembly of the capsid, HRP was encapsulated within CCMV, resulting in an estimated one in every 130 capsids containing the enzyme and allowing study of the enzyme at a single-molecule level. Encapsulated PalB had a higher activity compared to non-encapsulated PalB, which was hypothesized to be due to a higher enzyme concentration when considering just the capsid alone. Additionally, there was no effect on the reaction velocity when varying the number of encapsulated enzymes between one and four PalB per capsid, which is likely due the presence of generally only one substrate molecule per capsid, making more than one enzyme unnecessary for substrate conversion. Tethered encapsulation was also explored using RNA aptamers. There is a range of other applications to consider for nanoreactors, many of which have been demonstrated using P22 viral scaffolds. For example, it was determined that the immobilization of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inside P22 could be used for its stabilization and delivery to human cervix carcinoma cells with retention of substrate conversion activity, which could be further exploited for enzymatic prodrug therapies. With the scalable production of encapsulated hydrogenase through simple fermentation, cheap and sustainable clean fuel production can be realized. Therefore, enzyme assemblies are of import in facilitating the construction of complex metabolic systems. In such a manner, the abamectin cargo is protected against oxidation and can be released over time. Plants, as used by Medicago Inc. and Mapp Biopharmaceutical, are not as well known for the expression of recombinant proteins as the more widely used E. coli and yeast expression systems, so we will focus on some examples of plant-based production systems in this section to illustrate some of their advantages. 436, 437 Due to these advantages in cost and production, plant systems offer the potential for rapid pharmaceutical development, especially for more impoverished areas. Further research of such N. benthamianabased expression systems found that suppression of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), the plant's adaptive immune system, resulted in enhanced efficiency and was possible through co-expression of the P19 protein of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV). 440 Furthermore, through ""magnifection,"" or weak vacuum infiltration of the plants immersed in the Agrobacterium suspension, transfection at a large scale can be quickly achieved without the need of the CP gene or the wait for systemic plant movement. 451 Similar expression systems have been derived from plasmids based on PVX and other potexviruses. 455 Deconstructed vectors have also been used for PVX-based expression systems. 458 This technology involves using a transgenic TEV-B tobacco line that expresses the suppressor gene that is then infected with a PVX amplicon containing the gene of interest. 459 On the other hand, the FoMV-based FECT vector series utilized deconstructed plasmids in which the CP and TGB were deleted and required co-expression of the P19 suppressor of PTGS. 230 CPMV is a bipartite virus with RNA-1 providing replication and protein processing capabilities and RNA-2 coding for movement and coat proteins. In such a manner more complex VLPs such as BTV VLPs consisting of up to four different proteins can be assembled. Binding of Rep to a site within the LIR initiates rolling circle replication of the replicon system. As a final example, pRIC is a similar BeYDV-derived autonomously replicating vector 472 that presented an advancement to a previous high expressing but non-replicating pTRAc cassette. Although MagnICON has been used widely in the past, its utilization of multiple modules likely detracts from its efficiency, and the development of other systems using single constructs may lead to greater popularity. The design and development of devices with nanoscale features open the door for novel and more efficient ways to capture, store, and transfer energy. Since viruses are self-assembled from coat proteins into nanoscale structures, and the protein-based building blocks also show an inherent propensity to self-assemble into higher-order hierarchical assemblies, 124, [474] [475] [476] [477] [478] [479] they provide an ideal building scaffold for the design of nanostructured materials. Examples are highlighted in the following sections of the functionalization of virus-based materials to yield energy-relevant materials such as light harvesting systems, plasmonic metamaterials, and energy and data storage systems. hurdle to the production of mesoscale nanostructured materials is the availability of high-precision manufacturing technologies that facilitate large-scale assembly while also providing spatial control at the 1-100 nanometer level. 489] [490] [491] [492] [493] [494] [495] [496] [497] [498] [499] Chemical programming of hierarchical structures has also been devised, as seen in the synthesis of branched dendrimer systems. [ For instance, TMV building blocks can be specifically directed to assemble endto-end (or head-to-tail) or side-to-side when exposed to appropriate bathing conditions. 478 By additionally incorporating DNA hybridization, progress has also been made toward greater control in the specific ordering of viral particles when assembled end-to-end. 477, 519 For example, M13 phage-based liquid crystals present a nematic phase at low concentrations. As the concentration increases, a cholesteric liquid crystalline phase is observed. 13, 520, 521 Ordering can also be achieved at liquid/liquid and liquid/solid interfaces. 522, 523 Another possibility for the formation of assemblies of high aspect ratio viruses is through mixtures with spheres; the increased free energy at the interface favors the assembly of uniform structures. Addition of divalent metal cations has also been shown to induce the formation of ordered aggregates of TMV. 526 Furthermore, highly ordered, optically birefringent films were formed when the aggregates were dried on a glass surface. While beneficial for liquid crystal applications, this behavior poses an important consideration when formation of well-dispersed biomineralized TMV is desired in the formation of hybrid materials. 333, 529 For example, varied chiral liquid crystalline M13 phage films were obtained with the use of dip coating methods. Another potential area of application lies in colorimetric sensing. Other methods for VNP immobilization onto a surface have utilized DNA hybridization, a powerful technique proven for effective guided assembly of materials in 3D space. [ As an alternative nucleic acid-based method, RNA templates containing the TMV OAS can be patterned onto surfaces, giving a cue for the in situ formation of TMV arrays from the surface up when purified TMV coat proteins are added. 546 Toward the programming of binary materials and photonic crystals, the organization of compact structures of Qβ phage and gold nanoparticles through DNA interconnectors was reported, and the binary lattice was shown to form a NaTl lattice structure that contained interpenetrating organic and inorganic diamond lattices. As discussed and illustrated in earlier sections, viruses offer a framework for ligand and peptide display. To achieve digital memory, virus hybrids can be created such that they exhibit conductance switching behavior. Research has been performed for the creation of both cathodes and anodes based on M13 as well as TMV templates. 510, 556, 557, [565] [566] [567] [568] Using self-assembly of the viruses, fabrication of high performing small battery electrodes was made possible. 510, 565 Additional hybridization of the nanowires with Ni nanoparticles was found to enhance efficiency and cycle life. 566 On the other hand, TMV electrode development utilized its ability to assemble vertically on a substrate to form ""nanoforests"" with high surface area and room to accommodate for volume expansion. An additional M13-templated electrode example that is of note is one that utilized iridium oxide as the anodic material. 511 IrO 2 is exciting because it is an electrochromic material, which experiences color change through electrical potential application, a useful property for paper-like display devices. Porous electrodes made of these nanowires exhibited remarkable switching times of 35 ms for oxidation/coloration and 25 ms for reduction/bleaching, which is promising for applications requiring fast electrochromics. 559 M13 also served as a viral template to facilitated the nucleation of bismuth oxyfluoride, a conversion reaction cathode material, to form graphene/bismuth oxyfluoride nanocomposites that could be used as a conducting framework for energy storage with improved electron transfer kinetics. The excitation energy gets transferred in a cascade from donors to acceptors when the energy levels of absorption and emission match. 571 Synthetic light harvesting systems are of great interest in basic energy science and technology development for implementation in solar panels and other photovoltaic devices. Like photosynthetic machinery, viral capsids provide a means to precisely position chromophores with spatial control at the sub-nanometer level. 574 A very recent study has revealed groundbreaking work that further enhances the efficiency of energy transport in light harvesting devices. Genetic engineering of M13 was utilized to regulate the distances between chromophore binding sites to be either around 33 Å for the ""Classical Förster"" clone or 10 Å for the ""Super-Förster"" clone, a distance short enough for increased coupling strength but not too short to experience complete quenching. 576 As another part of the light harvesting process, filamentous viruses have also been employed for electron harvesting as nanowire-based photoanodes due to their ability to form porous networks with high surface area. 560, [577] [578] [579] The design of DSSCs involves the presence of a dye or photosensitizer for light absorption that, when excited, transfers the energy into the conduction band of a TiO 2 photoanode, where it then diffuses to a current collector such as fluorine-doped tin oxide. 591 Alternatively, the plasmonic nanostructures also have applications in a therapeutic context due to the transformation of the absorbed light into heat, 592, 593 which could be applied for the thermal ablation of tumors or the controlled release of drugs. 594, 595 Use as ""theranostic"" reagents, where diagnostic imaging and therapeutic functions are merged, presents another option. 599] [600] [601] In the reverse configuration (internal fluorophores and gold nanoparticle antennas), fluorescence enhancement was also observed, and it was found to be a function of nanoparticle size and the separation between the plasmon and gain material. 602 Some interesting electromagnetic effects can only be generated through well-structured ordering of plasmonic materials, a property that viruses can provide. For many diseases, there is still much to tackle to improve the effectiveness of their diagnosis and treatment. It will not be long before the widespread adoption of newer technology such as these follows. Finally, it should be abundantly clear that viruses present a great opportunity in the manufacture of energy-relevant materials. Along with their ability to self-assemble into ordered arrays, viruses offer the possibility for precise positioning at the nanoscale, a distinct advantage that can reveal novel material properties such as enhancements in plasmonic behavior. Deeper understanding of virus structure and assembly, in combination with new approaches in synthetic virology, will yield ever more complex formulations that will enable new functions. It remains exciting at the viruschemistry interface! Simplified illustrations show common methods for interior and exterior virus modification. With available exposed residues, bioconjugate chemistries can be performed. Interactions of metal precursors with the capsid can be used to selectively direct mineralization on the interior or exterior surface. Leaves were also imaged under UV light (bottom).

44,44,67f3f210d910f661cdff26d34d2973f6d0e8245e,,Altered Jejunal Permeability to Macromolecules During Viral Enteritis in the Piglet,"We studied the macromolecular permeability of segments of jejunum from 2-wk-old piglets after the animals had been experimentally infected with an invasive enteric virus , transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Jejunal segments were mounted in Ussing chambers at stages of the infection, and permeability was measured using three probe molecules of differing molecular weights. In control tissue, permeability to horseradish peroxidase was 2.6 times higher across segments with Peyer's patches than across segments without Peyer's patches, whereas polyethylene glycol 4000 and mannitol permeabilities were the same in patch and nonpatch segments. Twelve hours after infection, when virus had invaded the mucosa causing a structural lesion, and before diarrhea had begun, horseradish peroxidase permeability increased in non-patch-containing segments to equal that across patch-containing tissue. At this early 12-h stage, polyethylene glycol 4000 and mannitol permeation were unchanged in patchcontaining segments compared with controls. Ninety-six hours after transmissible gastroenteritis infection, when diarrhea was severe, horseradish peroxidase permeability in patch-free segments had","returned to normal and patch-containing tissue permeability was diminished below control levels. Increased macromolecular permeability appears to occur only in the very early invasive stage of this viral enteritis and only in patch-free segments. Any consideration of the immunologic relevance of these complex phenomena must take into account the specialized function of the Peyer's patch regions of the small intestine.
 The small intestine, particularly its Peyer's patch region, is capable of assimilating antigenically significant amounts of macromolecules (1, 2) . This study was designed to determine whether normal patterns of macromolecular absorption are distorted by mucosal disease. We studied piglets experimentally infected with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus, an invasive enteric corona virus that causes an acute self-limited diarrheal illness closely resembling human rotavirus enteritis in infants (3) (4) (5) (6) . We measured mucosa-to-serosa permeation rates of three m0lecules of widely differing weight across jejunum from piglets with TGE and from matched controls using an in vitro technique previously used in our laboratory to compare patch-containing with patch-free segments (2) .
 We measured mucosa-to-serosa permeation rates of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), 40,000 mol wt; polyethylene glycol (PEG), 4000 mol wt; and mannitol, 182 mol wt across stripped piglet jejunal mucosal segments, mounted in Ussing chambers and studied under zero transport conditions.
 Conventional York Landrace piglets, obtained at 14 days Abbreviations used in this paper: HRP, horseradish peroxidase; TGE, transmissible gastroenteritis. of age from a local herd known to be free of TGE and weaned to an evaporated cow milk formula for 3-5 days, were studied after infection with a standard oral dose of Purdue strain of TGE virus, and the findings were compared with those from uninfected matched controls (3) . All TGE-infected animals were housed in an isolation unit and studied either 12 h (5 piglets) or 96 h (6 piglets) after they were inoculated with virus. The 12-h interval was selected to coincide with the time at which TGE virus is known to invade the upper small intestinal mucosa (4) . At 96 h, our own studies (6) and others in the literature (4) demonstrate that diarrhea is well established but that the viruscladen epithelial cells have been shed into the lumen. In the present experiments, the piglets consistently developed vomiting and anorexia within 12 h of receiving TGE virus; diarrhea began within 24 h and peaked between 40 and 96 h.
 For the macromolecular permeation studies, the animals were killed after an overnight fast with 325 mg of pentabarbilal sodium given parenterally; the proximal portion of the small intestine was then quickly removed. Fifteencentimeter lengths of piglet jejunum were flushed with ice-cold norma.l saline, slipped over 5-ml pipettes for identification of Peyer's patches, stripped of muscular and visceral peritoneal layers, and opened into sheets. For light-microscopic studies, segments containing Peyer's patches and adjoining segments without patches were fixed in Bouin's solution, then in 95% ethanol, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For transport studies, adjacent segments were immediately mounted in conventional Ussing chambers (exposing an area of 1.27 cm Z ). Three pairs of tissue segments, each consisting of a patch-containing and a contiguous patch-free segment, were mounted in the chambers, using six chambers for each experiment. Chambers were per-fUSed with oxygenated chamber buffer (Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate, pH 7.4 at 37°C with 1 mg/ml porcine serum albumin and 3 mM D-glucose). After a 10-min equilibrium period, HRP (Sigma type II, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) was added to the mucosal compartment at a final concentration of 0.5 mM (20 mg/ml); in some experiments [3Bimanriitol, 10 p,Ci/chamber, final concentration 0.5 mM or [ 14 C]polyethylene glycol 4000, 10 p,Ci/chamber, 0.69 mM final concentration, or both, were added to the mucosal chamber also. Preliminary studies had established that neither of these latter two compounds altered HRP transpoit. Serial samples were taken from the serosal reservoir for measurement of the macromolecules added to the mucosal side of the tissue. To eliminate any effects of transmucosal potential difference (PD) on HRP movement, a short-circuiting current was applied throughout the experiment to reduce the PD to zero; PD and the shortcircuiting current were monitored at 10 min. In previous studies (2), we found that HRP did not alter the shortcircuiting current, but HRP transport was -10% higher across short-circuited tissue than across tissue that was not short-circuited.
 Horseradish peroxidase was assayed kinetically as previously described (2) using o-dianisidine as the indicator. Radioactivity was measured using Aquasol 2 scintillation fluid (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass.), in a Beckman MACROMOLECULAR ABSORPTION IN VIRAL ENTERITIS 999 L57500 Liquid Scintillation System equipped with a data reduction accessory (Beckman Instruments Inc., Irvine, Calif.) for double-label analysis. Mucosa-to-serosa transport rates were determined from the slope of the line describing probe appearance in the serosal chamber in the steady-state time period, 40-80 min after addition. Serosato-mucosa transport rates were not studied because of an apparent toxic effect of HRP when presented at the serosal surface (2) . Statistical comparisons were made using Student's t-test.
 The molecular weight distribution of the peroxidase activity appearing in the serosal chamber was examined by gel chromatography on a 1.5 x 27-cm column of Sephadex G-75 (fine) (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, N.J.), as previously described (2) . The peroxidase activity from the serosal chamber moved as a single peak identical to that seen for native BRP in studies of both control and infected animals, patch and nonpatch segments.
 Horseradish peroxidase (grade II), porcine serum albumin (fraction V), bovine serum albumin (fraction V). o-dianisidine, cytochrome c (practical), Sephadex G-75 (fine), and NaF were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.
 [ 14 C]Polyethylene glycol 4000 (sp act, 0.78 mCi/mg) and [3H]mannitol (sp act, 17 Ci/mmol) were obtained from New England Nuclear. All other chemicals were of reagent grade and obtained from local suppliers. Deionized water, prepared with a MilliQ apparatus (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) was used throughout.
 Measurements of jejunal crypts and villi from the three study groups ( Table 1) show that TGEassociated structural abnormalities were confined to segments that did not contain Peyer's patches. At 12 h, villi were shortened significantly but the specific features of the lesions varied considerably between the 5 pigs in the group. A severe lesion characterized by inflammatory exudate and small epithelial ulcerations was seen in 3 pigs; in the other 2 pigs, presumably seen earlier in the evolution of this rapidly progressive disease, there were shortened villi but only minimal epithelial disruption ( Figure  1 ). In pigs studied 96 h after receiving the TGE virus, when diarrhea was severe, the structural findings were identical to those seen previously during the same stage of this disease: shortened villi, deepened crypts, but an intact epithelium. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that, at this 96-h stage of TGE, the virus-infected cells are shed and the epithelium is composed of cells that have migrated up from the crypts at an accelerated rate but in a relatively undifferentiated stage (6) . No alterations could be identified at the light-microscopic level in the dome epithelium overlying Peyer's patches from pigs after infection. .
 In control piglet jejunum the pattern of appearance of peroxidase activity in the serosal chamber after placing HRP in the mucosal chamber resembled that observed in a previous study (2) . Horseradish peroxidase appeared first at 30-40 min and a steady state was maintained between 50 and 80 min when transport rates could be calculated. Mean permeability rates in Peyer's patch-containing and patch-free jejunal segments from control, 12-h, and 96-h TGE piglets are summarized in Figure 2 . In control piglets, the mean rate was 2.6 times higher across patch-containing tissue (p < 0.001) than nonpatch-containing segments. At the early viral invasion stage of TGE, 12 h after infection, peroxidase permeability (free) across patch-free tissue greatly exceeded control values (p < 0.05), and was similar to that occurring in patch-containing tissue from the same group and from controls. By 96 h after TGE infection, although the piglets had a mucosal lesion and diarrhea, peroxidase permeability had returned to normal in non-patch tissue. In patch-containing tissue from these 96-h piglets, HRP permeability actually was reduced compared with controls (p < 0.05), although it remained significantly greater than that occurring in patch-free segments. From the spread of the data summarized in Figure 2 , it is clear that between piglets, variation was much greater in 12-h than in 96-h piglets. Within the 12-h group of piglets, we observed the highest permeation rates in the jejuna judged to have the most severe epithelial disruption, but we could not correlate these rates with any measurable features of the jejunal lesion (i.e., villus height, crypt depth, or mucosal thickness). The lag between addition of HRP to the mucosal chamber and appeara.nce in the serosal chamber tended to be shorter in the group of piglets with severe lesions (0-36 min) than those with milder lesions (39 min), supporting a role for epithelial disruption in increased permeability rates.
 In Figure 3 , appearance of PEG and mannitol in the serosal chamber after their addition to the mucosal chamber are compared with that of peroxi- dase in a study of a patch-free segment of jejunum from a control pig. The lag times for these smaller molecules (mannitol, 9 min and PEG 4000, 10 min) were much less than that for the larger HRP molecule (43 min). All three molecules reached a steady state rate of appearance that varied inversely with molecular weight during the 80-min study. Mean permeability rates for the three groups of piglets seen in the lower panels of Figure 2 show patterns for PEG 4000 and mannitol quite different from those found for HRP in the upper panel. Patch-containing segments did not differ from patch-free segments in their permeability to PEG 4000 or mannitol in control or TGE piglets. Permeation of these smaller molecules was unchanged from controls at 12 h after TGE infection and significantly diminished in patch and nonpatch segments at 96 h (p < 0.05).
 Electrical Properties of the Tissue During the 90-min permeation studies, the electrical properties of the tissue remained stable ( Table 2 ). In control piglets PD across patch-contain- Patch ing segments was significantly less than that across patch-free segments. Normally, PD across the intestinal epithelium is generated by the Na/K adenosine triphosphatase in the basal lateral membrane of the mature villus enterocyte, whereas conductance, or permeability of the tissue to ions, reflects tissue surface area and integrity of the tight junctions (7) . The reduced PD but unchanged conductance in patch tissues most likely reflects the reduced proportion of mature villus enterocytes in patch epithelium.
 Transmural PD was significantly decreased across patch-free segments from piglets after TGE infection; previous studies have shown that this decrease is accompanied by diminished Na/K adenosine triphosphatase activity in TGE jejunum (8) . Conductance was altered significantly only at 96 h after TGE infection, when it was decreased, presumably due to reduced mucosal surface area. The electrical properties of patch and nonpatch tissue did not differ after infection, except at 96 h when the conductance of patch tissue was significantly lower than that of nonpatch tissue (p < 0.05).
 Very early in the course of invasive viral enteritis, absorption of HRP appears to be enhanced. Our column chromatography studies indicate that only intact HRP protein was detected under all study conditions. Macromolecule permeation has been found to be inversely related to molecular weight (9), a finding with which our in vitro control data agree. The anatomic site of size selectivity has not been identified. It has been modeled by a group of pores of varying size; most just large enough to admit mannitol, a small fraction large enough to admit PEG, and a still smaller fraction capable of admitting HRP (9) . If epithelial disruption opened up defects sufficiently large to admit HRP, as we suspect is this case, HRP passage mignt be affected relatively more than the passage of PEG or mannitol, which have numerous 
 Electrical properties of stripped piglet jejunal mucosa measured in Us sing chambers during course of transport studies (mean ± SEM).

It is unlikely that at the 12-h stage the disease significantly stimulated active processes associated with macromolecular uptake, as our previous experiments showed these processes to be confined to the Peyer's patch regions (2) where the disease had no impact on permeation at 12 h. Altered unstirred water layer resistance, presumed to be greater over nonpatch segments than over the dome epithelium, and therefore more influenced over nonpatch segments by mucosal disease, also could have changed HRP permeation. Again, however, some impact on PEG and mannitol movement would be expected if this mucosal surface phenomenon were a major factor. A relative increase in the vulnerability of 12-h TGE tissue to damage from the in vitro experimental technique, causing an artificial increase in permeability, is also unlikely. Tissues maintained electrical stability during the study period, without increasing conductance, suggesting that tissue integrity was well-preserved in the chambers.
 Our findings 96 h after infection were in marked contrast with those just described at 12 h. Permeation of HRP, normal in patch-free segments, indicates that during the diarrheal phase of viral enteritis, the jejunal mucosa is not excessively permeable to the macromolecule. Reduced uptake of the smaller molecules, PEG 4000 and mannitol, at the same stage, could be due to surface area and unstirred water layer changes, even though permeation of the larger and more slowly moving HRP molecule was not similarly affected. The reduced permeation of all three probe molecules through patch-containing segments at 96 h is unlikely to be related to surface area or surface water layer influences, as the epithelium over Peyer's patches was less distorted by this viral enteritis than the epithelium over patch-free segments. Alterations in epithelial uptake or subsequent processing of the probes in the epithelium or in the deeper layers could contribute to this reduced permeation at 96 h. The epithelial basement membrane, which under normal conditions is very porous in the Peyer's patch region (10) , could also be affected by the disease.
 Speculation on the relevance of our preliminary findings to clinical problems should be guarded. In attempting to explain the many syndromes of persisting diarrhea in young children, it has been postulated that small bowel lesions like viral enteritis might allow enhanced uptake of antigenic ally significant macromolecules, which in turn might stimulate local responses capable of causing ongoing intestinal damage. Our data do not support the concept of a major breakdown in the mucosal barrier to macromolecular absorption during viral diarrhea. Increased permeation appears to occur only during the early hours of the infection when virus disrupts the epithelium and not during diarrhea when the epithelium is relatively undifferentiated but intact. Our findings do not preclude possible ongoing immune-based mucosal damage In response to macromolecular antigens which continue to be taken up in the non-patch-containing regions of the intestine at normal rates throughout the disease.",67f3f210d910f661cdff26d34d2973f6d0e8245e,1985-04-30,"Keljo, David J.; Butler, Daniel G.; Hamilton, J.

Tandem arrays of five to eight WD40 repeats form a circularly permuted βpropeller domain structure 13 . SCF Cdc4 also targets other substrates including Far1, Cdc6 and Gcn4 1 . We pursued only SCF-I2 because SCF-I6 appeared to cause non-specific loss of Skp1-Cdc4 complex from the capture resin ( Fig  1b) . The two hydroxyl groups of BINOL are substituted by carboxylic acid groups in SCF-I2 (Fig. In addition, the carboxyl group of the top ring system hydrogen bonds to the NH group of the Trp657 side chain and forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Arg664. Critically, both Tyr574 and Leu634 comprise part of the highly conserved CPD binding infrastructure. The P-2 pocket is thus severely distorted by the reoriented side chains of Tyr574 and Leu634 in the SCF-I2 bound structure. In addition, the hydroxyl group of Tyr574 participates in stabilizing H-bond interactions with the side chain of Arg572, one of the four invariant essential Arg residues found in all Cdc4 orthologs 20 . We explored the determinants of the SCF-I2-Cdc4 interface. The residual inhibitory activity of SCF-I2 towards Fbw7 might be due to the conservative Arg-to-Lys substitution and the conservation of most other residues that form the induced SCF-I2 binding pocket (Fig 3b;  Supplementary Fig. Notably, the interaction of the regulatory protein phosducin with the G T β subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein transducin also causes significant structural rearrangements between adjacent WD propeller blades 22 . Second, the Cdc4 and Gβ structures show a remarkably close juxtaposition of induced binding pockets for the SCF-I2 and farnesyl ligands, respectively (Fig. WD40 domains may thus be inherently susceptible to disruption by insertion of appropriately configured small molecules between adjacent blades. Moreover, allosteric inhibitors may be combined with conventional binding pocket inhibitors to increase potency 27 .

In infected pigs, at the height of diarrhea, short-circuited ileal epithelium failed actively to transport Na+ and Cl-, and there was a defect of glucose-mediated Na+ transport. The Clsecretory response to theophylline remained intact. Conductance measurements indicate that paracellular permeability may be reduced and transcellular transport may be altered. A mucosal lesion was observed at the time of the transport changes, characterized by villus blunting, crypt hyperplasia, and immature crypt-type enterocytes on the villus epithelium, deficient in disaccharidase and (Na+, K+)A TPase activity but rich in thymidine kinase. Consideration of the major determinants of diarrhea in this invasive enteritis must take into account not only altered mucosal function and differentiation but also the extent of intestinal involvement, including the ileum, a major site of fluid absorption in the intestine.","Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), an acute invasive corona virus enteritis of piglets, has been established as a consistent experimental model of viral diarrhea. ' - 5 The TGE virus is thought to invade mainly the epithelium of the proximal intestine, 6 where abnormalities of water and electrolyte transport have been observed in vivo and in vitro at the height of diarrhea. 1.3 In jejunum in vitro, a specific defect of glucose stimulated sodium transport has been identified,3 a defect that coincides with the presence on the villous epithelium of immature crypttype enterocytes. 4 To assess the role of distal small intestine in the pathogenesis of this viral diarrhea, we measured Na+ and CI-transport across ileal epithelium in vitro at the height of diarrhea and changes in mucosal structure and epithelial differentiation. The ileum is an important site of fluid absorption in the intestine, and we postulated that altered ileal ion transport, a primary driving force for fluid absorption,7 may be a major determinant of the severity of viral diarrhea.
 Twenty-one [14] [15] [16] day old piglets from four litters of conventional York breed swine were studied: eleven received an inoculum of TGE virus' ; controls were matchedfed littermates. Infected animals were killed 40 hr after infection, by which time all had moderate-to-severe diarrhea. Sixty centimeters of ileum were removed, starting 5 cm from the ileocecal sphincter: 20 cm for enzyme analyses of isolated villus cells; 15 cm for ion transport studies in vitro; 5 cm for light microscopy; and another 20 cm for enzyme analyses of isolated cells.
 Four adjacent segments of ileal mucosa stripped of muscularis were placed in Us sing-type chambers,3 and steadystate unidirectional mucosa-to-serosa and serosa-to-mucosa Na+ and CI-fluxes were measured in paired tissues in the absence of an electrochemical gradient""; an appro-priate short-circuit current (Iso) was applied to nullify the measured spontane,.ous transepithelial potential difference (PD).8.9 Three consecutive flux study periods were used, and 15 min were allowed for equilibration before each: (a) spontaneous basal fluxes in the absence of glucose; (b) fluxes in the presence of 30 mM glucose; and (c) 10 mM theophylline added after glucose. Unidirectional fluxes Urns and Ism) were calculated,9 and net fluxes Une') were derived from Ims and Ism' expressed as lteq/cm 2 /hr. Net residual ion flux Unc,R), that part of the Is"" not accounted for by net movement of Na and CI, was calculated as Is"" -Inc,Na+lnc,cl, where Iso in itA was converted to It/eq/ cm/hr by multiplying by 0.0289 (3.6X10 3 / AF), where A = area of mucosa in cm 2 , and F = Faraday constant. Conductance of the tissue (mQ/cm2) was calculated as Isj PDxA.
 Tissue for light microscopy was fixed in Bouin's fluid, and sections were stained with hemotosylin and eosin. Coded sections were examined by one person without prior identification of the slide, and, as previously described,' measurements of villus height and crypt depth, mucosal morphology, and epithelial cell morphology were noted.
 Ileal villous enterocytes were isolated selectively with the use of a vibration technique that excludes crypt cells. lO The presence of intact crypts was confirmed by light microscopy after the isolation procedure.

 Results were analyzed with Student's t-test or, where appropriate, the paired t-test. Analyses of enzyme data were based on logarithmic distribution; results were analyzed as logarithms and expressed as antilogarithms.
 Ion Transport In Vitro Na+ flux ( Table 1) . Under short-circuited conditions, ileal epithelium from TGE-infected animals failed actively to transport sodium either in the presence or in the absence of glucose. In the absence of glucose under basal conditions, Ine,Na in TGE was negligible and significantly less than the control Inc,Na, which was absorptive; after administration of 30 mM glucose, Inc,Na in TGE tissue did not change significantly and remained negligible, in contrast to a significant increase in Inct Na in control tissue (P < 0.001). Under basal conditions, unidirectional fluxes (] ms Na and Ism Na) did not differ significantly between TGE and control tissue, but after administration of glucose, Ims Na in TGE was significantly less than the control value and the increment was greater in control tissue (P < 0.02). In the presence of 10 mM theophylline, added after glucose, Inct Na in TGE was ab-
 sorptive, although no significant changes in unidirectional or net fluxes occurred. In control tissue, theophylline caused an increased Ism Na (P < 0.01) and a decreased Inc,Na (P < 0.05), although control lnct"" remained significantly greater than TGE Inet Na .
 CI-flux ( Table 1 ). In the basal period, lms cl , Ism CI, and lne,c:l were lower in TGE compared with control tissue, lnel ci being negligible. Glucose did not significantly alter lnel ci in either tissue, although the increment was greater in control tissue compared with TGE tissue due to an increase in lms ci (P < 0.02), which was not observed in TGE tissue. ].m Cl did not change significantly in either tissue after glucose. Theophylline, added after glucose, caused net CI secretion in both control and TGE tissue, with significant alteration in both flux values (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively).
 Residual flux. A small Inet R was noted in both tissues and no differences were noted between control and TGE fluxes; both tissues responded similarly to both glucose and theophylline.
 Electrical data (Figure 1 ). In TGE tissue, spontaneous PD was negligible and lower than control PD (P < 0.001). The response to glucose was blunted in TGE compared with the response in controls (P < 0.001), and the PD remained lower (P < 0.001). During the theophylline period, PD in control tissues and PD in infected tissues were not significantly different. Similarly, the Is c (Figure 1 and Table 1 ) in TGE was negligible, and significantly less than control during the basal period (P < 0.001), and demonstrated a blunted response to glucose when compared with control (P value comparing increments < 0.01). Again, in the presence of theophylline, the differences in Is c between TGE and control tissue were no longer significant. Conductance was lower in TGE during basal and glucose study periods (P < 0.02), although an increment occurred in TGE tissue after administration of glucose (P < 0.02). During the theophylline period, conductance did not differ significantly between the tissues.
 Significant structural abnormalities were identified by light microscopy in the ileal mucosa in TGE at 40 hr. All TGE tissue was considered abnormal; mucosal changes varied from mild partial to complete villous atrophy with an abnormal cuboidal epithelium and an increase of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria. In Table 2 the mucosal measurements between control and TGE ileum 40 hr after infection are compared. In TGE mucosa, the villi were shorter, and the crypts were deeper than in control mucosa. Tobie Figure 2 depicts the alterations in the enzyme profile of ileal epithelial cells isolated selectively from the villi 40 hr after infection. Compared with control cells, TGE cells were deficient in lactase (P < 0.001), sucrase (P < 0.02), and Na+, K+ -ATPase activity (P < 0.001) but were rich in thymidine kinase activity (P < 0.005).
 Our studies indicate that functional and structural abnormalities can occur in the ileum in this invasive viral enteritis. Severe ileal transport disturbances could contribute to the pathogenesis of the diarrhea. Active sodium transport across ileal epithelium was defective under basal conditions, evidenced by negligible PD, short-circuit current, and net fluxes, and, as previously found in jejunum,3 there was failure of glucose-stimulated Na+ transport. In keeping with these observations, we found deficient Na+, K+ -ATPase activity in cells isolated from ileal villi, indicating a defective active Na+ ""pump"" in the basolateral membrane. In addition to alterations in transcellular active transport, unidirectional CI fluxes are reduced, and our electrical data indicate that tissue resistance (reciprocal of conductance) is raised, which implies an alteration in the low-resistance shunt properties of infected tissue. This may indicate a reduction in the size of extracellular pathways and therefore permeability, because shunt conductances of Na, K, and CI appear to account for a large portion of total conductance in intestinal tissue. 12 These alterations would be expected severely to affect water transport and lead to a net accumulation of water and electrolytes in the lumen, thus contributing to the diarrhea. The intact CI-secretory response to theophylline shown by the flux data supports previous findings that epithelial adenyl cyclase activity is unchanged in TGE,' which suggests that CI ion secretion mediated by cyclic AMP is not stimulated and does not playa role in the diarrhea. Previously, using an in vivo marker perfusion technique, we failed to find significant abnormalities of ion transport in the distal ileum of TGE-infected pigs. The discrepancy between these earlier in vivo data and the present in vitro findings could be due to (a) a difference between the two studies with respect to the extent and severity of the mucosal lesion or (b) factors affecting ion transport in vivo that cannot be assessed in vitro (e.g., blood and lymphatic flow). We suspect the former is the case, although, of course, we cannot exclude the latter. In the present study, the impact of the infection did extend into the ileum, as indicated not just by alteration of iontransport phenomena but also by structural and enzyme abnormalities. Our experience of ileal involvement in TGE is similar to that reported by oth-ers6 and is similar to that of other viral enteritides in infant animals. '3 -'5 The TGE virus invades primarily the epithelium of proximal small bowel, but invasion can extend for a variable distance to distal intestine."" Although the dose of virus and the timing of our experiments was constant, piglets were younger in the present studies than those studied in vivo. It is known that TGE is particularly severe in younger animals,'6 as is the case for other viral enteritides,'3-15 including human rota virus in humans.17 Clearly, the question of the relationship between age-determined severity and the extent of the intestinal lesion needs study.
 Villus blunting and crypt hyperplasia were seen in the ileum of TGE-infected animals. The extent and severity of the structural lesion seem variable, even under controlled experimental conditions, and we have shown previously that diarrhea can occur in the absence of a significant light microsopic lesion. The present morphologic data and the enzyme data on cells isolated from villi show a predominance of crypt-type cells in the ileal epithelium after infection, and the transport abnormalities resemble the transport characteristics of normal crypt cells studied in the rat, in which Na+ transport is defective compared with that in villous cells and fails to respond to glucose. '8 In addition, these findings support the concept of an ileal epithelium, which, like jejunal epithelium,' consists predominantly of undifferentiated immature enterocytes at the stage of severe diarrhea.
 The major viral enteritides, including human rotavirus enteritis,5.19 appear to have their greatest impact on the upper intestinal epithelium. These studies suggest that consideration of the mechanisms of diarrhea in viral enteritis must take into account not only altered function at a cellular level but also the extent of intestinal involvement. We' expect that factors determining the extent and severity of ileal dysfunction may playa major role in the pathogenesis and severity of viral diarrhea.",6056f4e00a22f2a1d44288d7dca28477ff493b8b,1979-01-31,"Shepherd, R.W.; Gall, D.G.; Butler, D.G.; Hamilton, J.R.",Gastroenterology,10.1016/s0016-5085(79)80122-5,Gastroenterology,368.0,True,"infection of epithelial cells results in massive immune-and virus-mediated cell death [1] [2] [3] ; however, the lost cells are readily replaced, as observed in the healing that follows a cold sore. Thus, the immune response to a viral challenge must be tailored to promote survival of infected neurons but to destroy infected epithelial or endothelial cells. However, such neuronal sparing might result in long-term consequences that are spatially or temporally separated from acute infection. We conclude with a forward-looking hypothesis: non-lytic clearance of neuronal infections may allow for persistence of RNA viruses that induce pathogenesis long after primary exposure. Although such characteristics may limit infections of CNSresident cells, these barriers can be breached. Neurotropic RNA viruses, including poliovirus (PV), measles virus (MV) and some flaviviruses, can circumvent these barriers by directly infecting the tightly associated endothelial or epithelial cells that comprise them 4 . In reality, however, modulating the barrier integrity is not as simple as this description implies. For example, IFNs, which are also produced in infected hosts, help to keep the barrier intact 8 ; thus, the relative type and ratios of cytokines that are synthesized in response to various infections will differentially affect barrier integrity 9 . Reactivation of the virus from latency -in response to decreases in immune monitoring, other infections or stress -leads to an active infection in PNS neurons, in which viral membrane proteins (including US9, glycoprotein E and glycoprotein I) can direct movement of newly replicated viral particles in an anterograde manner 13 . Beyond the value of these studies to understand how neurotropic viruses are propagated, viruses that spread across synapses (including RABV and MV) have provided a valuable method to trace neural circuits in vivo 16, 17 ; that is, the use of recombinant viruses encoding fluorescent proteins. These unique virological tools may also allow the development of strategies to deliver therapeutic payloads from the periphery to the CNS. The paucity of viral particles in the extracellular space may protect the neuron from plasma membrane damage via budding and facilitate evasion of antibody detection. An outcome of viral neuroinvasion is that the viral genome, viral proteins and/or complete virus particles may remain in the brain long after initial exposure. Other viruses result in pathogenesis only after protracted infection (such as tumour-causing viruses). For this Review, we use three classifications. The term 'latent' accurately conveys the status of these viruses: hidden, incapable of transmission, but able to fully reactivate, spread, and be transmitted to a new host. This process is unique to retroviruses, such as HIV-1 (REF. Infectious LCMV particles can be recovered from multiple organs throughout life and can be shed in the faeces or transmitted vertically to offspring 23, 27, 28 . Chronic non-transmissible infections are also characterized by sustained viral replication or consistent detection of viral nucleic acid over extended periods of time, but further host dissemination is absent. One example may be the rare cases of MV CNS infection. In both diseases, no viral dissemination to uninfected hosts has been reported. The early response to an infection typically begins with the engagement of pathogenic motifs by pattern recognition receptors, which are expressed on (or in) virtually all cells. These genes encode proteins that eliminate infected cells or aid in viral clearance. Type I IFNs also bind to adjacent, uninfected cells to shield them from infection. Delayed STAT activation coincides with delayed expression of traditional ISGs 41 . For example, when comparing microglia and oligodendroglia collected from mice that were infected with a neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), it was shown that microglia are the main producers of type I IFN and downstream ISG products 46 . These studies indicated how antigens and professional antigen-presenting cells can exit the CNS to alert immature T cells in the lymph nodes. This results in migration of T cells across the barrier (diapedesis). Although it was previously believed that neurons do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (and thus could not be recognized, at least in the canonical manner, by CD8 + T cells), we now know that some neuronal populations constitutively synthesize these cell surface proteins and that others can induce their expression after injury or infection 61, 62 . Even so, most neurons do not express typical levels of MHC class I antigens under noninflammatory conditions 63 , and thus T cell effector functions, including cytokine production, may not be triggered by the infected cell (the neuron) directly but rather by adjacent MHC class I-expressing cells (usually glia) that can display antigenic peptides via crosspresentation 64 . Although cross-presenting glia may not be directly infected, this strategy allows for elaboration of antiviral processes. Activated STAT1 homodimers translocate into the nucleus and bind to gamma-activated sequences (GASs) in the promoters of approximately 100 genes (which overlap with, but are generally distinct from, the ISGs that are induced by type I IFNs), promoting their transcription and translation (FIG. This diverse profile of genes that are induced may affect the cellular outcome: although IFNγ can induce necroptosis, in neurons the virus is controlled in a non-cytolytic manner (presumably owing to the paucity of STAT1 and non-traditional GAS gene induction) 69, 70 (FIG. IFNγ is crucial for the control of multiple neurotropic viral infections in mice and primary neuronal cultures. In these instances, granzymes are acting on proteins other than their traditional protein targets to induce an alternative neuronal response. It has also been speculated that viral RNAs and proteins can contribute to non-lytic outcomes. The notable absence of B cells in the brain of virus-infected mice led to the misperception that B cells and the antibodies that they secrete play a minor part in viral control. Answering this question will require further studies that must necessarily integrate virology, immunology and neurobiology. Indeed, unlike DNA viruses or retroviruses that can establish latent infections through episome formation or integration, RNA viruses do not have known means to 'survive' within a host cell. Accordingly, viral RNAs were generally considered 'fossils' that were unlikely to contribute to human disease. For example, infection of mice with the MHV strain A59, which is used to model the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis, leads to encephalitis and hepatitis. Other neurotropic RNA viruses that are known to persist within the mouse brain (sometimes for periods longer than 1 year post exposure) in the absence of detectable antigen or infectious viral progeny include Sindbis virus, Sendai virus and RABV 95, 105, 106 . The short answer is that we do not yet know. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurological disease of poorly understood aetiology that is characterized by consistent inflammatory response and immune-mediated pathogenesis. Limits of detection, reproducibility, consistency in the brain regions that are analysed and patient-to-patient variability all contribute to the challenges and dangers of ascribing neurotropic infections to be the aetiologic causes of poorly understood CNS diseases. Translational studies have provided insights into the links between infections and disease but are not without controversy. Moreover, trans-synaptic spread is likely to enable viral escape from antibody recognition or phagocytosis by antigen-presenting cells. Often, this is correlated with absence of detectable extracellular viral particles. At least two possibilities might explain the viral movement across the synapse. In the first scenario, the spread of viral particles between neurons requires ligand-receptor interactions, similar to infection in non-neuronal cells. The release of neurotransmitters and uptake of their receptors make the synaptic interface particularly fluid, which might make it uniquely able to support receptor-independent trafficking.

A research priority of the World Health Organization is to develop oral rehydration solutions containing amino acids or other additives that will stimulate intestinal absorption more efficiently than the current glucose-based oral rehydration solutions. Glutamine is the principal metabolic fuel of the small bowel and a putative stimulator of mucosal repair. This report describes the transport response to mucosal L-glutamine following intestinal injury caused by porcine rotavirus. Peak symptoms and mucosal damage were observed 2-7 days after oral rotavirus inoculation. In vitro transport studies of the maximally injured region, the midjejunum (80% reduction in lactase), surprisingly, showed transport responses to u-glutamine (30 mmoFL) and L-alanine (30 mmol/L) that were similar qualitatively and quantitatively to those observed in control tissue. Subsequent application of mucosal D-glucose (30 mmoFL) caused additional stimulation of electrogenic Na ÷ transport, but the response to glucose was blunted (P < 0.05) in the infected tissues. Glutamine and alanine enhanced Na + absorption to a similar degree (2-2.5 ~Eq-cm -z • h-l), but glutamine stimulated equal amounts of electrogenic and electroneutral NaCI absorption, whereas alanine had no significant effect on net C1-flux. Glutamine is a potentially useful substrate for investigation in oral rehydration solutions for infant diarrhea. V iral enteritis is the leading cause of diarrhea in infants and toddlers less than 2 years old (1) . Each year in the United States, about 22,000 infants are hospitalized for treatment of rotavirus-induced dehydration (2) . Central to the pathophysiology of diarrhea in one experimental model of viral enteritis, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), are the following intestinal abnormalities: impaired glucose and amino acidcoupled Na ÷ transport (3) (4) , defective NaC1 absorption (5) , diminished disaccharide hydrolysis (6) (7) (8) , and reduced mucosal absorptive surface (4, 8) . These abnormalities differ from those in enterotoxigenic diarrheas, in which C1-is actively secreted but mucosal surface area and Na÷-coupled organic solute transport are preserved.
 Glutamine, the chief metabolic fuel of the small intestine (9) , is an amino acid which cotransports Na ÷ across the enterocyte brush border membrane (10) . We compared the transport response to L-glutamine with the transport response to L-alanine. Compelling reasons to study glutamine in viral diarrhea include the observations that glutamine has been reported to stimulate intestinal mucosal growth and repair after chemotherapy-induced villus damage in rats (11) and that glutamine is a potent stimulator of electroneutral NaC1 absorption in the normal newborn pig jejunum (12) . In the current study, we characterized the intestinal response to L-glutamine in piglet rotavirus enteritis, a naturally occurring disease of major importance in newborn swine.
 Experiments were designed to prevent sow-acquired rotavirus infection. Piglets were reared in individual feed-ing cages and fed artificial formula (13) . Cross-bred sows in a barrier-intact intensive care farrowing facility were washed with povidone-iodine before delivery. The newborn piglets were caught on towels, taken to an isolation facility, caged, and fed [by an automatic feeding device (Autosow; Nutritech, Raleigh, NC)] 12.5 mL • kg -1 • h -I of an artificial formula, patterned after sow milk, which contained 20% solids composed of 30% protein, 40% lactose, 20% fat, electrolytes, trace minerals, and vitamins (13) .
 On day 4 after birth, experimental animals were administered approximately 106 rotavirus particles in 10-mL diet. The aliquots were obtained from a frozen stock of bacteria-[Tee fecal supernatant from rotavirus-infected piglets. Previous studies showed that animals infected in the first week of life uniformly experience viral enteritis (14) , although pigs infected later in life may also become ill. Body weight was checked every other day, and stool consistency was graded as follows: 1, solid feces; 2, soft, looser than normal stools; and 3, liquid diarrheal feces. Stool was assayed for rotavirus antigen by Vh, ogen Rotatest (Wampole Laboratories, Cranbury, NJ). Rotavirus positivity was scored 0+ to 4+ (4+ signifying a strongly positive result), based on the speed of agglutination.
 ,Animals were fasted for 6-8 hours before the intestine was removed for enzyme and transport studies. They were then given 50-70 mg ketamine IM and 2-4 minutes later were administered a lethal injection of 2-3 g sodium pentobarbital. Following an abdominal incision, the entire small bowel beginning 10 cm distal to the suspensory ligament was removed and flushed with ice-cold normal saline. The first 10 cm of proximal jejunum, a 20-cm segment obtained at the midpoint of the small intestine, and the distal 10 cm of terminal ileum were removed and placed in oxygenated Ringer's buffer; three 10-cm segments were scraped and homogenized for enzyme assays, as described bel6w. The remaining 10 cm of the midjejunum was placed in oxygenated transport buffer for ion flux studies. A 0.5-1-cm segment was placed in 10% formalin for light microscopic evaluation.
 Mucosa was scraped from the jejunal segments with a glass slide, divided in half, and homogenized in two buffers (0.1 g mucosa/mL buffer). The first sample was homogenized in 0.25 mol/L sucrose, 0.2 moUL Tris, 0.15 moUL KCI, 2.5 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 7.4, at 4°C; immediately frozen in aliquots at -70°C; and assayed within 2-3 weeks for sucrase (15) , lactase (15) , and total and ouabain-inhibitable adenosine triphosphatase (Na÷,K÷-ATPase) activities (8) . A second mucosal scraping was homogenized and frozen in 0.25 molfl, sucrose, 0.2 moUL Tris, 0.15 mol/L KCI, pH 7.4, and was later used to determine thymidine kinase activity (16) . Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (17) .
 Jejunum for transport studies was drawn over a plastic rod, incised longitudinally, and stripped of muscu-laris propria. Segments mounted between lucite halfchambers exposing an area of 1.13 cm 2 were bathed at 37°C in 10 mL of oxygenated buffer containing (in mmol/L) Na, 140; K, 5.2; Ca, 1.2; Mg, 1.2; C1, 119.8; HCO3, 25; H2PO ~, 0.4; and HPO 4, 2.4, pH 7.4. To provide metabolic fuel, 10 mmoUL glucose was added to the serosal buffer before the start of each experiment, with equimolar mannitol added on the mucosal side. Potential difference (PD) across the tissue was measured by calomel electrodes in saturated KC1, attached to agar bridges (4 g/dL, made up in Ringer's buffer) positioned near the surface of the tissue. The tissue was continuously short-circuited with automatic voltage clamps (World Precision Instruments, New Haven, CT), which compensated for the fluid resistance. Clamps introduced current to half-calls through Ag-AgCI electrodes which were connected to the chambers via agar bridges. All tissue sheets were mounted in the chambers within 30 minutes of the piglet's death and were continuously short-circuited, except for 5-second intervals every 20 minutes, when the open circuit PD was measured. Conductance (G) was calculated fTom the open circuit PD and short-circuit current (Isc) using Ohm's law. Transmucosal PD and Isc were stable for the entire study period, in both control and infected preparations.
 Chambers were paired so that tissue conductance did not differ by more than 25%, and data were discarded if conductance in a chamber pair differed by more than 25% during the experiment. Fifteen to twenty minutes after mounting the tissue, 22NaCI (2 p.Ci) and Na38CI (2 p.Ci) were added to either the mucosal or serosal reservoir. After 15-20 minutes of equilibration, unidirectional Na ÷ and C1-fluxes were calculated from isotopic determinations of 1.0-mL samples drawn at 20-minute intervals.
 At 40 minutes, 30 mmol/L L-glutamine or L-alanine powder was added to the mucosal side, balanced by equimolar mannitol on the opposite side. This concentration of amino acid was chosen because previous studies showed maximal electrical and Na ÷ transport response to L-alanine (4), L-glutamine (12) , and D-glucose (4,12) at 20-30 mmol/L in the proximal piglet jejunum. Twenty minutes later, we measured unidirectional ion fluxes at 20-minute intervals for a subsequent 40-minute period. Fluxes from mucosa to serosa 0ms) and from serosa to mucosa (Jsm) were determined from paired chambers, and J,~, was calculated. At 100 minutes, D-glucose (30 mmoUL) was added to both the mucosal and serosal baths, and Isc was determined for a subsequent 20-minute period.
 Jejunal strips were fixed in 10% formalin, blocked in para~n, and stained with H&E. A single observer (E.K.), blinded to the age of the animals, measured 6-10 representative, properly oriented crypts and villi using light microscopy with a Videoplan computer-assisted morphometry system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
 Wilcoxon signed rank test was used on matched flux data pairs to assess the significance of the mean flux increments. This test was chosen because it is a nonparametric test and therefore does not assume a normal distribution. Short-circuit current data for glucose response in control and infected pigs were compared using Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired data. Data are summarized as mean --SEM. Results of the tests are expressed as P values.
 All unlabeled chemicals were obtained from Sigma, St. Louis, MO. Z2NaCl and Na""6CI were obtained from Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL, and ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA, respectively.
 These studies were approved by the University of North Carolina Animal Care Committee.
 Thirteen piglets were inoculated with rotavirus; the infectior~ rate was 100% ( Figure 1 ). None of the animals died. Five piglets vomited once 2-3 days after inoculation, just before the onset of the diarrhea. Watery diarrhea ensued 48 hours after inoculation in most cases, typically lasting 3-6 days. In all but one animal, rotavirus shedding began 4-8 hours after Four days after inoculation, infected pigs had gained 420 -90 g in body wt, whereas uninfected controls had gained 500 _+ 30 g (P = NS). Fecal excretion of rotavirus was present at the time of death in all but one animal. High titer excretion (3+-4+ scores) occurred in 12 of 13 pigs. Fecal excretion of rotavirus, in two cases, resolved and later recurred. Only one animal was not excreting virus at the time of death.
 Microscopic evaluation of histological preparations from eight pigs (7-16 days of age), infected with rotavirus on day 4, and from 20 age-matched uninfected controls (6-15 days of age) demonstrated that rotavirus inoculation resulted in significant blunting of the midjejunal villi (by 50%) and no significant change in crypt depth (Table 1 ). Figure 2 shows the histological appearance of the jejunum from a normal pig and a piglet infected 4 days earlier. Whereas the normal midjejunal villus-crypt ratio was approximately 3:1, viral inoculation resulted in severe mucosal thinning, with a villus-crypt ratio of about 1:1. In addition, focal ballooning degeneration of enterocytes was noted, predominantly in areas between plicae. On the plicae, degeneration was less evident. Viral cytopathic effect was most prominent in the villus tips.
 Rotavirus infection significantly altered mucosal enzyme profiles in the proximal and midjejuhum and in the ileum. Table 2 shows enzyme data from the pigs described in Figure 1 and several other piglets infected on day 4 and killed < 16 days after inoculation. In proximal jejunum, we observed a significant reduction in Na÷,K÷-ATPase activity, whereas alkaline phosphatase activity was unaltered. Although lactase specific activity appeared reduced, the difference between control and infected animals was not statistically significant. In the ileum, rotaviru~infected tissues demonstrated significant reductions in both alkaline phosphatase and Na÷,K÷-ATPase activities; thymidine kinase, a crypt cell enzyme involved in mucosal regeneration (5, 16) , was elevated threefold. Even in pigs studied as late as 15 days after inoculation, mucosal enzymes remained markedly abnormal. The most severely damaged tissue was the midjejunum. Here, homogenate lactase specific activity was reduced to about 20% of normal for age, and alkaline phosphatase and Na*,K÷-ATPase activities were also reduced significantly. Thymidine kinase activity was increased sevenfold.
 Analysis of the effect of time after inoculation on enzyme activities showed that all pigs killed before 9 days after inoculation had similar levels of brush border enzymes and Na*,K÷-ATPase; however, one of the two pigs developing diarrhea >9 days after inoculation had a milder degree of damage as assessed by mucQsal enzymes. Thymidine kinase, in all parts of the bowel, peaked at 2-7 days after inoculation but remained elevated even in animals killed as late as 16 days after inoculation. Figure 3 shows thymidine kinase activities from homogenates of the midjejunum. Subsequent data (n = 9 pigs) showed that lactase activity remained < 50% of normal in pigs studied 2-3 weeks after inoculation.
 Control (7-12-day-old) piglet midjejunum, like the proximal jejunum in previous studies (5), secreted C1-and, to a lesser extent, secreted Na ÷ under basal conditions (Table 3) . Tissue conductance after L-glutamine increased by 40%-50%.
 L-Glutamine augmented net Na + an~l C1-transport (P < 0.005 and P < 0.025, respectively) via increased mucosal-to-serosal Na+ and C1-fluxes. There was an increase in J,~, which could represent increased flux across the paracellular pathway and/or stimulation of a transcellular Na ÷ secretory process. The magnitude of the increase in JsN~ was less than the increase in jN]. Analysis of the Na* absorptive response to glutamine showed that j N~ after glutamine increased more than Isc (2.6 _ 0.5 compared with 2.0 +_ 0.5 ~,Eq • cm -2 • h-~). While this difference was not significant, it should be noted that gtutamine stimulated a significant increase in net C1-flux (1.0_ 0.3 p.Eq-cm -2 • h-'}. This transmucosal absorption of C1in parallel with Na+ is an electrically silent (electroneutral) NaCl-absorptive response to glutamine. The en- hancement of neutral NaC1 absorption after glutamine was previously found to be even greater in the proximal piglet jejunum (ca 2 ~Eq-cm -z-h -~) (12) . L-alanine, in contrast to L-glutamine, stimulated electrogenic Na ÷ flux, via an increase in mucosal-toserosal Na ÷ flux, but did not alter mucosal-to-serosal or net C1-fluxes. Like glutamine, alanine increased tissue conductance and serosal-to-mucosal fluxes of Nd ÷. Alanine did not alter JCm' s significantly, and although J,C]e, consistently decreased after this amino acid, the decrease in net CI-flux after alanine did not reach statistical significance. However, alanine significantly enhanced CI-flux in the secretory direction (A~ = 1.1 ~Eq. cm -2 • h-'; P < 0.05) in normal piglet jejunum.
 Jejunal response in tissues of age-matched rotavirusinfected animals was studied 2-7 days after inoculation (Table 4 ). Basal electrical parameters and Na ÷ and C1-fluxes were virtually identical to those in control midjejuna. To our surprise, we found that responses to the two amino acids were qualitatively and quantitatively quite similar to those in uninfected tissue. L-glutamine increased tissue conductance, whereas L-alanine did not significantly alter conductance. In addition, the infected tissue demonstrated an increase in serosal-to-mucosal Na* flux (ca 2 ~Eq"" cm -2 • h-~).
 L-alanine, in rotavirus-damaged tissues, stimulated net Na ÷ flux (2.7 p.Eq. cm -2 • h -~) while not signifi-cantly altering net C1-flux. In contrast, L-glutamine augmented both Na ÷ (2.3 ~Eq • cm -2 • h) and C1-flux (1.2 p.Eq. cm -2. h -~) significantly. The finding of increased Isc and increased Na ÷ and C1-transport are compatible with dual transport effects of glutamine, whereby electrogenic (glutamine-Na ÷) cotransport and also electroneutral NaCI absorption are stimulated by the amino acid.
 In the small intestine, mucosal glucose stimulates electrogenic Na ÷ absorption. The increase in J,~, after glucose equals the increase in Isc (19) . In our studies (Figure 4) , when D-glucose (30 mmol/L) was added after L-glutamine, we found that both control and infected tissues responded to glucose with an increase in Isc. However, response in controls exceeded response in the rotavirus-infected group by more than twofold (P < 0.05).
 Colostrum-deprived piglets provide a particularly useful model of enteritis, because each animal is agammaglobulinemic and therefore susceptible to viral invasion and mucosal injury. Our studies of swine rotavirus enteritis in newborn artificially reared piglets are consistent with the findings in other piglet enteridites (coronavirus and TGE enteritis, human rotavirus enteritis in conventional pigs (20) , and porcine rotavirus enteritis in gnotobiotic piglets (21)). In piglet models of diarrhea, the epithelium is dominated by crypt-type enterocytes, with villus blunting, increased specific activity of an enzyme involved in DNA replication (thymidine kinase), and significantly reduced brush border hydrolases and basolateral Na*,K÷-ATPase activities. Infant mice infected with rotavirus appear to develop a much milder lesion (22, 23) . Biopsy data obtained from human infants suffering from rotavirus enteritis show abnormalities similar to the porcine lesion, although a spectrum of villus damage is seen (24) . Previous studies of transport in proximal jejuna of normal pi~s showed that stripped jejunum in Ussing chambers secretes C1-and, to a lesser extent, Na ÷ (5, 12, 25) . Na ÷ secretion persists in the absence of CI-, is associated with a residual flux, and is abolished in the nominal absence of HCO3, suggesting that pig jejunum secretes NaHCO3 in an electrogenic manner (25) . Na-(HCO3-)3 secretion is well established in the renal tubule (26) . As in our previous studies of piglet TGE (4,5), we found no differences in basal ion transport, comparing rotavirus-infected with normal jejunum.
 Reduced intestinal glucose-stimulated Na ÷ transport has been shown to be the most consistent functional abnormality in previous studies of TGE enteritis (3, 18) . Brush border membrane vesicle studies indicated the loss of a high-affinity glucose-Na ÷ cotransporter (7) . In the current studi~s, we determined that the Isc response to mucosal glucose is abnormal (Figure 4 ) (in the presence of glutamine) in the rotavirus-infected gut. The observation is compatible with a defect in epithelial glucose-Na ÷ cotransport and/or to a reduced maximal transport capacity in the rotavirus-infected gut. Potential contributing factors include a brush border carrier defect and the observed 40% reduction of Na÷,K ""pump"" activity in diseased tissue.
 The major goal of our study was to compare the effects on transport of the two amino acids L-alanine and L-glutamine. Our data confirm that amino acid and glucose have combined effects .in enhancing Na ÷ absorption across the virus-damaged gut. Glutamine and alanine were equally effective in vitro stimulators of Na ÷ absorption in control and rotavirus-infected jejuna. Glutamine stimulates Na ÷ transport in newborn piglet proximal jejunum primarily by an electroneutral, rather than electrogenic Na÷-coupled mechanism (12) ; serosal glutamine, we have found, will also increase NaC1 transport (12) . In the mid intestine, the current studies demonstrate that electrogenic glutamine-Na ÷ cotransport predominates over NaCI absorption. Although we have consistently observed a NaC1 absorptive response to glutamine, whether it is added to the mucosal or serosal sides of the tissue, we have shown that C1-absorption does not increase after mucosal phenylalanine or glucos.e. The latter two substrates, in pig jejunum, are transported solely by a Na÷-coupled mechanism (12) .
 We suggest that either transmucosal NaC1 absorption or coupled Na÷/H ÷, C1-/HCO/exchanges may be stimulated by glutamine in rotavirus-injured jejunum. MacLeod and Hamilton found in coronavirusdamaged piglet small bowel that mucosal-to-serosal Na ÷ and C1-fluxes were low and could not be reduced further by furosemide or theophylline (5) . They speculated that jejunal epithelial cell NaC1 absorption may be absent in severe viral enteritis. One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy between our findings and theirs is that brush border NaC1 transport in TGE may be present but inhibited in the basal state. Transmucosal NaCI absorption could be inhibited by factors released in the subepithelium, such as immune cell mediators or neurotransmitters discharged from enteric nerves (27) . Mucosal glutamine may counteract this inhibition, by altering the metabolism of epithelial or lamina propria cells.
 The brush border membrane of differentiated villus cells is the primary site of glucose-facilitated Na ÷ absorption (7) . If amino acid-Na ÷ cotransport is primarily carried out at the villus tip, as suggested by the autoradiographic studies of Smith (28) , one might have anticipated that the rotavirus-infected preparations would have responded poorly to glutamine and alanine. However, we observed a normal transport response in the infected jejunum (Table 4) . A normal' increment in absorption in an epithelium with reduced villus surface area strongly suggests the enterocytes populating the damaged tissue are actually responding with increased glutamine-stimulated Na ÷ transport.
 Our data do not explain this robust transport response; however, a potentially relevant finding is that the specific activity of phosphate-dependent glutaminase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme for mitochondrial glutamine oxidation, is maximal in cells isolated from the villus-crypt junction (29). Nagy et al. found that oxidation of labeled glutamine to CO2 was increased 75% in cells at the crypt neck compared with villus or crypt cells (29) . The rapid intracellular metabolism of this important fuel by crypt-type cells could, in theory, stimulate the Na÷,K ÷-ATPase and increase electrolyte absorption or could enhance L-glutamine-Na ÷ entry by preventing intracellular accumulation of the amino acid.
 Oral rehydration therapy (ORT), one of the major medical advances of the century, is believed to promote gut absorption because of the high concentrations of both glucose and Na ÷, substrates which are transported in a coupled manner across the brush border (19) . Unfortunately, when the bowel is injured by common pathogens such as rotavirus, infants administered standard ORT malabsorb at least 10% of ingested glucose (30) . Recent attempts at improving ORT have been based on the assumption that adding one or more amino acids cotransported with Na ÷ to standard ORT could promote greater absorptive flows of Na÷'and water (31,32)• For example, a solution containing glucose and L-alanine, in a large doubleblind trial, was shown to be more effective than standard glucose ORT in human cholera (32) .
 The current data show no impairment of the alanine response in rotavirus enteritis• We previously found blunted alanine-stimulated Na ÷ transport in acute TGE enteritis in pigs (4); however, our enzyme data suggest that rotavirus enteritis induces a milder lesion in pigs than TGE. Of possible concern regarding the use of L-alanine in the treatment of viral enteritis in infants is the observation that L-alanine • CI consistently increases Jsm (Tables 3 and 4 ). Although a statistically significant effect of alanine on net C1secretion across the mucosal barrier was not demonstrated in the current studies, L-alanine is a recognized activator of CI-channels in enterocytes (33) . Furthermore, in the ileum of newborn rabbits, a tissue with a much higher transmural conductance than piglet jejunum, alanine has no effect on Na ÷ absorption and significantly increases transepithelial C1secretion (34) . This finding is of concern if an oral rehydration solution (ORS) containing alanine and glucose are to be studied in infants. On the basis of these in vitro findings, we speculate that an ORS containing glutamine and glucose might be superior to conventional, glucose ORT in viral enteritis. Glutamine appears to be an effective stimula-tor of Na ÷ and NaCI transport in rotavirus-damaged jejunum.",4a26503397de0623f9fe1191baf613d314093874,1991-12-31,"Rhoads, J.

Any consideration of the immunologic relevance of these complex phenomena must take into account the specialized function of the Peyer's patch regions of the small intestine. The small intestine, particularly its Peyer's patch region, is capable of assimilating antigenically significant amounts of macromolecules (1, 2) . This study was designed to determine whether normal patterns of macromolecular absorption are distorted by mucosal disease. Conventional York Landrace piglets, obtained at 14 days Abbreviations used in this paper: HRP, horseradish peroxidase; TGE, transmissible gastroenteritis. After a 10-min equilibrium period, HRP (Sigma type II, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) was added to the mucosal compartment at a final concentration of 0.5 mM (20 mg/ml); in some experiments [3Bimanriitol, 10 p,Ci/chamber, final concentration 0.5 mM or [ 14 C]polyethylene glycol 4000, 10 p,Ci/chamber, 0.69 mM final concentration, or both, were added to the mucosal chamber also. Preliminary studies had established that neither of these latter two compounds altered HRP transpoit. Statistical comparisons were made using Student's t-test. All other chemicals were of reagent grade and obtained from local suppliers. In control piglet jejunum the pattern of appearance of peroxidase activity in the serosal chamber after placing HRP in the mucosal chamber resembled that observed in a previous study (2) . Horseradish peroxidase appeared first at 30-40 min and a steady state was maintained between 50 and 80 min when transport rates could be calculated. Permeation of these smaller molecules was unchanged from controls at 12 h after TGE infection and significantly diminished in patch and nonpatch segments at 96 h (p < 0.05). Electrical Properties of the Tissue During the 90-min permeation studies, the electrical properties of the tissue remained stable ( Table 2 ). In control piglets PD across patch-contain- Patch ing segments was significantly less than that across patch-free segments. Very early in the course of invasive viral enteritis, absorption of HRP appears to be enhanced. It has been modeled by a group of pores of varying size; most just large enough to admit mannitol, a small fraction large enough to admit PEG, and a still smaller fraction capable of admitting HRP (9) . If epithelial disruption opened up defects sufficiently large to admit HRP, as we suspect is this case, HRP passage mignt be affected relatively more than the passage of PEG or mannitol, which have numerous

NS, not significant; TGE, transmissible gastroenteritis. The reduced permeation of all three probe molecules through patch-containing segments at 96 h is unlikely to be related to surface area or surface water layer influences, as the epithelium over Peyer's patches was less distorted by this viral enteritis than the epithelium over patch-free segments. Our findings do not preclude possible ongoing immune-based mucosal damage In response to macromolecular antigens which continue to be taken up in the non-patch-containing regions of the intestine at normal rates throughout the disease."
47,47,88a7cc8e8feec930bbe0f5772fafca84c9f20a7a,,The Mucosal Lesion in Viral Enteritis Extent and Dynamics of the Epithelial Response to Virus Invasion in Transmissible Gastroenteritis of Piglets,"In transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) of piglets, an infection closely resembling human rotavirus enteritis, we studied the timing and extent of epithelial viral invasion along the small intestine after a single oral inoculum of virus; we related these findings to measured alterations in mucosal structure, kinetics, and differentiation, and to previously documented abnormalities of ion transport that occurred at the height of diarrhea. Six and twelve hours after inoculation, before diarrhea, extensive specific viral immunofluorescence and viral particles on electron microscopy were seen in villus but not crypt enterocytes in jejunum, mid-intestine, and ileum. At 24 and 40 hr, when diarrhea was most severe, immunofluorescence was patchy; villus blunting (P < 0.001) and increased crypt depth (P < 0.001) were observed by light microscopy in all segments; radioautographically labeled enterocytes showed accelerated migration and shortened life span; and cells on villi were deficient in sucrase activity (P < 0.001) and","rich in thymidine kinase activity (P < 0.005), suggesting relative immaturity. Villus structure recovered by 72 and 144 hr, although deeper crypts (P < 0.001) and accelerated migration still persisted. We conclude that extensive, almost simultaneous direct viral invasion of villus enterocytes can occur along the entire length of the small intestine after a single exposure to virus, and thus can cause shedding of mature villus cells and proliferation and accelerated migration of cells from the crypts. At the height of diarrhea, when enterocyte turnover is maximal, the epithelium consists predominantly of immature virus-free cells which have migrated to the villi in a relatively undifferentiated state.
 Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), an acute selflimited invasive infection of the small intestine occuring in young pigs, is caused by a Corona virus. Earlier studies of this disease identified specific defects on intestinal transport associated with the presence on villi of poorly differentiated crypt-type enterocytes; these abnormalities coincided with the occurrence of severe watery diarrhea. ' -s The present experiments used an immunofluorescence technique to determine the timing and extent of viral invasion during the course of experimental TGE infection. These findings were related to the development of functional and structural abnormalities in the small intestinal epithelium. When administered to young pigs under standardized conditions, we found previously that the TGE virus consistently caused diarrhea beginning at about 18 hr, peaking at 40 hr after which it subsided.1.2 .• Pensaert et al. have shown invasion of the epithelium within 6 hr and shedding of infected cells within 24 hr. 7 We suspect that the im- 
 Sixty-six 14 to 16-day-old piglets from litters of conventionally weaned York swine received an intragastric inoculum of a standard dose of TGE virus,' and 20 uninfected littermates, matched for food intake and age, served as controls. Groups of animals were killed at intervals of 6-144 hr after infection and intestine taken from 3 sites-proximal jejunum (5-15 cm from ligament of Treitz), mid small intestine (10 cm around midpoint), and ileum (5-65 cm from ileocecal sphincter). In'the first study at 6, 12, 24, 30, 40, 72 , and 144 hr, we examined epithelial viral immunofluorescence (IF) and mucosal structure at all three sites and measured sucrase and thymidine kinase activities in isolated villus cells from the ileal segment. Viral TGE antigen was detected by direct IF, using a fluorescein-conjugated porcine anti-TGE globulin (used for IF diagnosis of field cases, and kindly donated by Dr. A. Gagnon, University of Guelph). Specificity was tested by twostage inhibition using TGE-inoculated and noninfected Ileal villus enterocytes were isolated selectively with a vibration technique that excludes crypt cells,'o and the presence of intact crypts was confirmed by microscope examination of tissue after the isolation procedure. For enzyme analyses, cells were homogenized and stored at -20°C for assays of thymidine kinase and sucrase activity.' In the second study, enterocyte migration in proximal jejunum and ileum was measured by autoradiography. Piglets were injected with [3H]thymidine (0.3 /LCi/g) , and subgroups were killed 6, 12, or 24 hr later so that migration of labeled cells could be measured in relation to mucosal structure. Migration was studied during three stages of the disease (0-24, 36-60, and 120-144 hr) and compared with control data, using six-eight piglets for each study period. Samples of intestine from each site were oriented on wax, fixed in Bouin's reagent for 12 hr, transferred to 95% alcohol, and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections ( Coded sections were examined with a calibrated eyepiece by one person, who selected from each section (excluding areas over Peyer's patches) 10-30 longitudinally well-oriented crypt-villus columns with the lumen in continuity. Crypt-villus column height and the distance of foremost labeled cells (FLC) from crypt base were measured; in addition, to allow for changes in column height, the mean position of FLC was expressed as a percentage of column height. Migration rates were expressed as change in position of FLC per hour, and the mean enterocyte transit time (time taken for label to reach the villus tips) was calculated for each stage of the disease. Results were analyzed with Student's t-test. Analyses of enzyme data were based on the assumption of a logarithmic distribution for the data, and the results were expressed as antilogarithms.
 Specific epithelial viral IF was observed consistently in proximal jejunum, mid small intestine, and ileum of all animals studied at 6, 12, and 24 hr after infection but was rare at 40, 72, and 144 hr (Figure 1 and Table 1 ). In control tissue, nonspecific pale yellow plasma fluorescence was observed in the lamina propria. The specific apple-green viral immunofluorescence that appeared in the apical cytoplasm of villus enterocytes of infected tissue, particularly toward the tips (Figure 1 ), was not seen in the crypts and appeared to be confined to the villus epithelium. At 6 hr, IF was observed in most of the villus epithelium of proximal and mid small intestine but was concentrated in the villus tips in the ileum; in one piglet it was limited to the proximal segments only (Table 1) . At 12 hr, IF appeared equally extensive in all segments, but by 24 hr it was inconsistent, patchy, and confined to occasional blunted villus tips.
 Significant structural abnormalities were observed on light microscopy in all three intestinal segments-after the time when viral IF was maximal. In infected pigs (Figure 2 ), at 24 and 40 hr, the villi were shorter, and crypts were deeper than controls (P < O.OO1), and by 72 and 144 hr the villi were recovering although crypts remained hyperplastic. At 40 hr, the mucosal lesion in all three segments varied from mild partial villus atrophy to flattening of the mucosa (Figures 3 and 4) , the villus epithelium was cuboidal with a poorly defined brush border,crypts were hyperplastic, and the lamina propria was infiltrated with inflammatory cells ( Figure 3B ).
 By electron microscopy at 12 and 24 hr and in an occasional cell in one animal at 40 hr, viral particles were seen in the brush border and in the cytoplasm of villus surface enterocytes ( Figure 5 ). Viral particles were not seen in crypt epithelium at any stage or in any tissue taken at later stages of infection. At 24 and 40 hr, villus surface enterocytes seen by electron microscopy and compared with controls had irregular sparse microvilli, apical nuclei, fewer organelles of the apical cytoplasm (Figure 6) , and intraepitheliallymphocytes were observed.
 Enzyme Activities in Ileal Villus Enterocytes Sequential changes in sucrase and thymidine kinase activities in villus cells isolated 12, 24, 40, 72, and 144 hr after infection are shown in Table 2 . By 24 and 40 hr, sucrase activity was significantly less than in cells from controls, and thymidine kinase activity was significantly greater. By 144 hr, thymidine kinase activity did not differ from controls, although the villus cells were still sucrase deficient.
 The position of foremost-labeled cells in crypt-villus columns, expressed both as distance from crypt base and as a percentage relative to column height, are shown in Table 3 . In both jejunum and ileum, mean distance from crypt base was significantly greater than the corresponding control measurement 6 hr after labeling in the TGE-infected groups studied at 36 and 120 hr after infection (P < 0.001). In those given label 36 hr after infection, the foremost label at 6 and 12 hr was significantly further from the crypt base than in those studied earlier (0-24 hr) and later (120-144 hr) in the disease (P < 0.001, respectively); in fact, at this stage of the disease the label had reached the tips of villi within 24 hr of injection. When FLC position was expressed as a percentage of column height, allowing for ob- served changes in column height, similar differences were observed in both segments ( Table 3) . As indicated in the table, these data are reflected in the migration rates, expressed as distance traveled by the foremost-labeled cell per hour. In TGE, migration rates greatly exceeded control values, particularly in the 36-60 hr infected group (TGE, 16.7 and 12.7 vs. control, 8.9 and 7.0 J.L/hr in jejunum and ileum, respectively). The estimated time taken for foremost labeled cells to reach the villus tips was markedly reduced in both jejunum and ileum during TGE, related both to a significant increase in migration as previously indicated, and to a significant reduction in total crypt-villus column height at certain stages of infection (Table 3) . For example, the enterocyte transit time or life span was 55 hr in control jejunum, compared with 18 hr for cells labeled 36 hr after infection in TGE. During this study period, the measurements of column height were all significantly less than control measurements (P < 0.001).
 The present observations help to clarify the relationship between viral invasion and the functional defect characterized in our earlier studies. The abnormalities of ion transport observed in jejunum ' ·3.4 and ileum 6 at the height of diarrhea in TGE are clearly a response to direct visual invasion of these intestinal regions, but they occur after viral IF has disappeared from the mucosa. Our observations support earlier data from Pensaert et al.' on the time of appearance and disappearance of TGE IF in the jejunum. They also show that infection of the ileum coincides with jejunal infection, and, therefore, it is unlikely to be a consequence of exposure to virus shed from infected upper gut.
 The TGE virus invaded the villus but not the crypt epithelium of the small intestine within hours of administration. Because the virus is absent from the epithelium of the resulting mucosal lesion, we assume that the infected cells have been shed at that stage, replaced by relatively undifferentiated enterocytes as judged by structural and enzymatic criteria, and not reinfected by virus. As others have noted,7 villus cells seem particularly susceptible to invasion by the TGE virus. Many factors could be involved in this apparent resistance of less differentiated crypttype enterocytes to virus invasion. On electron microscopy, we observed viral particles actually traversing intact microvilli of mature epithelial cells; perhaps a brush-border receptor is synthesized as enterocytes differentiate in the course of their migration from crypt to villus tip.
 As infected villus cells are shed, our kinetic and enzyme data show that the epithelium proliferates and migration of cells from the crypts accelerates. The pathogenesis of this proliferation is unknown, but a negative feedback from mature villus epithelium has been postulated in normal mucosa."" As the replacement enterocytes migrate, they have a shortened life span and at the peak of disease fail to differentiate fully. The findings of defective differentiation and shortened life span strongly support the concept that, at the height of diarrhea, the renewed epithelium in TGE consists predominantly of immature cells.1.4·7 Clearly, the abnormalities in transport function which reflect an alterated balance between immature crypt and mature villus cells cannot be attributed directly to the presence of virus. Several acute viral intestinal infections affecting the young of various species appear to follow the sequence just outlined for TGE, with invasion and desquamation of mature villus cells, leading to a mucosal lesion and to diarrhea coincident with epithelial regeneration. These include coronavirus enteritis of dogs '3 and calves"" and rotavirus enteritis of piglets,""5 lambs,'6 and calves.17 Our recent experience with human rotavirus enteritis induced in pig-lets!8 leads us to believe that a similar sequence of events may occur in the human condition. Because this epithelial response is central to the pathogenesis of diarrhea caused by viral invasion, factors that influence mucosal renewal such as age, drugs, and nutrition '9 . 2o may be significant determinants of recovery from these diseases.",88a7cc8e8feec930bbe0f5772fafca84c9f20a7a,1979-04-30,"Shepherd, R.W.; Butler, D.G.; Cutz, E.; Gall, D.G.; Hamilton, J.R.",Gastroenterology,10.1016/s0016-5085(79)80177-8,Gastroenterology,368.0,True,"Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), an acute invasive corona virus enteritis of piglets, has been established as a consistent experimental model of viral diarrhea. ' - 5 The TGE virus is thought to invade mainly the epithelium of the proximal intestine, 6 where abnormalities of water and electrolyte transport have been observed in vivo and in vitro at the height of diarrhea. 1.3 In jejunum in vitro, a specific defect of glucose stimulated sodium transport has been identified,3 a defect that coincides with the presence on the villous epithelium of immature crypttype enterocytes. Infected animals were killed 40 hr after infection, by which time all had moderate-to-severe diarrhea. Ileal villous enterocytes were isolated selectively with the use of a vibration technique that excludes crypt cells. Analyses of enzyme data were based on logarithmic distribution; results were analyzed as logarithms and expressed as antilogarithms. Ion Transport In Vitro Na+ flux ( Table 1) . Under basal conditions, unidirectional fluxes (] ms Na and Ism Na) did not differ significantly between TGE and control tissue, but after administration of glucose, Ims Na in TGE was significantly less than the control value and the increment was greater in control tissue (P < 0.02). .m Cl did not change significantly in either tissue after glucose. During the theophylline period, PD in control tissues and PD in infected tissues were not significantly different. In Table 2 the mucosal measurements between control and TGE ileum 40 hr after infection are compared. The intact CI-secretory response to theophylline shown by the flux data supports previous findings that epithelial adenyl cyclase activity is unchanged in TGE,' which suggests that CI ion secretion mediated by cyclic AMP is not stimulated and does not playa role in the diarrhea. The discrepancy between these earlier in vivo data and the present in vitro findings could be due to (a) a difference between the two studies with respect to the extent and severity of the mucosal lesion or (b) factors affecting ion transport in vivo that cannot be assessed in vitro (e.g., blood and lymphatic flow). We suspect the former is the case, although, of course, we cannot exclude the latter. It is known that TGE is particularly severe in younger animals,'6 as is the case for other viral enteritides,'3-15 including human rota virus in humans.17 Clearly, the question of the relationship between age-determined severity and the extent of the intestinal lesion needs study. The present morphologic data and the enzyme data on cells isolated from villi show a predominance of crypt-type cells in the ileal epithelium after infection, and the transport abnormalities resemble the transport characteristics of normal crypt cells studied in the rat, in which Na+ transport is defective compared with that in villous cells and fails to respond to glucose. ' We' expect that factors determining the extent and severity of ileal dysfunction may playa major role in the pathogenesis and severity of viral diarrhea."
48,48,b0407f35d4c09d63357ff8a5d89e274bbbdbba0c,,Article Autoadaptive ER-Associated Degradation Defines a Preemptive Unfolded Protein Response Pathway,"Folding-defective proteins must be cleared efficiently from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to prevent perturbation of the folding environment and to maintain cellular proteostasis. Misfolded proteins engage dislocation machineries (dislocons) built around E3 ubiquitin ligases that promote their transport across the ER membrane, their polyubiquitylation, and their proteasomal degradation. Here, we report on the intrinsic instability of the HRD1 dislocon and the constitutive, rapid turnover of the scaffold protein HERP. We show that HRD1 dislocon integrity relies on the presence of HRD1 clients that interrupt, in a dose-dependent manner, the UBC6e/RNF5/p97/ proteasome-controlled relay that controls HERP turnover. We propose that ER-associated degradation (ERAD) deploys autoadaptive regulatory pathways, collectively defined as ERAD tuning, to rapidly adapt degradation activity to misfolded protein load and to preempt the unfolded protein response (UPR) activation.","The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a site of synthesis and maturation of about 30% of the eukaryotic proteins. This membrane-bound organelle faces a continuous, physiologic production of byproducts of protein biogenesis, which results from the innate inefficiency of protein folding programs (Braakman and Hebert, 2013) . The ER load with folding-defective polypeptides may fluctuate and depends on variations in the level of protein synthesis, inherited or sporadic mutations causing polypeptide misfolding, infections, perturbation of the folding environment, aging, and other factors. Misfolded proteins must rapidly be removed from the folding compartment as a prerequisite for maintenance of cellular proteostasis and survival (Balch et al., 2008; Brodsky, 2012; Lindquist and Kelly, 2011; Merulla et al., 2013; Walter and Ron, 2011) . Aberrant gene products are delivered at the ER membrane to be retrotranslocated (dislocated) into the cytosol, polyubiquitylated, and degraded by 26S proteasomes in a series of events collectively defined as ER-associated degradation (ERAD; Brodsky, 2012) . The activity of the ERAD machinery must be adjusted to the luminal load of misfolded polypeptides. Excessive ERAD may in fact interfere with completion of folding programs by inappropriately selecting not-yet-native folding intermediates for destruction, while insufficient ERAD leads to toxic accumulation of misfolded protein conformers (Bernasconi and Molinari, 2011) . Recent evidences hint at direct roles of misfolded polypeptides in regulating ERAD activity by stabilizing otherwise rapidly turned over ERAD factors, by inhibiting the constitutive segregation of ERAD factors from the ER, or by promoting the assembly or inhibiting the disassembly of functional ERAD machineries in a series of posttranslational regulatory events, collectively defined as ERAD tuning (Merulla et al., 2013) .
 With a constitutive proteasome-regulated half-life of 1 hr, HERP is one example of rapidly turned over ERAD factor (Hori et al., 2004; Miura et al., 2010; Sai et al., 2003) . The involvement of HERP in ERAD has been reported, as well as its participation in the evolutionarily conserved dislocation machinery built around the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1 that also comprises the adaptor protein SEL1L, the rhomboid pseudoprotease DER1, and a series of membrane-embedded, luminal, and cytosolicassociated factors (Bernasconi et al., 2010a; Christianson et al., 2012; Eura et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2010; Horn et al., 2009; Iida et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2008; Kny et al., 2011; Kokame et al., 2000; McLaughlin et al., 2010; Okuda-Shimizu and Hendershot, 2007; Sato et al., 2012; Schulze et al., 2005; Stolz et al., 2010; van Laar et al., 2000) . However, the function of HERP in the HRD1 dislocation machinery is not understood.
 Experiments in S. cerevisiae, where mammalian HERP complements, at least partially, some of the functions of Usa1p in the null mutant, imply that HERP might be the functional equivalent of yeast Usa1p (Carvalho et al., 2006) . Usa1p acts as a scaffold that promotes assembly, maintains the integrity, and activates the ubiquitylation activity of the Hrd1p dislocon (Carroll and Hampton, 2010; Carvalho et al., 2006; Horn et al., 2009; Kanehara et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2009) .
 The short half-life distinguishes HERP from most ER-resident proteins, whose turnover is slow (Cambridge et al., 2011; Price et al., 2010) . The peculiar instability of HERP compared to the stability of the other components of the HRD1 dislocation machinery, which are characterized by half-lives exceeding 30 hr, also violates the rule asserting that turnover rates of constituent subunits of multimeric complexes often fall within a small range (Cambridge et al., 2011; Price et al., 2010) . Altogether, these observations led us to hypothesize that regulated HERP R E T R A C T E D turnover could set the activity of the ERAD machinery by determining the integrity of HRD1 dislocons.
 Our analysis of endogenous HRD1 dislocons in cells expressing tunable levels of folding-defective HRD1 clients revealed an unexpected dynamicity of these supramolecular complexes. We report that HRD1 dislocons and the scaffold protein HERP are unstable when not engaged by clients. The constitutively rapid turnover of endogenous HERP is regulated by the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC6e, the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF5, the p97/UFD1 complex, and the 26S proteasome. Expression of HRD1 clients stabilizes HRD1 dislocons and delays, in a dose-dependent manner, turnover of endogenous HERP by inhibiting its RNF5-dependent recognition and polyubiquitylation. These findings highlight a mechanism of autoadaptive ERAD, where the integrity of dislocation machineries directly depends on the ER load with folding-defective clients.
 The Constitutive HERP Turnover Is Regulated by UBC6e, RNF5, UFD1, p97, and the 26S Proteasome Unlike other components of the HRD1 dislocon, such as HRD1, SEL1L, DER1, AUP1, UBXD2, BAP31, ERLIN1, ERLIN2, and others (Cambridge et al., 2011; Christianson et al., 2012) , endogenous HERP has a much shorter half-life regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) (t 1/2 of about 60 min; Figures 1A, lanes 1-5, and 1B) (Hori et al., 2004; Miura et al., 2010; Sai et al., 2003) . Consistently, HERP turnover was substantially inhibited upon inactivation of 26S proteasomes with PS-341 and remained unaffected upon cell exposure to lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine (Figures 1A, lanes 6 and 7, respectively, and 1B).
 To identify the components of the UPS involved in HERP turnover, we first monitored variations in the intracellular level and in the half-life of endogenous HERP upon silencing of select ER membrane-embedded E3 ubiquitin ligases. Individual silencing of HRD1, gp78, RNF103, or RNF166 or combined silencing of HRD1 and gp78 (Figures 2A, S1A , and S1B available online) did not significantly alter the intracellular level (Figures 2A, lanes 1 -4, 6, and 7, and 2B) Figures 2A, 2C , and 2E) remained unchanged upon RNF5 silencing.
 To identify the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme participating in the constitutive, RNF5-regulated turnover of HERP, we silenced the expression of UBC7, which has a reported role in ERAD (Webster et al., 2003) , and UBC6e, the RNF5-associated E2 enzyme (Younger et al., 2006) . As a positive control, the silencing of RNF5 with three different siRNAs substantially increased the intracellular level of endogenous HERP (Figures 2E, lanes 2-4, and 2F). While the downregulation of UBC7 had no effect (Figures 2E, lane 5, 2F, and S1C), the silencing of UBC6e with two different siRNAs substantially raised the level of HERP (Figures 2E, lanes 6 and 7, and 2F). Likewise, HERP levels substantially increased upon silencing of UFD1, which selectively recruits polyubiquitylated polypeptides to the p97 segregase (Ye et al., 2001 ) (Figures 2E, lane 9, 2F, and S1D-S1F), or upon cell incubation with N 2 ,N 4 -dibenzylquinazoline-2,4-diamine (DBeQ), which selectively inactivates p97 (Figures S1E and S1F) (Chou et al., 2011) .
 Consistent with the involvement of the UPS in the turnover of endogenous HERP, cell exposure to the proteasomal inhibitor PS-341 caused the accumulation of polyubiquitylated HERP ( Figure 2G , lane 2 versus 1, refer to Experimental Procedures) (Sai et al., 2003) . Silencing of RNF5 ( Figure 2G , lane 3) or UBC6e (lane 4) reduced the amount of polyubiquitylated HERP upon proteasomal inactivation, thus confirming RNF5 and UBC6e intervention in the rapid constitutive clearance of endogenous HERP from the mammalian ER.
 As an additional indication of the role of RNF5 in the regulation of constitutive HERP turnover, coprecipitation analysis revealed a direct association between RNF5 and HERP at steady state (Figures 2H, first panel, lane 1, and S2A). Significantly, expression of the folding-defective protein Null Hong Kong (NHK), a client of the HRD1 dislocation machinery engaging HERP for efficient clearance from the ER ( Figures S3 and S4A ) (Kny et al., 2011) , dose-dependently inhibited the RNF5:HERP interaction that regulates HERP turnover ( Figure 2H , first panel) and dosedependently favored HERP:HRD1 (second panel), HERP:SEL1L (fourth panel), and HRD1:SEL1L (fifth panel) interactions as an indication that engagement by clients stabilizes HRD1 dislocons, thereby protecting HERP from RNF5-controlled turnover.
 Selective, Transcription-Independent Raise in Endogenous HERP Protein Levels in Cells Expressing a Folding-Defective HRD1 Client Expression of a client of the HRD1 dislocation machinery, the folding-defective protein NHK, inhibits HERP recognition by RNF5, the E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the rapid, constitutive HERP turnover ( Figure 2 ). We hypothesized that as a direct consequence, NHK expression might stabilize endogenous HERP engaged in the HRD1 dislocon. This could have important consequences on the activity of the HRD1 pathway since, at least in yeast, it has been shown that the HERP ortholog Usa1p regulates the integrity and the activity of the HRD1 dislocation machinery controlling misfolded protein clearance from the ER lumen (Carroll and Hampton, 2010; Carvalho et al., 2006; Horn et al., 2009; Kanehara et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2009) .
 NHK is a soluble, folding-defective polypeptide. It is classified as an ERAD-L S substrate ( Figure S3 ), and its clearance from the ER stringently relies on engagement of the HRD1 pathway (Ber- (H) HERP:RNF5, HERP:HRD1, HERP:SEL1L, and HRD1:SEL1L complexes were monitored in cells expressing increasing amount of NHK (induction with 10-100 ng/ml tetracycline for 5 hr). Endogenous HERP (panels 1-3) or SEL1L (panels 4-6) was immunoisolated from lysates, and the associated endogenous RNF5, HRD1, or HERP was revealed by western blot. Please note that the samples for the anti-HERP immunoprecipitations have been normalized (third panel). TCE, total cell extract. Error bars: SD from the mean of three replicates. nasconi et al., 2010a). ERAD-L S substrates are delivered to the ER membrane by the ERAD lectins OS-9 and XTP3-B (Bernasconi et al., 2008; Christianson et al., 2008; Hosokawa et al., 2008) and are retrotranslocated into the cytosol for proteasomal degradation by the HRD1 dislocon comprising HERP, the adaptor SEL1L, and the rhomboid pseudoprotease DER1 (Bernasconi et al., 2010a; Christianson et al., 2008; Greenblatt et al., 2011; Kny et al., 2011) . All in all, NHK is a bona fide client of the HRD1 pathway that relies on HERP for efficient disposal from the ER (Figures S4A, lanes 1-6, and S4B) (Kny et al., 2011) .
 The analysis of a human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line characterized by tetracycline-inducible expression of NHK ( Figure 3A , first panel) revealed early responses to expression of the folding-defective transgene consisting of the selective raise of endogenous HERP levels (Figures 3A, second panel, and 3B, white columns). The induction of NHK expression did not affect the protein level of the two conventional ER stress markers BiP and GRP94 or of other components of the HRD1 Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the accumulation of the HERP protein upon NHK induction could not be ascribed to the activation of transcriptional UPR programs. In fact, the levels of HERP, BiP, and GRP94 transcripts did not increase (Figure 3C) , and variations in Xbp1 splicing were not observed (Figure 3A) . This early response to expression of NHK consisting of the elevation of HERP protein levels in the absence of transcriptional induction anticipated the induction of the UPR. In fact, induction of HERP, BiP, and GRP94 transcription did occur upon prolonged expression of higher concentrations of NHK ( Figures 3D-3F ) or when cells were subjected to widespread stress stimuli such as exposure to tunicamycin for 5 hr (Figures 3A, lane 7, 3B, and 3C).
 Since NHK inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, the recognition of HERP by the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF5, which controls polyubiquitylation and constitutive turnover of HERP ( Figure 2H ), we predicted that the transcription-independent raise of HERP protein in cells expressing NHK resulted from a client-induced delay of the constitutively rapid HERP turnover. To verify this, the half-life of endogenous HERP was monitored by cycloheximide (CHX) chase in cells incubated for 5 hr in the absence Figure 4A , lanes 1-4) or in the presence of tetracycline to induce NHK expression (lanes 5-8). Western blot analysis of the cell lysates showed that in cells expressing NHK, the HERP turnover was substantially slower (t 1/2 > 120 min; Figures 4A, second panel, lanes 5-8, and 4E, NHK) than in cells not expressing the HRD1 client (t 1/2 of 60 min; Figures 4A, second panel, lanes 1-4, and 4E, mock). Confirming the data shown in Figure 3 , the NHK-induced delay in HERP turnover did increase the intraluminal level of the endogenous protein so that at steady state, the level of endogenous HERP in cells expressing NHK was 1.7 times higher than that in cells not expressing NHK (Figures 4A, second panel, lanes 5 versus 1, and 4E, NHK versus mock), and after a 90 min CHX chase it was 4 times higher ( Figure 4E , NHK versus mock). Similar results were obtained in cells expressing k-LC ( Figure S5 ), another HERP/HRD1 client (Okuda-Shimizu and Hendershot, 2007) .
 NHK BACE displays the same luminal misfolded domain of NHK, but it is anchored at the ER membrane (i.e., it is an ERAD-L M substrate, Figure S3 ). Anchorage of ERAD substrates at the membrane renders them more promiscuous in the engagement of ERAD pathways for efficient disposal (Bernasconi et al., 2010a; 2010b; Ninagawa et al., 2011) . Consistent with a less stringent engagement of the HRD1 pathway, silencing of HERP expression did not significantly affect NHK BACE degradation ( Figures S4C and S4D Figures  4C, 4E , and S3) or cell exposure to tetracycline, which is used to induce transgene expression ( Figures 4D and 4E) , did not affect HERP stability or levels.
 Altogether, these data reveal that HRD1 clients elicit an autoadaptive regulatory response that anticipates UPR induction to rapidly enhance the intracellular level of HERP by stabilizing its association with components of the HRD1 dislocon, thereby inhibiting its UPS-regulated constitutive turnover.
 The yeast ortholog Usa1p regulates assembly and activity of the HRD1 dislocon (Carroll and Hampton, 2010; Carvalho et al., 2006; Horn et al., 2009; Kanehara et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2009) . Usa1p-and HERP-containing complexes can be analyzed in sedimentation gradients (Carvalho et al., 2006; Horn et al., 2009; Iida et al., 2011; Kny et al., 2011) . Since NHK expression delays the turnover of endogenous HERP, thus increasing its intracellular level (Figures 3 and 4) , we next verified whether expression of this misfolded HRD1 client affects the stability of the pool of endogenous HERP participating in the supramolecular complexes dedicated to ERAD substrate dislocation across the ER membrane.
 To this end, we set up a protocol for differential sedimentation of endogenous HERP excluded from or included into the HERP-SEL1L-HRD1-DER1 dislocon in cells expressing or not expressing NHK. HEK293 cells were lysed in CHAPS, a zwitterionic detergent that preserves multimeric protein complexes. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble fraction of the cell lysates was loaded at the top of a linear R E T R A C T E D sucrose gradient (10%-60%; Figures 5, S6 , and S7, and Experimental Procedures). After sample ultracentrifugation, 10 fractions were collected from the top (the position of sedimentation markers is shown in Figure 5A ). Western blot analysis showed that the ERAD substrate NHK was mainly distributed in fractions 2-4 and 10. Endogenous HERP and SEL1L were separated in three major pools sedimenting in fractions 2-4, 7-8, and 10. HRD1 was in two major pools in fractions 7-8 and 10. DER1 and RNF5 were mostly found in fraction 10, and CNX was mostly found in fractions 2-4 ( Figure 5A ).
 Containing the HRD1 Client NHK Immunoisolation of NHK from the sucrose gradient fractions ( Figure 5B ) and detection of the interacting proteins by western blot showed that in fractions 2-4, NHK was physically associated with CNX, an ER-resident lectin chaperone that assists folding-defective polypeptides during the unsuccessful attempts to attain the native structure (Molinari et al., 2002) , but not with endogenous HERP and SEL1L sedimenting in the same fractions ( Figures 5A and 5B ). In contrast, NHK in fraction 10 was in large complexes containing all major components of the HRD1 dislocation machinery, as shown by the presence of HERP, SEL1L, HRD1, DER1, and NHK in the same immunocomplexes ( Figures  5B and 5C ). RNF5 does not participate in the HRD1 dislocon complex (Christianson et al., 2012) . Consistently, it did not coprecipitate with the HRD1 client NHK ( Figure 5B ) or with other components of the HRD1 dislocon coimmunoisolated from fraction 10 ( Figure 5C ). Altogether, these data and the fact that NHK accumulated in fraction 10 upon inhibition of proteasomal activity ( Figure 5D ) led us to conclude that this fraction contains active dislocons engaged by HRD1 clients for retrotranslocation across the ER membrane. Incomplete dislocons lacking DER1 and NHK ( Figures 5B and 5C ), as well as the HERP:RNF5 complexes whose formation regulates the constitutively fast turnover of HERP ( Figures 2H and S6A) , sediment in lighter fractions of the sucrose gradients (i.e., fractions 6-8).
 In S. cerevisiae, Usa1p ensures the clustering of Hrd1p/Hrd3p/ Der1p-containing oligomers in higher-order functional complexes (Carvalho et al., 2010; Horn et al., 2009) . Consistent with evolutionary conservation of this function in the mammalian system, silencing HERP expression (siHERP; Figure S6B ) caused a sedimentation shift of SEL1L-, HRD1-, and DER1-containing complexes from fraction 10 (Figures 5A-5C and S6D; for cells treated with a scrambled small interfering RNA [siSCR]) to fractions 7 and 8 ( Figures 5E, S6D , and S6F; siHERP). This corresponds to a reduction in HRD1 dislocon size from more than 2,000 kDa (>26S) to approximately 700 kDa (19S). As reported for yeast, such a reduction cannot be explained by the absence of HERP alone. Consistently, DER1 silencing (Figure S6C) , which does not affect clustering of Hrd1 dislocons in (E) Same as in (C) in siHERP cells not expressing NHK. (F) Same as in (E) in siDER1 cells. Analysis of the gradients has been repeated 6, 3, 2, 2, 2, and 2 times, respectively. (Horn et al., 2009) , did not significantly change the sedimentation of complexes containing HERP, SEL1L, and HRD1 ( Figures 5F and S6D, siDER1) . Upon HERP silencing, NHK did not sediment in fraction 10 ( Figure S6E , to be compared with NHK distribution in the sucrose gradient of wild-type cell extracts in Figure 5B ), it did not associate with components of fragmented HRD1 dislocons in fractions 7-9 ( Figures S6E and S6F versus Figures 5B and 5C) , and its disposal from the ER was substantially delayed (Figures S4A and S4B) .
 Expression of the HRD1 Client NHK Specifically Stabilizes HERP and the HRD1 Dislocon HERP is subjected to constitutively rapid turnover, which is delayed upon luminal expression of the HRD1 client NHK (Figures 3 and 4) . In sucrose gradients, only endogenous HERP sedimenting in fraction 10 is engaged in complexes with all major components of the HRD1 dislocation machinery and with the HRD1 client to be dislocated across the ER membrane ( Figure 5 ). To test whether HRD1 clients stabilize HERP in the HRD1 dislocon, the turnover of the pool of endogenous HERP excluded from the HRD1 dislocon (fraction 2) was compared with the turnover of HERP engaged in the active HRD1 dislocation machinery (fraction 10). A CHX chase analysis revealed that the pool of endogenous HERP in fraction 2 was relatively stable (35% decay in 45 min; Figures 6A, first panel, lanes 1 versus 3, and 6B , mock, white column). The decay of this pool of HERP was not affected upon induction of NHK expression ( Figures 6A, second panel,  lanes 1 versus 3, and 6B , NHK, gray column). In contrast, the pool of endogenous HERP engaged in the HRD1 dislocon (fraction 10) was unstable at steady state (65% decay in 45 min; Figures 6A, first panel, lanes 2 versus 4, and 6B , mock, white column) and was substantially stabilized upon expression of NHK (only 25% decay in 45 min; Figures 6A, second panel, lanes 2  versus 4, and 6B , NHK, gray column). Consistent with a clientinduced stabilization of endogenous HERP in the HRD1 dislocon, the level of HERP in fraction 10 relative to the free pool in fraction 2 substantially increased upon induction of NHK expression ( Figures 6A, lane 2, first versus second panel, and 6C) .
 In contrast to HERP, the other components of the HRD1 dislocon are stable proteins (Cambridge et al., 2011) . Consistently, the intracellular levels of SEL1L and HRD1 that have half-lives of 26 and 37 hr, respectively ( Figure S7A ) (Cambridge et al., 2011) , did not change during the 45 min of chase of the experiment shown in Figure 6A . Nevertheless, the fraction of SEL1L and HRD1 in the active dislocons sedimenting in fraction 10 was reduced by 35% and 50%, respectively, during a 45 min chase (Figures 6A, third and fifth panel, lanes 4 versus 2, and 6B, SEL1L and HRD1, white columns) and even more after longer CHX chase that fully depletes endogenous HERP (180 min in Figure S7B ). Under these conditions, the HRD1 dislocons disassemble, and the sedimentation of SEL1L-, HRD1-, and DER1-containing complexes shifted from fraction 10 (>2,000 kDa/26S; Figure S7B ) to fractions 7-8, corresponding to an approximate size of 700 kDa/19S ( Figure S7B ). Based on these data, the half-life of HRD1 dislocation machineries can be estimated to be less than 60 min at steady state.
 Induction of expression of the HRD1 client NHK, shown above to stabilize HERP, also stabilized the dislocon machinery, as shown by the persistency of SEL1L and HRD1 in the large complexes sedimenting in fraction 10 (Figures 6A, fourth and sixth panels, lanes 4 versus 2, and 6B, SEL1L and HRD1, gray columns). This is consistent with a model in which the engagement of HRD1 dislocons by clients maintains their integrity and stabilizes HERP, thus insuring autoadaptive mechanisms that allow rapid and client-specific adjustments of ERAD activity to variations in misfolded polypeptide load in the ER lumen.
 Mammalian cells deploy a constitutive ERAD activity that must cope with the physiologic byproducts of protein biogenesis, generated by the intrinsic inefficiency of protein folding programs in the ER lumen. This study reveals an autoadaptive mechanism whereby the ERAD machinery rapidly responds to fluctuations in misfolded clients to be dislocated across the ER membrane for proteasomal degradation. The response consists Figure 6 .

Error bars: SD from the mean of two replicates.
 of a client-induced stabilization of HRD1 dislocons and of HERP, a crucial regulator of HRD1 dislocon assembly and activity (Figure 7) . Both the dislocons and HERP are intrinsically unstable when not engaged by misfolded polypeptides. We propose that autoadaptive ERAD is the first line of defense to contrast accumulation of misfolded polypeptides, preceding and possibly preventing activation of transcriptional UPR programs.
 Cumulative data highlight the role of misfolded polypeptides in directly determining ERAD activity (the ERAD tuning model; Bernasconi and Molinari, 2011; Leitman et al., 2013; Merulla et al., 2013) . For example, misfolded polypeptides may act as preferred acceptors for the ubiquitylating activity of membrane-embedded E3 ubiquitin ligases, thereby competing with the heterologous ubiquitylation and self-ubiquitylation shown to constitutively clear from the ER membrane or inactivate E3 ubiquitin ligases such as SURF1, RFP2, and gp78 (Ballar et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2011; Lerner et al., 2007; Shmueli et al., 2009; Weissman et al., 2011) . Moreover, folding-defective clients of specific ERAD pathways may specifically ensure maintenance of the integrity of functional ERAD complexes (Bernasconi et al., 2012a; Calì et al., 2008; Nakatsukasa et al., 2013; Reggiori et al., 2010) and of supramolecular dislocation machineries (this study). By inhibiting the disassembly that occurs when dislocation machineries are unengaged (this study), misfolded proteins may also inhibit the segregation of ERAD factors such as SEL1L, EDEM1, and OS-9 in ER-derived vesicles or in ER subdomains (Bernasconi et al., 2012a; Calì et al., 2008) . Interestingly, these ER-derived subdomains are eventually coopted by arteritis and coronaviruses to become platforms for viral genome replication as an indication that ERAD tuning pathways might be hijacked by pathogens to promote infection (Bernasconi et al., 2012b; Monastyrska et al., 2013; Reggiori et al., 2010) . Finally, misfolded polypeptides have been shown to interfere with the polyubiquitylation of the membrane protein JAMP, thereby promoting recruitment of 26S proteasomes at the ER membrane (Tcherpakov et al., 2009) . In all of these ERAD tuning responses, the expression of misfolded polypeptides enhances ERAD activity directly and immediately. We propose that only when autoadaptive ERAD capacity is overwhelmed by the misfolded protein load might the consequent perturbations in the ER folding environment possibly decoded by the luminal reduction of free BiP activate the conventional UPR, causing ER swelling, enhanced synthesis of ER-resident folding and degradation regulators, and attenuation of cargo proteins production. We speculate that the avidity of the given misfolded polypeptide for BiP may determine the threshold for UPR activation. In other words, substrates with a high capacity for BiP binding may elicit the transition between ERAD tuning response and transcriptional UPR at lower expression levels than polypeptides that bind less BiP.
 ERAD tuning responses are more rapidly triggered than UPR, whose onset has a latency of several hours (Pincus and Walter, 2012; Walter and Ron, 2011) , and are more readily reversible. Their reversibility relies in fact on the reactivation of the constitutively rapid turnover, removal from the ER, and/or removal from functional ERAD complexes of select ERAD factors that occurs at low doses of misfolded polypeptides when dislocons are empty and are, at least partly, disassembled. In contrast, the recovery from a UPR requires activation of elusive mechanisms that reduce the size of the ER after the UPR-triggered expansion and that remove the excess of chaperones produced during the ER stress phase, most of which have half-lives exceeding 24 hr (Cambridge et al., 2011) .
 The ER membrane contains at least 24 RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligases (Neutzner et al., 2011) . Few of them have a (Bernasconi et al., 2012a) . HRD1 dislocons are unstable when not engaged by clients. As a consequence, the linchpin protein HERP is degraded by the action of UBC6e, RNF5, p97, and the 26S proteasome. (B) Misfolded polypeptides affect ERAD tuning mechanisms to boost ERAD activity. Expression of HRD1 clients recruits and stabilizes the HRD1 dislocons by interfering with the RNF5-dependent HERP recognition and removal. The increased stability of HERP stabilizes, in turn, the whole HRD1 dislocation machinery. RING, really interesting new gene finger domain (catalytic domain); ULD, ubiquitin-like domain.
 Autoadaptive ERAD and ERAD Tuning documented role in the clearance of aberrant gene products from the ER, are engaged by misfolded polypeptides with different physicochemical features, and enter supramolecular complexes with specific composition that, in some cases, share common components (Brodsky and Wojcikiewicz, 2009; Christianson et al., 2012; Merulla et al., 2013) . The organization of ERAD as a dynamic network of interacting functional modules that efficiently cope with the production of diverse classes of misfolded polypeptides has been proposed (Christianson et al., 2012) . It is a matter of further investigations to understand whether the client-dependent regulation mechanisms shown to operate for the HRD1 pathway also exist to regulate other dislocation machineries and other ERAD pathways. If this is the case, one could envision that cellular proteostasis is not maintained by pleiotropic and/or nonspecific adaptations of ERAD activity to the compartmental load with misfolded cargo. Rather, selective activation of dedicated pathways and assembly of the relevant modules would allow rapid and specific responses to the species of aberrant gene products that cells are challenged with. We suggest that defective ''ERAD elasticity'' (i.e., the reduced capacity to efficiently cope with fluctuations in misfolded polypeptide load by activating ERAD tuning responses that preempt UPR induction) could be a reason for increased sensitivity to misfolded protein load in aging cells and tissues, possibly resulting in the onset and/or progression of conformational diseases.
 Cell Lines, CHX Chase, RNAi, and Flp-In T-REx HEK293 Inducible Cell Line HEK293 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) or in modified Eagle's medium alpha (MEMa), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For HERP turnover analysis, cells at 80%-90% confluence were incubated with 50 mg/ml CHX (Sigma) for the indicated times. At the end of the chase, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (2% CHAPS [Anatrace] in HEPES-buffered saline [HBS; pH 6.8], 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide, and protease inhibitors). Proteins of interest were detected by western blot as explained below. For siRNA-based interference, HeLa or HEK293 cells at 50% confluence in a 3.5 cm tissue culture plate were transfected with siRNA duplex (from QIAGEN or Ambion; 50 pmol/dish; Table S1A) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Experiments were performed 48 hr after transfection. Stable inducible HEK293 cells expressing the gene of interest have been generated using the Flp-In T-REx system (Invitrogen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Transgene expression was induced by supplementing the cell culture medium with 0-100 ng/ml tetracycline (Sigma) as specified for each figure.
 The following antibodies were used: CNX, gp78, HRD1, RNF5, and UBC6e (kind gifts of A. Helenius, S. Fang, R. Wojcikiewicz, Z. Ronai, and H. Ploegh, respectively); HERP (Kokame et al., 2000) ; HA, DER1, HERP, RNF5, and SEL1L (Sigma); ERp72, KDEL (Stressgen); actin (Santa Cruz); tubulin (Applied Biological Materials); ubiquitin (DAKO). PS-341 (Millennium Pharmaceuticals), CQ, DBeQ, and CHX (Sigma) have been used at final concentrations of 10 mM, 100 mM, 10 or 15 mM, and 50 mg/ml, respectively.
 Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitations, Western Blots, and Analysis of Data HeLa or HEK293 cells were pulsed with 0.05 mCi [ 35 S]methionine/cysteine mix and chased for the indicated times with DMEM supplemented with 5 mM cold methionine and cysteine. Postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was prepared by solubilization of cells in lysis buffer. Native immunoprecipitations were performed by adding protein A beads (Sigma; 1:10, w/v swollen in 50 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl [HBS] ) with the select antibody and incubated for 2 hr at 4 C. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed (3 times for 10 min each) with 0.5% CHAPS in HBS, resuspended in sample buffer, incubated at 65 C for 10 min, and finally separated in SDS-PAGE. To assess the polyubiquitylation level of HERP, HERP-containing complexes were disrupted by lysing cells with RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed with 0.5% Triton in HBS. Protein transfer was performed with the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). Western blots were performed using the SNAP i.d. system (Millipore). The Luminata Forte ECL detection system was from Millipore, and signals were detected using ImageQuant LAS 4000 system (GE Healthcare, Life Sciences). Quantifications using the MultiGauge analysis software were performed in the linear range of the western blot signal ( Figure S2B ).
 Semiquantitative and Quantitative RT-PCR Total RNA was isolated using the GenElute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. A total of 2 mg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase and Oligo(dT) (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) with transcript-specific primers (Table S1B ). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System. The PCR reactions were performed using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The housekeeping gene b-actin was used as reference. Data were analyzed using the SDS 2.2.2 software.
 Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation HEK293 cells in a 6 cm dish were solubilized in 0.4 ml lysis buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. PNS was collected and applied to a 10%-60% linear sucrose gradient (in 2% CHAPS-HBS [pH 6.8]) prepared with a Gradient Master BioComp. Separation of the intracellular protein complexes was performed by ultracentrifugation in a MLS-50 rotor (16 hr, 157,000 3 g, 4 C). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected from the top. Standards are as follows: BSA (66 kDa, 4.6S), b-amylase (200 kDa, 8.9S), and porcine thyroid thyroglobulin (669 kDa, 19S). For immunoprecipitations, fractions were diluted 53 with lysis buffer.
 Independent experiments were quantified, analyzed with the Prism 5 software, and plotted as the mean ± SD.

In vitro transport studies of the maximally injured region, the midjejunum (80% reduction in lactase), surprisingly, showed transport responses to u-glutamine (30 mmoFL) and L-alanine (30 mmol/L) that were similar qualitatively and quantitatively to those observed in control tissue. Glutamine is a potentially useful substrate for investigation in oral rehydration solutions for infant diarrhea. V iral enteritis is the leading cause of diarrhea in infants and toddlers less than 2 years old (1) . In the current study, we characterized the intestinal response to L-glutamine in piglet rotavirus enteritis, a naturally occurring disease of major importance in newborn swine. Experiments were designed to prevent sow-acquired rotavirus infection. Piglets were reared in individual feed-ing cages and fed artificial formula (13) . Cross-bred sows in a barrier-intact intensive care farrowing facility were washed with povidone-iodine before delivery. The first 10 cm of proximal jejunum, a 20-cm segment obtained at the midpoint of the small intestine, and the distal 10 cm of terminal ileum were removed and placed in oxygenated Ringer's buffer; three 10-cm segments were scraped and homogenized for enzyme assays, as described bel6w. Jejunum for transport studies was drawn over a plastic rod, incised longitudinally, and stripped of muscu-laris propria. Potential difference (PD) across the tissue was measured by calomel electrodes in saturated KC1, attached to agar bridges (4 g/dL, made up in Ringer's buffer) positioned near the surface of the tissue. Clamps introduced current to half-calls through Ag-AgCI electrodes which were connected to the chambers via agar bridges. Chambers were paired so that tissue conductance did not differ by more than 25%, and data were discarded if conductance in a chamber pair differed by more than 25% during the experiment. Ci) were added to either the mucosal or serosal reservoir. At 100 minutes, D-glucose (30 mmoUL) was added to both the mucosal and serosal baths, and Isc was determined for a subsequent 20-minute period. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used on matched flux data pairs to assess the significance of the mean flux increments. Results of the tests are expressed as P values. All unlabeled chemicals were obtained from Sigma, St. Louis, MO. These studies were approved by the University of North Carolina Animal Care Committee. Five piglets vomited once 2-3 days after inoculation, just before the onset of the diarrhea. High titer excretion (3+-4+ scores) occurred in 12 of 13 pigs. Fecal excretion of rotavirus, in two cases, resolved and later recurred. Only one animal was not excreting virus at the time of death. Viral cytopathic effect was most prominent in the villus tips. Although lactase specific activity appeared reduced, the difference between control and infected animals was not statistically significant. Thymidine kinase activity was increased sevenfold. Thymidine kinase, in all parts of the bowel, peaked at 2-7 days after inoculation but remained elevated even in animals killed as late as 16 days after inoculation. Figure 3 shows thymidine kinase activities from homogenates of the midjejunum. There was an increase in J,~, which could represent increased flux across the paracellular pathway and/or stimulation of a transcellular Na ÷ secretory process. L-alanine, in rotavirus-damaged tissues, stimulated net Na ÷ flux (2.7 p. cm -2 • h -~) while not signifi-cantly altering net C1-flux. However, response in controls exceeded response in the rotavirus-infected group by more than twofold (P < 0.05). Our studies of swine rotavirus enteritis in newborn artificially reared piglets are consistent with the findings in other piglet enteridites (coronavirus and TGE enteritis, human rotavirus enteritis in conventional pigs (20) , and porcine rotavirus enteritis in gnotobiotic piglets (21)). Infant mice infected with rotavirus appear to develop a much milder lesion (22, 23) . As in our previous studies of piglet TGE (4,5), we found no differences in basal ion transport, comparing rotavirus-infected with normal jejunum. Glutamine stimulates Na ÷ transport in newborn piglet proximal jejunum primarily by an electroneutral, rather than electrogenic Na÷-coupled mechanism (12) ; serosal glutamine, we have found, will also increase NaC1 transport (12) . Although we have consistently observed a NaC1 absorptive response to glutamine, whether it is added to the mucosal or serosal sides of the tissue, we have shown that C1-absorption does not increase after mucosal phenylalanine or glucos.e. They speculated that jejunal epithelial cell NaC1 absorption may be absent in severe viral enteritis. found that oxidation of labeled glutamine to CO2 was increased 75% in cells at the crypt neck compared with villus or crypt cells (29) . Oral rehydration therapy (ORT), one of the major medical advances of the century, is believed to promote gut absorption because of the high concentrations of both glucose and Na ÷, substrates which are transported in a coupled manner across the brush border (19) ."

 Stromal cells generate a complex cellular scaffold that provides specialized microenvironments for lymphocyte activation in secondary lymphoid organs. Here, we assessed whether local activation of stromal cells in the central nervous system (CNS) is mandatory to transfer immune recognition from secondary lymphoid organs into the infected tissue. We report that neurotropic virus infection in mice triggered the establishment of such stromal cell niches in the CNS. CNS stromal cell activation was dominated by a rapid and vigorous production of CCmotif chemokine receptor (CCR) 7 ligands CCL19 and CCL21 by vascular endothelial cells and adjacent fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC)-like cells in the perivascular space. Moreover, CCR7 ligands produced by CNS stromal cells were crucial to support recruitment and local re-activation of antiviral CD8 + T cells and to protect the host from lethal neuroinflammatory disease, indicating that CNS stromal cells generate confined microenvironments that control protective T cell immunity.","Whether CNS stromal cells regulate protective T cell immunity is unclear. Ludewig and colleagues demonstrate that local chemokine production by activated endothelial and fibroblastic stromal cells is required to transfer protective CD8 + T cell immunity from the draining lymph node to virus-infected areas of the central nervous system.
 Successful adaptive immune responses against pathogens rely on the activation of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) and the recruitment of effector cells to sites of pathogen replication . Within SLOs, appropriately stimulated fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) generate a cellular scaffold that maintains immune responsiveness , for example through fostering dendritic cell-T cell interaction (Bajé noff et al., 2006) or supporting B cell activation (Cremasco et al., 2014) . Other SLO stromal cells such as blood endothelial cells (BECs) of high endothelial venules (HEVs) regulate SLO cellularity via stringent control of lymphocyte migration (Browning et al., 2005; Mionnet et al., 2011; Onder et al., 2013) . The establishment of different cellular compartments within SLOs is mediated to a large extent through the generation of homeostatic chemokines such as the chemokine CC-motif receptor 7 (CCR7) ligands CCL19 and CCL21 (Randall et al., 2008; Fö rster et al., 2008) . Podoplanin (PDPN)-and extracellular matrix protein ER-TR7-expressing FRCs represent a major lymph node (LN) stromal cell population involved in the production of CCR7 ligands (Link et al., 2007; Scandella et al., 2008) . In addition, BECs in HEVs and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) contribute to production of CCL21 (Gunn et al., 1998) . Moreover, CCR7 ligands can be generated in peripheral, non-lymphoid organs (Christopherson et al., 2003; Lo et al., 2003; Krumbholz et al., 2007; Columba-Cabezas et al., 2003; Kivisä kk et al., 2004) where their expression further increases during inflammatory reactions (Pashenkov et al., 2003; Krumbholz et al., 2007; Rangel-Moreno et al., 2007; Burke et al., 2010) . These data suggest that CCR7 ligands expressed in non-lymphoid organs might serve as inducible chemoattractants to foster immune surveillance.
 Tight control of lymphocyte entry and effector function is particularly important for organs such as the CNS because immunopathological damage of this organ during active immune responses has to be kept at a minimum (Ransohoff and Engelhardt, 2012; Moseman and McGavern, 2013) . The finding that T cells migrating into the inflamed CNS express CCR7 (Alt et al., 2002) suggests that T cell entry to the CNS might be controlled via this molecule. Moreover, chronic inflammatory diseases of the CNS such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are associated with elevated CCL19 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (Pashenkov et al., 2003; Krumbholz et al., 2007) and significantly higher expression in active and inactive lesions (Krumbholz et al., 2007) . In an experimental model of MS, both CCL19 and CCL21 can be detected in ECs of inflamed venules and cells that accumulate in the perivascular space (Alt et al., 2002; Columba-Cabezas et al., 2003) . However, it has remained elusive whether local activation of fibroblastic and/or endothelial stromal cells in the CNS is required to transfer immune recognition from SLOs into the infected tissue and to what extent these processes control local immune responsiveness during virus-induced neuroinflammatory CNS disease.
 To address these questions, we utilized intranasal infection with a neurotropic coronavirus that leads to a transient encephalitis in immunocompetent animals but causes chronic demyelinating and lethal disease when the host is immunodeficient (Bergmann et al., 2006; Gil-Cruz et al., 2012) . Here, we focused on the events that take place early during establishment of the infection when viral replication has caused a rapid and more than 1,000-fold upregulation of Ccl19 and Ccl21 gene expression in the olfactory bulb. We found that two distinct stromal cell populations, i.e., ECs of meningeal and sub-meningeal venules and PDPN + ER-TR7 + FRC-like cells in the perivascular space, served as major source for CCR7 ligands. CCR7 expression on antiviral T cells was mandatory to prevent lethal neuroinflammatory disease, while provision of extra-lymphatic CCL21 ensured sufficient CD8 + T cell recruitment to and re-activation in the CNS to protect the host from severe disease. We therefore conclude that activation of CNS stromal cells is critical for optimal control of neurotropic viral infection and that this function is executed-at least partially-through the swift provision of CCR7 ligands.
 Virus Infection Viral infection of the CNS triggers activation of several inflammatory cascades including the generation of chemokines (Hosking and Lane, 2010) . To assess whether infection of mice with neurotropic viruses triggers a distinct program of stromal cell activation including expression of chemokines, we infected mice with the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 via the intranasal route. As shown in Figure 1A , infectious viral particles were first detectable in olfactory bulbs and cervical LNs (cLNs) on day 2 post infection (p.i.). By day 4, viral titers had reached peak values in olfactory bulbs and the virus had spread to distal CNS areas, including the spinal cord. After 6 days, the virus had been eliminated from draining cLNs, while clearance from CNS tissues was not achieved until day 10 ( Figure 1A ). In order to visualize viral dissemination at the peak of the infection and to identify infected cells, we analyzed paramedian sagittal sections of infected brains (day 6 p.i.) by confocal laser scanning microscopy using antibodies against the MHV nucleoprotein (MHV-N), activated microglial cells (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1/Iba-1) and neurons (neuronal nuclei, NeuN) ( Figure 1B, i) . Strong viral antigen expression was detectable in rostral regions of the brain such as the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, and the piriform cortex ( Figure 1B , i and Figure S1A ). Infected microglial cells revealed by anti-Iba-1 and anti-MHV-N co-staining, were found, for example, in the olfactory bulb ( Figure 1B , ii). Moreover, infected NeuN + neurons were detected in the anterior olfactory nucleus ( Figure 1B , iii) and aspartoacylase (ASPA)-( Figure 1B , iv) or Olig2-expressing (data not shown) oligodendrocytes staining positive for MHV-N were found in the locus coeruleus. The finding that both neurons and glial cells stained positive for MHV-N supports the notion that the virus utilizes axonal transport (Perlman et al., 1990) and cell-to-cell spread (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001 ) as means of dissemination. To assess whether the viral infection had triggered the generation of (B) Distribution of MHV infected cells visualized by staining against MHV-N, Iba-1 and NeuN on paramedian sagittal brain section (day 6 p.i.) (i); high resolution analysis of infected Iba-1 + microglial cells in olfactory bulb (ii), NeuN + neurons of the anterior olfactory nucleus (iii) and ASPA + oligodendrocytes of the locus coeruleus (iv); scale bars equal 1 mm (i) and 10 mm (ii-iv); (representative images from two experiments with four mice). (C) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of genes encoding for inducible and homeostatic chemokines and genes associated with lymphoid organogenesis in cervical lymph nodes (cLN) and olfactory bulb of infected mice (day 6 p.i.) compared to naive controls. Spatial and temporal regulation of (D) Ccl19 and (E) Ccl21 mRNA was analyzed at the indicated time points by quantitative RT-PCR. Values indicate mean ± SEM from two independent experiments (n = 4 mice per time point). See also Figure S1 . microenvironments that support lymphocyte activation, we performed quantitative RT-PCR analysis of olfactory bulb tissue at the peak of the infection. Interestingly, mRNA expression of inflammatory chemokines and several genes involved in lymphoid organogenesis such as Ltb, Ltbr, and Il7 were substantially upregulated in the infected olfactory bulb ( Figure 1C ). Likewise, expression of the homeostatic chemokines Ccl19, Ccl21, and Cxcl13 increased substantially in inflamed CNS tissue compared to naive controls ( Figure 1C ). Since the increase in relative expression of CCR7 ligands was most prominent in olfactory bulb and cLN, we reasoned that processes driving production of these chemokines in the cLN were mirrored during local inflammatory reactions in the CNS. As shown in Figures 1D and  1E , expression of both Ccl19 and Ccl21 mRNA increased roughly 1,000-fold at their peak on day 20 in the olfactory bulb and the pattern of chemokine activation in different CNS areas was accompanied by the infiltration of inflammatory cells (Figures S1B and S1C). Elevated chemokine expression was only transient and followed the resolution of the viral infection with substantially lower expression on day 20 post infection ( Figures  1D and 1E) . Thus, the presence of actively replicating virus within the CNS, particularly in the olfactory bulb as virus entry point, drives a rapid increase in transcriptional activity of Ccl19/Ccl21 genes, a process that is paralleled by infiltration of immune cells and upregulation of genes associated with stromal cell activation.
 While CCL21 decorates extracellular matrix proteins, CCL19 is rapidly internalized and degraded following binding to CCR7 (Comerford et al., 2013) . Hence, to localize CCL19-producing cells in situ, we took advantage of the recently described Ccl19-cre bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse that facilitates expression of the Cre recombinase in FRCs of secondary lymphoid organs . We crossed Ccl19-cre mice with Rosa26-eyfp mice (referred to as Ccl19 eyfp ) to label cells exhibiting Ccl19 promoter activity with the yellow fluorescent protein. Combination of this detection method with anti-CCL21 immunostaining in confocal microscopic analysis of olfactory bulb tissue of naive Ccl19 eyfp mice revealed only faint CCL21 staining and few cells that exhibited Ccl19 promoter activity ( Figure S2A ). In contrast, cells showing Ccl19-cre activity and anti-CCL21 staining were clearly detectable at day 6 post infection and were mainly confined to meningeal and sub-meningeal areas (Figures 2A and 2B , magnified in boxed areas). Nevertheless, PDPN expression, which serves as a marker for FRC activation , was strongly increased in regions of elevated CCR7 ligand production ( Figure 2B ). While mRNA expression analysis revealed rather strong induction of Cxcl13 transcript levels ( Figure 1C ), expression of CXCL13 protein was found only in very few cells ( Figures S2B and S2C ).
 High resolution microscopic analysis of day 6 olfactory bulb tissue revealed considerable EYFP expression in inflamed ECs of meningeal blood vessels ( Figure 2C , arrows). Moreover, PDPN + ER-TR7 + fibroblastic cells lined the perivascular space around meningeal blood vessels and in the subarachnoid space that surrounds blood vessels protruding into the CNS parenchyma (also known as Robin-Virchow space; Ransohoff and Engelhardt, 2012) ( Figure 2C , arrowheads). Likewise, CD31 + ECs of inflamed blood vessels in the olfactory bulb parenchyma (Figure 2D, arrows) and fibroblastic cells lining the perivascular space ( Figure 2D , arrowheads) displayed Ccl19 promoter-driven EYFP activity and CCL21 expression. Stromal cell activation with expression of CCL21 was most pronounced in the vicinity of virus-infected cells ( Figure S2D ). In addition, ECs of meningeal blood vessels ( Figure 2E , arrows) and perivascular EYFP + fibroblastic cells ( Figure 2F , arrowheads) had upregulated expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1, CD54), whereas only BECs showed weak ICAM1 expression in the absence of CNS inflammation ( Figure 2E , inlet). The numbers of EYFP-expressing cells in infected olfactory bulbs increased almost 10-fold within the first 4 days of the infection ( Figure S2E ) with a substantial expansion of both PDPN + fibroblastic and CD31 + endothelial stromal cells ( Figure S2F ). Moreover, we found that only very few of the EYFP + stromal cells expressed the proliferation marker Ki67 (data not shown), indicating that the increase in EYFP + stromal cells was a result of their activation with enhanced expression of homeostatic chemokines.
 Further flow cytometric analysis of CNS stromal cells (Figures 3A-3C) confirmed that both stromal cell populations responded to the infection with substantial upregulation of ICAM1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1, CD106) and MHC class I (Figures 3D and 3E) . Moreover, fibroblastic stromal cells from infected CNS tissue expressed substantially less CD44 molecules, while expression of markers such as CD140a and CD140b was not affected ( Figures 3D and 3E ). CCL21 expression was detectable in both stromal cell populations during the infection ( Figure 3F ), while other CNS cells such as NeuN + neurons, CD11b + macrophages and/or microglia, ASPA + oligodendrocytes, and GFAP + astrocytes did not express CCL21 at day 6 post infection ( Figure S3 ). These data indicate that two distinct stromal cell populations serve as the main source of CCR7 ligands at hotspots of neurotropic virus replication in the infected CNS.
 Lethal Neuroinflammatory CNS Disease in the Absence of CCR7 The vigorous but locally restricted activation of stromal cells with dominant production of CCL19 and CCL21 during the response to neurotropic coronavirus infection suggested that these chemokines could contribute to the control of the virus. To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether mice lacking either CCR7 or CCR7 ligand expression in SLOs display differences in their defense against neurotropic virus infection. The latter mouse strain, known as plt/plt (paucity of lymph node T cells) (Gunn et al., 1999) shows expression of the CCL21b isoform in extra-lymphatic tissues (Nakano and Gunn, 2001) . Notably, both mouse strains exhibit impaired T cell zone development in SLOs due to migration defects of DCs and lymphocytes (Gunn et al., 1999; Fö rster et al., 1999) , hence showing a comparable loss of immunocompetence in response to systemic virus infection (Junt et al., 2002; Junt et al., 2004) . While Ccr7-sufficient mice successfully controlled the infection and experienced transient weight loss during the first 2 weeks, Ccr7-deficient mice presented with rapid weight loss early after infection, succumbing to neuroinflammatory disease by day 10 ( Figure 4A ). In sharp contrast, all plt/plt mice survived the phase of transient weight loss ( Figure 4A ) and successfully controlled the infection as shown by significantly lower viral titers in brain tissues compared to Ccr7 À/À mice ( Figure 4B ). Impaired viral control of Ccr7-deficient and plt/plt mice was associated with a pronounced reduction in antiviral CD8 + T cell numbers ( Figure 4C ) and function (Figure 4D) , as well as a reduction in antiviral CD4 + T cell function ( Figure 4E ) in the whole brain on day 10 p.i. Moreover, recruitment of CD8 + T cells into the olfactory bulb was affected already on day 4 by the Ccr7-deficiency ( Figure S4A ). The lack of CCR7 almost completed abolished the appearance of interferon (IFN)g-producing antiviral CD8 + T cells in all CNS regions ( Figures  S4B and S4C ), while CD4 + T cell recruitment was affected to a lesser extent (Figures S4D and S4E) . Importantly, Ccr7-deficient mice showed a stronger impairment of antiviral CD8 + T cell responses compared to plt/plt mice ( Figures 4C and 4D ). The lack of chemokine receptor CXCR3 that binds the inflammatory chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 and that has been implicated in the regulation of T cell migration in several models of neuroinflammation (Bagai et al., 2005) , did not affect survival following intranasal MHV A59 infection ( Figure S4F ). Likewise, the absence of CXCR5, i.e., the receptor for the B cell zone cytokine CXCL13, did not increase the susceptibility of the animals to MHV CNS infection ( Figure S4G ). Therefore, it appears that the ability of T cells to sense extralymphatic expression of the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 through CCR7 plays a major role in the rapid control of neurotropic coronavirus infection.
 Rescue from Lethal Neuroinflammatory Disease by CCR7-Expressing CD8 + T Cells Viral replication kinetics and the fast disease course suggested that appropriate activation of antiviral CD8 + T cells and elimination of the highly cytopathic pathogen from the CNS is of utmost importance to prevent lethal disease. To assess the activation and migration pattern of MHV-specific CD8 + T cells in vivo, we utilized a transgenic mouse expressing a H2-K b -restricted TCR that recognizes the immunodominant epitope s598-605 of the MHV spike protein (TCR-S or Spiky). Adoptive transfer of congenic carboxy-fluorescein succimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled Spiky cells into infected recipients revealed first activation in cLNs at 72 hr p.i. followed by strong proliferation ( Figure 5A ). Interestingly, accumulation of activated, CFSE low Spiky cells in the infected CNS could be detected on day 4 at the earliest ( Figure 5B ), indicating that the cells had to undergo at least 8 rounds of proliferation in the cLN before they gained the ability to migrate to the CNS. As expected, activation of Spiky cells in cLNs resulted in downregulation of CCR7 ( Figure 5C ). Activated Spiky cells circulating in blood and those that had infiltrated the CNS expressed CCR7 ( Figure 5C ) indicating their ability to sense CCR7 ligands produced by ECs and FRC-like cells in inflamed regions of the CNS. CCR7 expression detected on CNS-infiltrating Spiky cells was comparable to polyclonal CD8 + T cells that had infiltrated different regions of the CNS ( Figure S5 ). Moreover, Spiky cells derived from cLNs, blood and the brain on days 4 and 8 post infection had downregulated CD62L ( Figure 5D ). Functional characterization of CNS-infiltrating Spiky cells revealed that these cells were fully activated effector T cells as shown by secretion of the cytokines IFN-g and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), and expression of the degranulation marker CD107a (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1, LAMP1) ( Figures 5E and 5F ). These data support the notion that access of polyfunctional effector CD8 + T cells to the CNS is important for successful elimination of the virus from this highly vulnerable tissue.
 To investigate whether CCR7 expression on virus-specific CD8 + T cells is sufficient to secure control of neurotropic virus infection, we adoptively transferred Ccr7-proficient Spiky cells into Ccr7-deficient mice and infected the recipients with MHV. Controls included adoptive transfer of sorted polyclonal CD3 + cells from Ccr7proficient or -deficient mice. As expected, Ccr7-deficient mice that had received Ccr7-deficient CD3 + cells were not protected from MHV CNS infection ( Figures  5G and 5H , open red circles), while Ccr7-proficient CD3 + T cells provided protection ( Figures 5G and 5H , gray circles). Ccr7-deficient mice receiving transfer of Ccr7-proficient Spiky CD8 + T cells showed a mild disease course and survived the infection ( Figures 5G and 5H , white circles) indicating that protection against this neurotropic viral infection depends on the ability of antiviral CD8 + T cells to respond to CCR7 ligands.
 To determine whether the effects of CCR7 ligands on CD8 + T cell performance was due to the production of CCL19 and CCL21 in the draining cLN or a consequence of the substantial generation of these chemokines in the CNS, we used transfer of Ccr7-proficient and -deficient CD8 + Spiky cells into plt/plt mice. These mice are well-suited to address this question because they lack CCL19 and CCL21 expression in lymphoid organs (Gunn et al., 1999; Nakano and Gunn, 2001) but show production of CCL21 by stromal cells in MHV-infected olfactory bulbs (Figure 6A ). To assess early CD8 + T cell activation, we transferred Ccr7-proficient or -deficient TCR Spiky cells into plt/plt mice and compared their activation status in cLNs and the brain 4 days after infection. We found that expansion and activation of antiviral CD8 + cells in cLNs was not dependent on CCR7 ( Figure 6B ). Importantly, accumulation of Ccr7-deficient TCR Spiky cells in the CNS was significantly reduced, while Ccr7proficient or -deficient Spiky cells showed comparable activation marker profiles ( Figure 6C ). By day 6 p.i., the numbers of Ccr7proficient Spiky CD8 + T cells infiltrating the CNS were still significantly higher compared to Ccr7-deficient cells ( Figure 6D) . Importantly, the presence or absence of CCR7 on antiviral CD8 + T cells did not affect their numbers in cLNs ( Figure 6E ) nor their proliferation ( Figure 6F ) or apoptosis ( Figure 6G ) in the CNS. To more closely mirror the kinetics of polyclonal CD8 + T cell activation, only very low numbers of Spiky cells (i.e., 10 4 ) that expressed CCR7 and the congenic marker Ly5.1 or were Ccr7-deficient and labeled with the Thy1.1 marker were cotransferred into plt/plt mice. During the peak of the CNS infection, i.e., at day 6, frequencies of both cell types were comparable in the draining LN ( Figures 6H and 6I) and their activation was not affected by the Ccr7-deficiency ( Figure 6J ). Again, lack of CCR7 in Spiky cells had a pronounced effect on their accumulation in the virus-infected CNS resulting in a roughly 80% reduced frequencies compared to Ccr7-proficient cells (Figures 6H and  6I ). Moreover, virus-specific, Ccr7-deficient CD8 + T cells that had reached the CNS exhibited impaired IFN-g production (Figure 6J) . These experiments show that local expression of CCR7 ligands not only supports the recruitment of virus-specific CD8 + T cells to the CNS, but is also required for the execution of their antiviral activity.
 High resolution histological analysis revealed that activated CD8 + T cells were in intimate contact with endothelial cells of inflamed meningeal blood vessels that had upregulated Ccl19 expression ( Figures 7A and 7B, arrowheads) . Moreover, CD8 + T cells were found to interact with CCL19 + PDPN + perivascular fibroblastic stromal cells ( Figures 7A and 7B, arrows) . Next, we specifically ablated CCL19-expressing stromal cells using low doses of diphtheria toxin (DT) applied to Ccl19 eyfp mice that express the DT receptor in Cre recombinase-positive cells (Ccl19 eypf/idtr ) (Buch et al., 2005; Cremasco et al., 2014) . Low dose DT treatment led to a substantial loss of EYFP + cells in the infected CNS ( Figure 7C ), but left the FRC network in the cLNs intact ( Figure 7C , inlets). Importantly, CNS-restricted ablation of EYFP + stromal cells resulted in reduced CD8 + T cell accumulation ( Figure 7D ), while CD4 + T cell recruitment was not altered ( Figure 7E ). As a consequence, CNS viral titers were significantly elevated in DT-treated Ccl19 eypf/idtr mice on day 8 p.i. (Figure 7F ). CD8 + and CD4 + T cell compartments in cLNs were not changed by the DT treatment ( Figures 7G and 7H) . Moreover, we found that the local stimulation of antiviral CD8 + T cells via CCR7 not only improved the ability of CD8 + T cells to exit meningeal blood vessels, but substantially fostered their access to infected areas in the CNS parenchyma ( Figures 7I  and 7J ). Taken together, these data show that activated CNS stromal cells are potent regulators of local antiviral CD8 + T cell activity and that this interaction depends to a large extent on the CCR7-CCR7 ligand axis.
 The CNS is considered an immunologically privileged site that becomes visible to immune effector cells under particular inflammatory conditions such as infection with neurotropic viruses (Galea et al., 2007; Moseman and McGavern, 2013) . Because the CNS is vital and highly vulnerable, immune responses against neurotropic infectious agents need to be well-controlled, i.e., the efficacy of pathogen elimination has to be high, while immunopathological damage has to be kept minimal. The present study shows that activated antiviral CD8 + T cells utilize CCR7 to optimize migration into the inflamed CNS and to control their functional activity during neurotropic viral infection. Moreover, our findings indicate that CCR7 ligands produced by vascular and perivascular stromal cells in affected CNS regions .

 Production of CCL19 and CCL21 by stromal cells in LNs and other SLOs is essential to recruit lymphocytes to these sites of immune activation and to induce adaptive immune responses (Fö rster et al., 2008) . CNS infection with a neurotropic coronavirus, as shown here, triggered a moderate and transient increase (I) Positioning of antiviral CD8 + T cells in olfactory bulb tissue in Ccr7 +/+ and Ccr7 À/À mice on day 6 post infection.

 in Ccl19 and Ccl21 gene expression in cLNs. It is possible that virus and viral products have been drained via lymphatic vessels that connect the dura to the cLNs (Aspelund et al., 2015) . Within the CNS, both ECs and perivascular FRC-like cells showed swift and substantial production of CCR7 ligands. The expression of CCR7 ligands can be induced via the ligation of the LTbR in fibroblastic and in endothelial stromal cells . Moreover, acute inflammatory mediators such as TNF can foster activation of the CCR7/ CCL19 axis (Bosè et al., 2013) . It is likely that the initial upregulation of Ccl19 and Ccl21 mRNA expression in MHV infected CNS is triggered via inflammatory cytokines such as TNF. Notably, microglial cells are a prominent source of TNF during viral encephalitis (Ghoshal et al., 2007) . Thus, infection of microglia cells, a major target cell population of MHV in the CNS, could trigger secretion of TNF that leads to the initial low-level induction of CCL19/CCL21 expression in stromal cells. With the immigration of activated, lymphotoxin-expressing T cells, as demonstrated in our study, fibroblastic and endothelial stromal cells would receive additional activating signals to change into activation mode including massive production of CCR7 ligands.
 In addition to their enhanced chemokine production, the phenotype of ECs and FRC-like cells in the affected regions adapted properties that are typical for SLO stromal cells with high level expression of adhesion molecules and upregulation of MHC class I (Malhotra et al., 2012) . Because expression of selectins and integrins by inflamed brain vessels reduces the rolling velocity of lymphocytes and permits prolonged interactions with the endothelial wall (Engelhardt, 2006) , focal activation of blood vessel ECs most likely fosters recruitment of T cells to sites of viral replication. FRC-like cells in the perivascular space in the vicinity of virus-infected areas exhibited not only elevated expression of ICAM1, and VCAM1, but also of other markers that are typical for LN FRCs including ER-TR7 and PDPN (Cremasco et al., 2014) . Importantly, ER-TR7 + reticular networks have been observed during CNS infection with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) (Kim et al., 2009) or during chronic Toxoplasma gondii infection (Wilson et al., 2009) . Thus, it is likely that brain vessel ECs and the surrounding FRC-like cells are programmed by the local inflammatory milieu to generate those structures that foster and maintain lymphocyte recruitment and activation.
 The presence of CCR7 was mandatory to protect mice from severe neuroinflammatory disease as Ccr7-deficient animals succumbed to infection in only 10 days. Notably, presence of CCR7 on virus-specific CD8 + T cells was sufficient to rescue Ccr7-deficient animals from lethal disease clearly indicating that CCR7 signaling can be decisive for optimal recruitment of activated CD8 + T cells into the inflamed CNS. Adoptive transfer experiments using Ccr7-proficient and -deficient antiviral CD8 + T cells suggested that the lack of CCR7 signals in SLOs can be compensated by other stimuli, but that focal, high-level production of CCR7 ligands at sites of peripheral inflammation is critical for both recruitment and performance of antiviral T cells. The finding that Ccr7-deficient splenic CD8 + T cells did not show impaired IFN-g production during systemic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection (Junt et al., 2004) supports our interpretation that the SLO environment guarantees sufficient immune stimulation to generate protective antiviral immunity. Interestingly, systemic Toxoplasma gondii infection of Ccr7-deficient mice leads to rapid replication of tachyzoites and dissemination to several peripheral organs including the brain (Noor et al., 2010) . It is striking that parasite infection of the CNS provokes generation of perivascular reticular fibers that are coated with CCL21 and that anti-parasitic CD8 + T cells migrate along these fibers (Wilson et al., 2009) . Because viral CNS infection efficiently triggers activation of perivascular FRC-like cells, it is reasonable to assume that the perivascular infrastructure supporting antimicrobial immunity is built by FRC-like stromal cells. As predicted by Perry and colleagues (Galea et al., 2007) these processes therefore substantially diminish immune privilege of the CNS and permit efficient immune surveillance.
 In conclusion, our study shows that the rapid generation of CCR7 ligands by stromal cells of the CNS is critical for the containment of neurotropic virus infection. The chemokines can be generated rapidly and at high levels by meningeal and sub-meningeal blood vessel ECs and perivascular FRC-like cells. Once appropriately activated, CNS stromal cells generate a confined micro-environment that permits optimal T cell recruitment and activation. It remains to be determined whether some areas in the CNS provide such T cell activation hubs in a constitutive fashion and thereby foster activation of self-reactive T cells by perivascular dendritic cells (Greter et al., 2005) . Moreover, it will be important to assess whether and how immune cells that have entered the CNS via the stromal cell-determined entry points leave the organ after the pathogen has been cleared. It is likely that the recently discovered lymphatic connection to the cLNs (Aspelund et al., 2015; Louveau et al., 2015) serve as exit points for immune cells that had accumulated in the inflamed tissue. Accordingly, dysregulation of immune cell influx versus efflux might foster self-perpetuation of focal immune cell aggregations with development of ectopic lymphoid-like structures (Pitzalis et al., 2014) . Thus, stromal cells function as critical gate-keepers for activated immune cells and neuroinflammation might be exacerbated if activation of stromal cells following resolution of CNS infection is not restrained. Further dissection of cellular and molecular mechanisms that control stromal cell activation in the CNS is warranted to delineate potential avenues for attenuation of inflammatory processes in this vulnerable organ.
 The TCR transgenic mouse strain C57BL/6N-Tg(Tcra,Tcrb)577Biat (Spiky) was generated as described previously (Nindl et al., 2012) . Ccr7 À/À , Cxcr3 À/À , Cxcr5 À/À , iDTR and plt/plt mice were obtained from the Institute for Laboratory Animal Sciences at the University of Zü rich. BAC-transgenic C57BL/6N-Tg(Ccl19-Cre)489Biat (Ccl19-Cre) mice have been previously described . C57BL/6N (B6) mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. All mice were maintained in individually ventilated cages and were used in the age of 6 to 9 weeks. Experiments were performed in accordance with federal and cantonal guidelines (Tierschutzgesetz) under the permission numbers SG09/87 and SG13/04 following review and approval by the Veterinary Office of the Canton of St. Gallen.
 Mice were infected intranasally using 5 3 10 4 pfu MHV A59. At indicated time points mice were sacrificed, organs were collected, weighed and stored at À80 C until further analysis. Virus titers were determined from homogenized organs using standard plaque assay on L929 cells.
 Single-cell suspensions from spleens were prepared by mechanical disruption of the organ and subjected to hypotonic red blood cell lysis. For in vivo proliferation, splenocytes were labeled using CFSE (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and 10 7 cells (corresponding to 1 3 10 6 CD8 + TCR transgenic T cells) were transferred intravenously (i.v.) into recipient mice. For in vivo protection and co-transfer study, CD8 + T cells or CD3 + cells from spleens were obtained using anti-CD8 or anti-CD3 MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec). For assessment of in vivo protection, recipients received 10 6 cells, while 10 5 and 10 4 cells were transferred to plt/plt mice in separate or competitive transfer assays (respectively). At twelve hours post adoptive transfer, recipient mice were infected with MHV A59.
 Mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points and immediately perfused with PBS. CNS-infiltrating lymphocytes were isolated using mechanical disruption of the organ followed by enrichment based on 70%-30% Percoll gradients (GE Healthcare) and centrifugation for 25 min at 800 3 g. For isolation of stromal cells from olfactory bulbs, the tissue was cut into small pieces, transferred into a 24-well dish filled with RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% FCS, 20 mM HEPES (all from Lonza), 1 mg/ml Collagenase Type P (Sigma-Aldrich), and 25 mg/ml DNaseI (AppliChem), and incubated at 37 C for 30 min. After enzymatic digestion, cell suspensions were washed with PBS containing 0.5% FCS and 10 mM EDTA (MACS buffer). To enrich the stromal cell fraction, we removed myelin-producing cells using 30% Percoll and 15 min centrifugation at 700 3 g followed by hematopoietic cell depletion using MACS anti-CD45 and anti-Ter119 Microbeads (Miltenyi).
 All statistical analyses were performed with Prism 4.0 (GraphPad). Data were analyzed with the unpaired Student's t test. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant.

In the second study, enterocyte migration in proximal jejunum and ileum was measured by autoradiography. Crypt-villus column height and the distance of foremost labeled cells (FLC) from crypt base were measured; in addition, to allow for changes in column height, the mean position of FLC was expressed as a percentage of column height. Migration rates were expressed as change in position of FLC per hour, and the mean enterocyte transit time (time taken for label to reach the villus tips) was calculated for each stage of the disease. Results were analyzed with Student's t-test. At 12 hr, IF appeared equally extensive in all segments, but by 24 hr it was inconsistent, patchy, and confined to occasional blunted villus tips. By electron microscopy at 12 and 24 hr and in an occasional cell in one animal at 40 hr, viral particles were seen in the brush border and in the cytoplasm of villus surface enterocytes ( Figure 5 ). Viral particles were not seen in crypt epithelium at any stage or in any tissue taken at later stages of infection. By 24 and 40 hr, sucrase activity was significantly less than in cells from controls, and thymidine kinase activity was significantly greater. The estimated time taken for foremost labeled cells to reach the villus tips was markedly reduced in both jejunum and ileum during TGE, related both to a significant increase in migration as previously indicated, and to a significant reduction in total crypt-villus column height at certain stages of infection (Table 3) . Our observations support earlier data from Pensaert et al.' They also show that infection of the ileum coincides with jejunal infection, and, therefore, it is unlikely to be a consequence of exposure to virus shed from infected upper gut. As others have noted,7 villus cells seem particularly susceptible to invasion by the TGE virus. The findings of defective differentiation and shortened life span strongly support the concept that, at the height of diarrhea, the renewed epithelium in TGE consists predominantly of immature cells.1.4·7 Clearly, the abnormalities in transport function which reflect an alterated balance between immature crypt and mature villus cells cannot be attributed directly to the presence of virus."

We The colored dots represent T cell populations that have different specificities. The intracellular IFN␥ staining for epitope-specific responses during particular viral infections are also depicted. A naive immune system is challenged with either of two heterologous viruses, LCMV or PV, and generates a T cell response to the immunodominant epitopes. These acute responses then decline but maintain the same hierarchy of immunodominant responses in the memory state. If an immune system that has been conditioned with one virus is exposed to the other heterologous virus, T cell populations that are crossreactive with the two viruses (red outlined) will expand preferentially, dominate the response, and go onto memory.
 Plasticity of Immunodominance Hierarchies. The mobilization of crossreactive memory cells into a primary an allogeneic target have shown that different regions of the same TCR can bind to two different targets (Daniel immune response can alter the immunodominance of subsequent T cell responses.

 The colored dots represent T cell populations that have different specificities. The intracellular IFN␥ staining for epitope-specific responses during particular viral infections are also depicted. The immunodominant hierarchy of antigen-specific responses is established during the peak of the CD8 T cell response to virus and remains the same during the silencing phase into memory for both LCMV and PV infection. After a heterologous virus infection, such as PV challenge of an LCMV-immune host, the LCMV-specific hierarchy is modified, the crossreactiveepitope responses (NP205) are preserved and expanded in response to PV infection, and the noncrossreactive epitope responses are reduced in number. In an LCMV-immune host, the PV-specific immunodominant hierarchy is different from that of a naive host, with the crossreactive epitope response (NP205) being immunodominant.

We report that HRD1 dislocons and the scaffold protein HERP are unstable when not engaged by clients.

Western blot analysis showed that the ERAD substrate NHK was mainly distributed in fractions 2-4 and 10. DER1 and RNF5 were mostly found in fraction 10, and CNX was mostly found in fractions 2-4 ( Figure 5A ). RNF5 does not participate in the HRD1 dislocon complex (Christianson et al., Altogether, these data and the fact that NHK accumulated in fraction 10 upon inhibition of proteasomal activity ( Figure 5D ) led us to conclude that this fraction contains active dislocons engaged by HRD1 clients for retrotranslocation across the ER membrane. Consistent with evolutionary conservation of this function in the mammalian system, silencing HERP expression (siHERP; Figure S6B ) caused a sedimentation shift of SEL1L-, HRD1-, and DER1-containing complexes from fraction 10 (Figures 5A-5C and S6D; for cells treated with a scrambled small interfering RNA [siSCR]) to fractions 7 and 8 ( Figures 5E, S6D , and S6F; siHERP). This corresponds to a reduction in HRD1 dislocon size from more than 2,000 kDa (>26S) to approximately 700 kDa (19S). Analysis of the gradients has been repeated 6, 3, 2, 2, 2, and 2 times, respectively.

By inhibiting the disassembly that occurs when dislocation machineries are unengaged (this study), misfolded proteins may also inhibit the segregation of ERAD factors such as SEL1L, EDEM1, and OS-9 in ER-derived vesicles or in ER subdomains (Bernasconi et al., HRD1 dislocons are unstable when not engaged by clients. It is a matter of further investigations to understand whether the client-dependent regulation mechanisms shown to operate for the HRD1 pathway also exist to regulate other dislocation machineries and other ERAD pathways.

51,51,6e1d09d8718883bdfbe66bc309c398251dccff35,,Article Intraepithelial Type 1 Innate Lymphoid Cells Are a Unique Subset of IL-12-and IL-15-Responsive IFN-g-Producing Cells,"Mucosal innate lymphoid cell (ILC) subsets promote immune responses to pathogens by producing distinct signature cytokines in response to changes in the cytokine microenvironment. We previously identified human ILC3 distinguished by interleukin-22 (IL-22) secretion. Here we characterized a human ILC1 subset that produced interferon-g (IFN-g) in response to IL-12 and IL-15 and had a unique integrin profile, intraepithelial location, hallmarks of TGF-b imprinting, and a memory-activated phenotype. Because tissue-resident memory CD8 + T cells share this profile, intraepithelial ILC1 may be their innate counterparts. In mice, intraepithelial ILC1 were distinguished by CD160 expression and required Nfil3and Tbx21-encoded transcription factors for development, but not IL-15 receptor-a, indicating that intraepithelial ILC1 are distinct from conventional NK cells. Intraepithelial ILC1 were amplified in Crohn's disease patients and contributed to pathology in the anti-CD40-induced colitis model in mice. Thus, intraepithelial ILC1 may initiate IFN-g responses against pathogens but contribute to pathology when dysregulated.","Recent studies have shown that both aggregated and diffuse lymphoid tissues of the oral and gastrointestinal mucosa harbor various innate lymphoid cell (ILC) subsets that contribute to early immune responses against pathogens by secreting different cytokines (Cherrier et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2012; Spits et al., 2013) . Remarkably, these ILC subsets resemble the discrete T helper cell effectors Th1, Th2, Th17, and Th22 cells in terms of the signature cytokines and transcription factors that determine their development. We recently identified a unique type of human ILC marked by the natural killer (NK) cell surface molecule NKp44, the signature cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22), expression of the receptors for IL-1 (IL-1R), IL-7 (IL-7Ra), and IL-23 (IL-23Ra), and the chemokine receptor CCR6 (Cella et al., 2009 (Cella et al., , 2010 . We refer to these cells and their murine counterparts as type 3 ILC (ILC3) (Spits et al., 2013) . Acting on epithelial cells, IL-22 induces the release of antimicrobial peptides that protect the integrity of the mucosal barrier from pathogens (Ouyang et al., 2011; Sonnenberg et al., 2011) . IL-22 release is triggered by IL-23 and enhanced by IL-1, both of which are produced by antigen presenting cells (APC) in response to pathogens or other inflammatory stimuli. ILC3 development requires IL-7 signaling and the transcription factors Id2, RORgt (Cherrier et al., 2012; Spits et al., 2013) , AHR (Kiss et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012; Qiu et al., 2012) , and Notch (Lee et al., 2012; Possot et al., 2011) . Human ILC3 maintain a certain degree of functional plasticity, because they can produce interferon-g (IFN-g) when cultured in vitro with IL-7+IL-2, IL-1b+IL-2, or IL-7+IL-1b+IL-23 (Cella et al., 2010) .
 Additional cells expressing NKp44 or other NK cell markers have been described in the human oral and gastrointestinal mucosa, including tonsilar NKp44 + CD103 + NK cells (Cella et al., 2010) , small intestine CD7 + CD3 À intraepithelial lymphocytes (Eiras et al., 2000) , colon lamina propria NKp46 + NKp44 À cells (Takayama et al., 2010) , and rectal intraepithelial and lamina propria NKp46 + cells (Sips et al., 2012) . Cells with NK cell activity were also reported in the murine intestinal epithelium and lamina propria (Carman et al., 1986; Tagliabue et al., 1982) . Although these reports suggest further phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of mucosal ILC, the functions and responsiveness to pathogenic stimuli of these ILC subsets are poorly understood. It is also unclear whether these cells are related to ILC3 or classical NK cells. In this study, we demonstrated that the human tonsil and intestinal mucosa contain a unique NKp44 + CD103 + cell subset that produced IFN-g in response to IL-12 and IL-15. These cells were different from classical NK cells in that they were selectively located within the epithelium, expressed the chemokine receptor CXCR6, and reflected features of TGF-b imprinting. Moreover, they had an integrin profile and a memory-activated phenotype similar to that previously observed in tissue resident memory CD8 T (Trm) cells, which are virusspecific cells that persist in the mucosae and skin after the resolution of viral infections (Casey et (legend continued on next page)
 Type 1 Innate Lymphoid Cells in the Gut et al., 2012, reviewed in Cauley and Lefranç ois, 2013) . Intraepithelial NKp44 + CD103 + cell numbers were increased in Crohn's disease patients, suggesting that they contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We further identified the murine counterparts of intraepithelial NKp44 + CD103 + cells, which were distinguished by expression of CD160, as well as NKp46 and NK1.1. We found that these cells were strongly reduced in mice lacking the transcription factors Nfil3 (also known as E4bp4) (Male et al., 2012) and Tbx21, but not in Il15ra À/À mice, corroborating that intraepithelial NKp46 + NK1.1 + CD160 + cells represent an ILC1 subset distinct from classical NK cells. Murine intraepithelial ILC1 promptly produced IFN-g in the anti-CD40-induced colitis model and contributed to intestinal inflammation. Thus, intraepithelial ILC1 may facilitate immune responses during exposure to infections but contribute to IBD when dysregulated.
 We sought to delineate the diversity of human ILC in mucosalassociated lymphoid tissues. We isolated CD56 + cells from human tonsils and analyzed them by flow cytometry for the expression of NKp44, CD103, and CD3. Within the CD3 À compartment, we identified two cell subsets, NKp44 + and NKp44 À cells ( Figure 1A ). NKp44 + cells could be further divided into CD103 + and CD103 À cells. The NKp44 À population was mainly CD103 À but included small numbers of CD103 lo cells, which varied considerably among individuals and therefore were not further examined.
 We next determined which of these subsets produced IL-22. CD56 + cells isolated from tonsils were stimulated with IL-23 and analyzed for intracellular content of IL-22 as well as surface expression of NKp44, CD103, and the prototypic ILC3 cell surface markers, including CCR6, IL-1R, and IL-7Ra. NKp44 + CD103 À cells produced IL-22 ( Figure 1A ) and many expressed CCR6, IL-1R, and IL-7Ra ( Figure 1B ) and therefore corresponded to ILC3. In contrast, NKp44 + CD103 + cells and NKp44 À CD103 À cells produced no or little IL-22 ( Figure 1A ) and did not express CCR6, IL-1R, or IL-7Ra ( Figure 1B ).
 Mucosal NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 -CD103 -Cells Are Type 1 ILC To evaluate the function of NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 À CD103 À cells, we initially assessed cytokine production by intracellular staining following stimulation with PMA and ionomycin. Both NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 À CD103 À cells produced more IFN-g and CCL4 than ILC3, but less GM-CSF ( Figure 1C ). We then asked which physiological stimuli induce IFN-g in NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 À CD103 À cells. Typically, ILCs produce signature cytokines when challenged with other cytokines, independent of signaling through immunoreceptors Soudja et al., 2012) . Accordingly, both NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 À CD103 À cells produced IFN-g when stimulated in vitro with IL-12 or IL-15 ( Figure 1D ). Moreover, IL-12 and IL-15 had a strong synergistic effect. IL-23, which stimulates ILC3, was ineffective (data not shown). IFN-g production by NKp44 À CD103 À cells was particularly efficient in a subset expressing CD27 (see Figure S1 available online), similar to what has been shown for blood NK cells (Silva et al., 2008) .
 Interestingly, the magnitude of IFN-g production by NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 À CD103 À cells was similar to that of peripheral blood CD56 hi NK cells ( Figure 1D ), which are known producers of IFN-g in response to cytokines (Cooper et al., 2001) , and superior to that of peripheral blood CD56 lo NK cells ( Figure 1D ), which specialize in the release of lytic granules (Cooper et al., 2001) . However, although CD56 hi NK cells were responsive to IL-18, NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 À CD103 À cells produced equal amounts of IFN-g following stimulation with either IL-12+IL-18 or IL-12 alone, demonstrating that these cells do not respond to IL-18 ( Figure 1D ). Based on their ability to rapidly produce IFN-g in response to IL-12 and IL-15, we conclude that NKp44 + CD103 + cells and NKp44 À CD103 À cells belong to type 1 ILC (ILC1), which are the innate counterparts of Th1 CD4 T cells and include blood NK cells, particularly the CD56 hi subset.
 NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 À CD103 À ILC1 not only produced IFN-g but approximately 50% of these cells also contained intracellular perforin and granzymes ( Figure 1E ; data not shown), consistent with potential cytotoxic activity. In NKp44 À CD103 À ILC1, granzyme production precisely paralleled IFN-g production ( Figure S1 ). To corroborate the lytic activity of NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 À CD103 À ILC1, we monitored degranulation of all ILC subsets by measuring cell surface expression of CD107a in the presence of the tumor cell line K562. Both NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 À CD103 À ILC1 expressed more CD107a than ILC3 ( Figure 1F ). We conclude that NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 À CD103 À ILC1 not only produce IFN-g but can also release lytic mediators when activating receptors are engaged by cognate ligands expressed on target cells.
 NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 Have an Intraepithelial Location CD103 promotes the interaction of lymphocytes with epithelial cells by binding E-cadherin (Cepek et al., 1994) and is a marker of intraepithelial T lymphocytes (Cheroutre et al., 2011; Sheridan and Lefranç ois, 2010) . The majority of NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed additional intraepithelial lymphocyte markers, such as CD160, which has been recently shown to bind to HVEM on epithelial cells promoting epithelial cell defense mechanisms (A) Left shows expression of NKp44 and CD103 on tonsil CD56 + cells, gated on live CD3 À CD19 À cells. Right shows that tonsil CD56 + cells were stimulated with IL-23 and stained for intracellular IL-22. Cells were gated on the NKp44 + and the NKp44 À fractions. (B) Surface markers of tonsilar NKp44 + CD103 + cells (red lines), ILC3 (NKp44 + CD103 À , blue lines), and NKp44 À CD103 À cells (black lines). (C) After stimulation in vitro with PMA and ionomycin, cytokine content of tonsil CD56 + cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Data displayed are the frequencies of cytokine-positive cells within NKp44 + CD103 + cells, ILC3, and NKp44 À CD103 À cells obtained from 5 to 13 different donors. (D) Tonsil and peripheral blood CD56 + cells were cultured with IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, or with combinations of these cytokines. After 9 hr, tonsil NKp44 + CD103 + cells, tonsil NKp44 À CD103 À cells, blood CD56 lo (CD3 À CD16 + CD56 lo ), and blood CD56 hi (CD3 À CD16 À CD56 hi ) cells were analyzed for IFN-g content. (E) Cytotoxic potential of NKp44 + cells was analyzed by intracellular staining for granzymes and perforin. Gray profiles indicate the ILC3 subset; black lines denote NKp44 + CD103 + cells. (F) Frequency of CD107a + cells following coculture of ILC subsets with K562. Shown are combined results obtained from seven individual donors. Data are represented as mean ± SD.
 Type 1 Innate Lymphoid Cells in the Gut (Shui et al., 2012) (Figure 2A ), as well as CD101 (also known as EWI-101) (Allez et al., 2002) (Figure 2A ). Neither ILC3 nor NKp44 À CD103 À ILC1 expressed substantial amounts of CD160 or CD101. Thus, we hypothesized that NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 are intraepithelial. We investigated serial sections of human tonsils for NKp44 and CD103 expression by immunohistochemistry. We found that numerous NKp44 + cells localized in the epithelia overlaying the crypts and the surface of the tonsil, Figure S2 (A-D) CD56 + cells enriched from tonsils were analyzed for surface markers gating on live CD3 À CD19 À cells.
 Red lines indicate NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1, blue lines denote ILC3 (NKp44 + CD103 À ), and black lines indicate NKp44 À CD103 À cells. Representative data from experiments with three or more individual tonsil samples are shown. (E) Tonsil CD56 + cells were sorted into the three subsets described in (A)-(D), and mRNA content for NEDD9 and ITGAE (encoding CD103) was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Displayed are normalized data from qRT-PCR experiments with three (NEDD9) and five (ITGAE) individual donors. Data are represented as mean ± SD. (F) NKp44 + CD103 + cells were sorted from tonsils, cultured in IL-15 with or without the addition of TGF-b for 9 days, and analyzed for CD103 and NKp44 expression. (G) Tonsil CD56 + cells were analyzed for surface expression of activation markers as in (A)-(D). particularly in ''lymphoepithelial'' areas where lymphocytes infiltrate the epithelium (Figure S2) . Fewer NKp44 + cells were found in the interfollicular areas, and none in the follicles ( Figure S2 ; data not shown). CD103 was found on a fraction of NKp44 + cells, and two-color staining with CD103 and CD3 confirmed the presence of CD103 + cells in tonsil epithelia that were CD3 À and thus distinct from T cells ( Figure S2 ). We conclude that the large majority of NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 have an intraepithelial location.
 We asked whether CD103 is part of a unique integrin profile that distinguishes NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 from other ILC subsets within tonsils. We found that NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 selectively express high amounts of beta7 integrin, which associates with CD103 to form aEb7 heterodimers ( Figure 2B ). Conversely, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed low amounts of CD11b (alpha M integrin) and CD11c (alpha X integrin). Additionally, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed high levels of the collagen-binding integrin CD49a (also known as alpha 1 integrin or VLA-1) (Figure 2B) . Notably, expression of aEb7 and CD49a is characteristic of CD8 Trm, which are also preferentially located within the epithelium and poised for prompt effector functions (Cauley and Lefranç ois, 2013) . In contrast to NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1, NKp44 À CD103 À ILC1 and ILC3 expressed the integrins CD11b and CD11c and lacked aEb7 and CD49a.
 We also assessed the chemokine receptor profile of NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1. Unexpectedly, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 did not express CCR9, which has been shown to be a major chemokine receptor that drives lymphocytes into the epithelium ( Figure 2C ). In contrast, they expressed CXCR6, a chemokine receptor that was previously found on liver NK cells with memory-like features (Paust et al., 2010) and that mediates lymphoepithelial adhesion in the gut (Hase et al., 2006) . Thus, intraepithelial ILC1 express a unique repertoire of homing receptors that promote retention in the epithelia.
 It has been shown that CD103 denotes a cellular response to TGF-b (Keskin et al., 2007) . Indeed, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed additional markers of TGF-b exposure including the tetraspanin CD9 (Keskin et al., 2007) and the integrin-signaling molecule NEDD9 (Giampieri et al., 2009) (Figures 2D and 2E ). Corroborating the influence of TGF-b in NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 development, we found that tonsil NKp44 + CD103 + cells cultured in vitro with TGF-b together with either IL-2 or IL-15 maintained CD103 expression, whereas in the presence of IL-2 and IL-15 alone cells survived and proliferated but lost CD103 expression over time ( Figure 2F ). By regulating the expression of integrins and integrin signaling molecules, TGF-b may promote adhesion of ILC1 to epithelial cells (Giampieri et al., 2009) . Interestingly, blood NK cells only engender few NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 cells when cultured with either IL-2 or IL-15 and TGF-b or supernatant from intestinal epithelial cell lines (data not shown), suggesting that, although related to conventional NK cells, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 cells may have a unique developmental pathway.
 Intraepithelial NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed higher amounts of the IL-2 receptor subunit beta (IL-2Rb or CD122), as well as the activation markers CD39, CD69, and SIRP-g, than did NKp44 À CD103 À ILC1 ( Figure 2G ). NK cell receptors, such as NKp46, NKp30, CD244, CD94, NKG2A, NKG2C, and NKG2D, were similar in NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 and NKp44 À CD103 À ILC1 ( Figure S2 ). KIR expression was very low on both cell subsets as it was on ILC3 ( Figure S2 ). CD57, which was previously noted on rectal mucosa intraepithelial NK cells (Sips et al., 2012) , was not observed on any subset ( Figure S2 ). Considering the entire phenotypic analysis of ILC subsets, we conclude that intraepithelial ILC1 express hallmarks of TGF-b imprinting and activation. The expression of activation markers on intraepithelial ILC1 is reminiscent of the activated phenotype seen on CD8 Trm (Cauley and Lefranç ois, 2013) .
 To gain insight into the development of intraepithelial ILC1, we compared all ILC subsets for expression of transcription factors that play a key role in ILC development by intracellular staining and RT-PCR. Both NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 À CD103 À ILC1 expressed T-bet and Eomes ( Figure 3A and 3B), which have been implicated in the development and function of conventional NK cells (Gordon et al., 2012) , but not RORgt or AHR, which drive ILC3 cell differentiation (Spits et al., 2013) . Foxp3 was undetectable in all subsets. Interestingly, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed higher levels of IKZF3 transcript than other ILC. IKZF3 encodes Aiolos, a member of the Ikaros family of transcription factors that regulates B and T cell development (Cortes et al., 1999 ) but heretofore has not been implicated in ILC development or function. Intraepithelial ILC1 Respond to Disparate Danger Signals Because NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 are intraepithelial, they may produce IFN-g in response to signals produced by epithelial cells. To test this hypothesis, we challenged an epithelial cell line with different TLR agonists. We then added CD56 + cells isolated from human tonsils to the cultures and analyzed intracellular IFN-g content in NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 by flow cytometry. NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 produced more IFN-g when incubated with epithelial cells stimulated with the TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 than with epithelial cells stimulated with the TLR3 agonist polyI:C or unstimulated epithelial cells ( Figures 4A and 4B) . Similarly, elevated IFN-g levels were detected in the supernatants from FACS-sorted NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 cocultured with Pam3CSK4-stimulated epithelial cells (Figures 4C and 4D) . (E and F) Tonsil CD56 + cells were cocultured for 9 hr with peripheral blood CD14 + monocytes (E) or monocyte-derived dendritic cells (F) pretreated with poly I:C or Pam3CSK4. IFN-g content of NKp44 + CD103 + cells was determined by intracellular staining.
 TLR2 agonists had no direct effect on ILC1 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that intraepithelial ILC1 are responsive to danger signals produced by epithelial cells.
 Because IL-12 induces IFN-g production by intraepithelial ILC1 (see Figure 1 ) and is secreted by inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) (Trinchieri, 2003) , we asked whether NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 produce IFN-g in response to signals generated by monocytes and monocyte-derived DC. We challenged monocytes and monocyte-derived DC with different TLR agonists. We then added CD56 + cells isolated from human tonsils to the cultures and analyzed the IFN-g content in ILC1 by flow cytometry. ILC1 produced more IFN-g when incubated with polyI:C-stimulated monocytes and DC than with Pam3CSK4stimulated monocytes and DC (Figures 4E and 4F ). Altogether these results indicate that intraepithelial ILC1 respond to danger signals originating from both epithelial cells and myeloid cells. It is likely that epithelial cells transmit the dominant danger signals when pathogenic attack is limited to the mucosal surface, whereas monocytes and DC stimulation of intraepithelial ILC1 might prevail when the epithelial barrier is breached, leading to DC activation in the underlying tissue.
 We sought to extend our analysis of NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 to the intestinal mucosa. We separated intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) from noninflamed areas of human small intestine specimens that had been surgically removed to treat IBD. NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 were found primarily in the IEL and only in low numbers within LPL, corroborating our hypothesis that NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 are mainly intraepithelial lymphocytes ( Figure 5A ). In contrast, ILC3 were mainly found in the lamina propria. NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 from the small intestine expressed most prototypic markers noted on their tonsilar counterparts, including NKp44, NKp46, CD39 ( Figure 5A) , CD101, CD49a, and CD160 (data not shown). The only exception was CD94, which was poorly expressed on small intestine NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 ( Figure 5A ). NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 were also present in the epithelium of the colon ( Figure 5B ) but were not detected in nonmucosal tissues, such as axillary lymph nodes ( Figure S3 ) or peripheral blood (data not shown). These results confirmed that NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 are selectively located within the mucosal epithelium.
 Immunohistochemical analysis of NKp44, CD103, and CD3 in the appendix and intestinal villi showed that although the majority of NKp44 + cells are found in the lamina propria, some cells are located within the epithelium ( Figure 5C ; data not shown). Among numerous CD103 + cells detectable within the epithelium, some were CD3 À , indicating that the intestinal epithelium harbors a small but detectable subset of NKp44 + . T-bet + CD3 À are indicated (arrows). (E) Samples from ileal resections of CD patients (CD) and non-IBD controls (NC) were analyzed for the ratio of NKp44 + CD103 + cells versus CD3 + T cells within CD45 + IEL. CD103 + ILC1 among numerous intraepithelial T cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of T-bet and CD3 distribution in appendix and intestinal villi confirmed the presence in the intestinal epithelium of a small but detectable number of CD3 À T-bet + ILC amid numerous CD3 + T-bet + T cells ( Figure 5D ).
 During IBD, dysregulated T cell production of IFN-g and IL-17 causes excessive inflammation, tissue damage, and loss of barrier function (Geremia et al., 2011; Strober and Fuss, 2011) . Because of their ability to secrete IFN-g and CCL4, intraepithelial NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 might contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD if inappropriately activated. We compared the frequencies of these cells in samples of small intestine surgically excised from Crohn's disease (CD) patients and non-IBD controls. Remarkably, we detected higher frequencies of NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 within the intraepithelial lymphocytes in CD patients compared to non-IBD controls ( Figure 5E ). Although low cell yields from these small tissue samples prevented functional studies, their increase during inflammation suggested that NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 are involved in the pathogenesis of CD.
 Receptor a We sought to identify the murine counterpart of intraepithelial NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1. To facilitate their recognition, we isolated IEL from Rag1 À/À mice. NKp44 is only encoded in humans, and CD103 was unexpectedly inadequate because CD103 + cells were hardly detectable within CD3 À IEL (data not shown). In contrast, CD160 was an optimal marker of intraepithelial ILC1 because we detected a distinct population of CD160 + NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells within the IEL of Rag1 À/À mice ( Figure 6A ). Spleen NK cells did not express CD160 in steady state, corroborating the specificity of this marker for intraepithelial ILC1 ( Figure S4 ). Stimulation of IEL of Rag1 À/À and C57BL/6 mice with IL-12 and IL-15 induced rapid IFN-g production by CD3 À CD160 + NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells, mirroring the human ILC1 response ( Figures 6B and 6C ). In contrast, IL-23 did not induce IFN-g production ( Figure 6C ). The identification of the phenotype of murine intraepithelial ILC1 gave us the opportunity to investigate the transcription factors required for their development. Intraepithelial ILC1 were conserved in Rorc À/À and Ahr À/À mice, which lack ILC3 ( Figure 6D ). In contrast, these cells were dramatically reduced in the IEL of mice with knock-out mutations of Nfil3 or Tbx21, which encode two transcription factors previously shown to be master regulators of NK cell development (Gordon et al., 2012; Male et al., 2012) (Figure 6D ). Normal numbers of ILC1 were present in the IEL of germ-free mice and slightly reduced numbers of ILC1 were found in neonatal mice ( Figure 6E ). Altogether, these results indicated that intraepithelial ILC1 can develop independently of the intestinal microbiota and are more related to the NK cell lineage than to ILC3.
 To gain more insights into the developmental relationship between intraepithelial ILC1 and conventional NK cells, we analyzed these cells in Il15ra À/À mice. As previously reported (Lodolce et al., 1998) , these mice showed an almost complete absence of splenic NK cells ( Figure 6F ). However, intraepithelial ILC1 were minimally affected by lack of IL-15 receptor a (IL-15Ra) ( Figure 6F ) and maintained expression of CD160 ( Figure 6G ). These data corroborate that intraepithelial ILC1 are a unique ILC1 subset distinct from conventional NK cells.
 Because the numbers of intraepithelial ILC1 are increased in CD and may have proinflammatory functions, we evaluated the presence and function of intraepithelial ILC1 in a mouse model of IBD caused by injection of anti-CD40 in Rag1 À/À mice (Buonocore et al., 2010; Uhlig et al., 2006) . Following injection of anti-CD40, Rag1 À/À mice rapidly lost weight and developed colitis as previously described (Uhlig et al., 2006) . Analysis of IEL isolated from the small intestine 36 hr after injection of anti-CD40 revealed a robust production of IFN-g by CD160 + NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells ( Figure 7A ), corroborating their early proinflammatory function in this model. IFN-g was also produced by a small percentage of NKp46 + NK1.1 À cells, which correspond to ILC3 (Spits et al., 2013) . This observation was consistent with our previous demonstration that human ILC3 are functionally plastic. ILC3 can produce IFN-g when cultured in vitro with IL-7+IL-2, IL-1b+IL-2, or IL-7+IL-1b+IL-23, acquire responsiveness to IL-12, upregulate the expression of T-bet, and downregulate that of RORgt (Cella et al., 2010;  Figure S5 ). In vivo, the functional conversion of ILC3 into IFN-g-producing cells may occur when there is increased production of IL-15, IL-23, or IL-2 due to excessive activation of APC or T cells in IBD.
 To determine whether CD160 + NKp46 + NK1.1 + ILC1 directly contribute to the pathogenesis of anti-CD40-induced colitis in Rag1 À/À mice, we depleted intraepithelial ILC1 and conventional NK cells with anti-NK1.1. Anti-NK1.1 treatment did not affect weight loss over a 7 day time period (Figure 7B ), suggesting that depletion of ILC1 or NK cells does not affect the systemic wasting disease. However, histochemical analysis of tissue sections of proximal colon revealed significantly less cellular inflammatory infiltrates and epithelial damage in NK1.1 depleted than control mice ( Figure 7C ). These results suggest that intraepithelial ILC1 may play a pathogenic role in IBD through IFN-g secretion.
 Our study extends the diversity of human ILC within the oral and gastrointestinal mucosa, characterizing a subset of human IFN-g-producing ILC, designated intraepithelial ILC1. Although related to NK cells, intraepithelial ILC1 were unique in that they were located in the mucosal epithelium, shared multiple phenotypic and functional features with CD8 T rm , and had several hallmarks of TGF-b imprinting. We also identified the murine intraepithelial ILC1 and found that they were largely independent of IL-15Ra, corroborating that these ILCs are distinct from conventional NK cells, which require IL-15Ra for development. Although sharing the NKp44 marker with human ILC3, ILC1 also clearly differed from ILC3 in terms of phenotype, function, and transcription factors involved in development. In addition to intraepithelial ILC1, we also identified a subset of human IFN-g-producing NKp44 À CD103 À ILC1 that may be related to intraepithelial ILC1 and perhaps can acquire similar characteristics when transiting from the lamina propria to the epithelium.
 ILC produce signature cytokines in response to cytokine stimulation . Optimal production requires stimulation by a STAT activator and an NF-kB inducer, most commonly an IL-1 family member. For example, IFN-g-producing NK cells respond to the IL-1 family member IL-18 and the WT Il15ra -/-WT Il15ra -/- Figure 6 . Phenotype, Function, and Developmental Requirements of Murine Intraepithelial ILC1, See Also Figure S4 (A) Small intestine IEL of Rag-1 À/À mice were analyzed for the expression of NKp46, NK1.1, and CD160. The majority of NKp46 + NK1.1 + IEL (histogram, black line) express CD160, whereas NKp46 + NK1.1 À ILC3 (histogram, gray profile) do not. Control staining of NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells is indicated by a dotted line. Cells in the dot plots were gated on live lymphocytes. (B) IEL from Rag-1 À/À mice were stimulated in vitro with IL-12 and IL-15 and analyzed for intracellular IFN-g. Cells were gated on CD45 + NK1.1 + cells.
 (C) IEL from C57BL/6 mice were stimulated in vitro with a combination of IL-12 and IL-15, or with IL-23 and IL-1b, and analyzed for intracellular IFN-g. Cells were gated on CD45 + CD3 À NKp46 + cells.

(G) ILC1 from small intestinal epithelium of wild-type (black line) and IL15ra À/À mice (dotted line) express similar levels of CD160.

 STAT4 activator IL-12. However, mucosal ILC1 differed from conventional NK cells because they required a STAT4 (IL-12) and a STAT5 (IL-15) activator, whereas the NF-kB activator IL-18 was not effective alone or in combination with IL-12 or IL-15. Given that IL-15 has been shown to be an important inflammatory mediator in gastrointestinal diseases such as celiac disease (Jabri and Sollid, 2009) , the responsiveness of intraepithelial ILC1 to IL-15 may be an important pathogenic factor in intestinal inflammation. Interestingly, intraepithelial ILC1 shared multiple phenotypic and functional features with CD8 Trm, which persist in the gastrointestinal tract, lung mucosae, and skin long after a primary infection has cleared and are very effective at preventing reinfection (Cauley and Lefranç ois, 2013) . Given this, we envision that intraepithelial ILC1 are the innate counterparts of nonmigratory CD8 T rm . Epstein-Barr virus (Strowig et al., 2008) and human cytomegalovirus infection of tonsils as well as viral infections of the small intestine (Carman et al., 1986) may result in an accumulation or activation of intraepithelial ILC1, which are retained in the epithelium to prevent reinfection. It will be important to explore the relationship between intraepithelial ILC1 and the recently reported memory NK cells (Cooper et al., 2009; Romee et al., 2012; Sun and Lanier, 2011) . Like intraepithelial CD8 T cells, ILC1 also expressed CD160 and therefore may be the major innate trigger of HVEM-mediated epithelial antimicrobial response (Shui et al., 2012) .
 Intraepithelial ILC1 were unique in that they were located in the mucosal epithelium and showed several hallmarks of TGF-b imprinting, particularly expression of CD103, CD9, and NEDD9, most likely reflecting close interaction with the epithelium that produces TGF-b. TGF-b imprinting was previously observed in decidual NK cells, which are in close contact with the fetal trophoblast and presumably contribute to maternalfetal tolerance (Koopman et al., 2003) . However, in contrast to decidual NK cells, intraepithelial ILC1 had an activated-memory phenotype and secreted IFN-g as well as lytic mediators, consistent with a proinflammatory function. By inducing a unique profile of adhesion and integrin signaling molecules, TGF-b may be important for maintaining the adhesiveness of ILC1 to epithelial cells rather than inducing a tolerogenic function. Figure S5 (A) Rag-1 À/À mice were left untreated or injected with anti-CD40 to induce colitis. Thirty-six hr after injection, small intestinal IEL were isolated, and the frequency of IFN-g-positive cells within ILC1 (top panel) and ILC3 (bottom panel), gated as shown in Figure 6A , was determined by intracellular staining. (B and C) ILC1 contribute to the intestinal pathology during anti-CD40-induced colitis. Rag-1 À/À mice were treated with anti-NK1.1 to deplete intraepithelial ILC1, and colitis was induced with anti-CD40. Intestinal tissue pathology in the proximal colon was analyzed on day 7 after anti-CD40 treatment. ''Control'' indicates mice injected with anti-CD40 without anti-NK1.1 treatment. (B) shows the weight of mice recorded as the percentage of initial weight. Data are represented as mean ± SD (C) Left shows H&E staining of proximal colon sections at day 7 after anti-CD40 injection, showing more severe cellular infiltration in control mice compared to anti-NK1.1-treated mice. Right shows colitis score at day 7 determined from H&E staining of proximal colon samples. Data are represented as mean ± SD.
 In our study we identified the murine counterpart of intraepithelial ILC1 as CD3 À IEL that coexpress CD160, NKp46, and NK1.1. This observation enabled us to examine the developmental pathway of intraepithelial ILC1 in mice with targeted mutations of master transcription factors, demonstrating the requirement of Nfil3 and Tbx21, factors involved in the development of conventional NK cells. In contrast, Rorc and Ahr were dispensable. Although these results, together with the abundance of T-bet protein and EOMES transcript in human intraepithelial ILC1, suggested a relationship of intraepithelial ILC1 with conventional NK cells, we found that intraepithelial ILC1 were largely independent of IL-15Ra, indicating that intraepithelial ILC1 are developmentally distinct from conventional NK cells. It is possible that intraepithelial ILC1 are capable of exploiting other cytokines for their development, such as IL-7 or IL-2, or they do not require transpresentation of IL-15. Moreover, ILC1 expressed the transcription factor Aiolos, which may contribute to some of the unique developmental and phenotypic features of these cells.
 We found that frequencies of intraepithelial ILC1 were increased in Crohn's disease patients. We also observed that intraepithelial ILC1 produced high amounts of IFN-g in Rag1 À/À mice treated with anti-CD40, a model of colitis characterized by wasting syndrome and severe intestinal inflammation. Although it was previously shown that IL-12 and IL-23 play a major role in the wasting syndrome and colon inflammation, respectively (Buonocore et al., 2010; Uhlig et al., 2006) , we found that depletion of intraepithelial ILC1 ameliorated proximal colon inflammation. Together, these results indicate that intraepithelial ILC1 are poised for robust IFN-g production, which may be important for orchestrating innate responses to infectious agents and preventing reinfection after elimination of the inciting pathogen. However, they may contribute to IBD when dysregulated.
 The commercial sources of the antibodies used for flow cytometric analysis are indicated in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Stained cells were analyzed on a FACS Calibur or FACS Canto using CellQuest and Diva programs, respectively. Dead cells were excluded with propidium iodide (Sigma Aldrich) or 7-AAD (BD Biosciences). Anti-CD45 was included in flow cytometric analysis of small intestinal lymphocytes to gate on live CD45 + cells. Flow cytometric analyses were performed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star).
 All mice were maintained in a pathogen-free facility and animal protocols were approved by the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) animal studies committee. Ahr À/À mice were described before (Lee et al., 2012) . Rorc À/À and Rag-1 À/À mice were obtained from Jackson laboratories. Nfil3 À/À , Tbx21 À/À , Il15ra À/À , and germ-free adult female mice were kindly provided by Drs Paul Rothman (University of Iowa), Takeshi Egawa (WUSM), Anthony R. French (WUSM), and Jeffrey I. Gordon (WUSM), respectively. All mice were on a C57BL/6 background. Mice were used between 6 and 8 weeks of age, with the exception of those used to study neonate IEL from the small intestine, which were 10 days old.
 Tonsils, intestinal samples, and peripheral blood products were obtained under the approval of the WUSM institutional review board. Tissue sources are described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Tonsilar lymphocyte suspensions and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared as previously described (Cella et al., 2009; Cella et al., 2010) . IEL and LPL were prepared as previously described (Lefrancois and Lycke, 2001) . CD56 + cells were enriched from tonsil lymphocytes by magnetic cell sorting using CD56 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec). ILC subsets were sorted from CD56 + cells as previously reported (Cella et al., 2010) and described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
 For cytokine analyses, CD56-enriched tonsil cells were stimulated with 10 À7 M PMA and 1 mg/ml ionomycin (both from Sigma Aldrich) for 6 hr at 37 C. 2 mM monensin (Sigma Aldrich) was added during the final 4 hr of culture. Alternatively, human tonsil CD56 + cells or mouse IEL were cultured for 9 hr in the presence of 50 ng/ml human IL-15 and 10 ng/ml human or mouse IL-12, or with 100 ng/ml human or mouse IL-23 (all from Peprotech). Cells were stained for surface markers, followed by fixation, intracellular cytokine staining and analysis by flow cytometry. IFN-g content in supernatants of CD56 + cells cultured with epithelial cells was measured by Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) (BD Biosciences). For degranulation assays, CD56 + cells were cocultured with K562 tumor cells in the presence of anti-CD107a for 5 hr. Cocultures are described in detail in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
 Tissue Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining of frozen or paraffinembedded tissues are described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
 qRT-PCR RNA and cDNA were prepared from sorted ILC as previously described (Cella et al., 2009) . Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBRGreen (BIORAD). Results were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH and displayed as (mRNA [gene of interest] per mRNA [GAPDH]) 3 10 6 , using the following formula: 2 -[Ct (gene of interest) -Ct (GAPDH)] 3 10 6 . Primers are listed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
 Rag-1 À/À mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 50 ml of anti-CD40 ascites (kind gift of Dr. Antonius Rolink, University of Basel). To deplete ILC1, we injected mice i.p. with 200 ml anti-NK1.1 ascites (PK136) at days À2 and 0 of anti-CD40 treatment. Mice were weighed daily and sacrificed at day 7 after anti-CD40 injection to analyze intestinal pathology as previously described (Uhlig et al., 2006) . To evaluate IFN-g production by IEL, mice were sacrificed 36 hr after anti-CD40 injection. Small intestinal IEL were cultured for 4 hr in the presence of monensin and then analyzed for intracellular IFN-g content.

Moreover, chronic inflammatory diseases of the CNS such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are associated with elevated CCL19 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (Pashenkov et al., CCR7 expression on antiviral T cells was mandatory to prevent lethal neuroinflammatory disease, while provision of extra-lymphatic CCL21 ensured sufficient CD8 + T cell recruitment to and re-activation in the CNS to protect the host from severe disease. Virus Infection Viral infection of the CNS triggers activation of several inflammatory cascades including the generation of chemokines (Hosking and Lane, 2010) . By day 4, viral titers had reached peak values in olfactory bulbs and the virus had spread to distal CNS areas, including the spinal cord. After 6 days, the virus had been eliminated from draining cLNs, while clearance from CNS tissues was not achieved until day 10 ( Figure 1A ). 1990) and cell-to-cell spread (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001 ) as means of dissemination. Values indicate mean ± SEM from two independent experiments (n = 4 mice per time point). Interestingly, mRNA expression of inflammatory chemokines and several genes involved in lymphoid organogenesis such as Ltb, Ltbr, and Il7 were substantially upregulated in the infected olfactory bulb ( Figure 1C ). Elevated chemokine expression was only transient and followed the resolution of the viral infection with substantially lower expression on day 20 post infection ( Figures  1D and 1E) . We crossed Ccl19-cre mice with Rosa26-eyfp mice (referred to as Ccl19 eyfp ) to label cells exhibiting Ccl19 promoter activity with the yellow fluorescent protein. Stromal cell activation with expression of CCL21 was most pronounced in the vicinity of virus-infected cells ( Figure S2D ). Moreover, we found that only very few of the EYFP + stromal cells expressed the proliferation marker Ki67 (data not shown), indicating that the increase in EYFP + stromal cells was a result of their activation with enhanced expression of homeostatic chemokines. Moreover, fibroblastic stromal cells from infected CNS tissue expressed substantially less CD44 molecules, while expression of markers such as CD140a and CD140b was not affected ( Figures 3D and 3E ). These data indicate that two distinct stromal cell populations serve as the main source of CCR7 ligands at hotspots of neurotropic virus replication in the infected CNS. To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether mice lacking either CCR7 or CCR7 ligand expression in SLOs display differences in their defense against neurotropic virus infection. 1999) shows expression of the CCL21b isoform in extra-lymphatic tissues (Nakano and Gunn, 2001) . 2005) , did not affect survival following intranasal MHV A59 infection ( Figure S4F ). To assess the activation and migration pattern of MHV-specific CD8 + T cells in vivo, we utilized a transgenic mouse expressing a H2-K b -restricted TCR that recognizes the immunodominant epitope s598-605 of the MHV spike protein (TCR-S or Spiky). followed by strong proliferation ( Figure 5A ). These data support the notion that access of polyfunctional effector CD8 + T cells to the CNS is important for successful elimination of the virus from this highly vulnerable tissue. Ccr7-deficient mice receiving transfer of Ccr7-proficient Spiky CD8 + T cells showed a mild disease course and survived the infection ( Figures 5G and 5H , white circles) indicating that protection against this neurotropic viral infection depends on the ability of antiviral CD8 + T cells to respond to CCR7 ligands. the numbers of Ccr7proficient Spiky CD8 + T cells infiltrating the CNS were still significantly higher compared to Ccr7-deficient cells ( Figure 6D) . To more closely mirror the kinetics of polyclonal CD8 + T cell activation, only very low numbers of Spiky cells (i.e., 10 4 ) that expressed CCR7 and the congenic marker Ly5.1 or were Ccr7-deficient and labeled with the Thy1.1 marker were cotransferred into plt/plt mice. Next, we specifically ablated CCL19-expressing stromal cells using low doses of diphtheria toxin (DT) applied to Ccl19 eyfp mice that express the DT receptor in Cre recombinase-positive cells (Ccl19 eypf/idtr ) (Buch et al., CD8 + and CD4 + T cell compartments in cLNs were not changed by the DT treatment ( Figures 7G and 7H) . Values indicate mean percentage of the initial weight ± SEM from two independent experiments (n = 7-10 mice per group). ( B) Viral titers in CNS tissues as determined at day 10 after infection.

Graphs indicate mean percentage ± SEM of the respective virus-specific T cell populations from two independent experiments (n = 8 mice per group). CFSE dilution of transferred Thy1.1 + CD8 + T cells from the cLNs (A) and brain tissue (B) was determined by flow cytometry at the indicated time points post infection. Expression of effector cytokines TNF-a and IFN-g and the degranulation marker Lamp-1 by CNS infiltrating Thy1.1 + CD8 + T cells (day 8 p.i.) following in vitro peptide restimulation is shown in representative dot plots (E) and summarized in a bar graph (F) with mean percentage ± SEM pooled from two independent experiments (n = 5 mice). Values in (H) indicate mean percentage of the initial weight ± SEM pooled from three independent experiments (n = 9 mice per group). Values in the plots represent percentage of activated cells (i.e., CD44 high or CD62L low , respectively). Data represent mean value ± SEM from two independent experiments (n = 5-6 mice per group). J) Quantification of CD8 + T cell density in meningeal/submeningeal (M/SM) and parenchymal (PAR) areas as determined by histological analysis in the olfactory bulbs of Ccr7 +/+ and Ccr7 À/À mice. Notably, microglial cells are a prominent source of TNF during viral encephalitis (Ghoshal et al., Thus, infection of microglia cells, a major target cell population of MHV in the CNS, could trigger secretion of TNF that leads to the initial low-level induction of CCL19/CCL21 expression in stromal cells. In addition to their enhanced chemokine production, the phenotype of ECs and FRC-like cells in the affected regions adapted properties that are typical for SLO stromal cells with high level expression of adhesion molecules and upregulation of MHC class I (Malhotra et al., 2009) or during chronic Toxoplasma gondii infection (Wilson et al., Further dissection of cellular and molecular mechanisms that control stromal cell activation in the CNS is warranted to delineate potential avenues for attenuation of inflammatory processes in this vulnerable organ. All mice were maintained in individually ventilated cages and were used in the age of 6 to 9 weeks. Experiments were performed in accordance with federal and cantonal guidelines (Tierschutzgesetz) under the permission numbers SG09/87 and SG13/04 following review and approval by the Veterinary Office of the Canton of St. Gallen. At indicated time points mice were sacrificed, organs were collected, weighed and stored at À80 C until further analysis. For in vivo proliferation, splenocytes were labeled using CFSE (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and 10 7 cells (corresponding to 1 3 10 6 CD8 + TCR transgenic T cells) were transferred intravenously (i.v.)

52,52,32438c147bb00436c6bcf8a508e105c4b35e6ac3,,Crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory signaling pathways: balancing host defence and homeostasis HHS Public Access The role of autophagy in immunity,"Autophagy has broad functions in immunity ranging from cell autonomous defense to coordination of complex multicellular responses. The successful resolution of infection and avoidance of autoimmunity necessitates efficient and timely communication between autophagy and pathways that sense the immune environment. In this article, progress in elucidating mechanisms of crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory signaling cascades will be reviewed. The recent literature indicates that a variety of immune mediators induce or repress autophagy. It is also becoming increasing clear that immune signaling cascades are subject to regulation by autophagy, and that a return to homeostasis following a robust immune response is critically dependent on this pathway. Importantly, examples of non-canonical forms of autophagy in mediating immunity are pervasive. Improved mechanistic understanding of the autophagy machinery offers hope for treating infectious and inflammatory diseases.
 Macroautophagy, more commonly referred to simply as autophagy, is a fundamental cellular process in eukaryotes that is essential for responding and adapting to changes in the environment. In its most common form, autophagy involves sequestration of cytosolic material within a double membrane-bound vesicle termed the autophagosome, and the subsequent fusion of the autophagosome with endolysosomal vesicles leads to degradation and recycling of sequestered substrates. A critical function of autophagy is to breakdown macromolecules such as proteins to provide amino acids and other factors necessary to generate energy and synthesize new proteins. The ability to capture large material distinguishes this pathway from proteasomal degradation, making autophagy critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis in a variety of settings. Many of the substrates found within autophagosomes are those that threaten cell viability, such as damaged organelles, protein aggregates, and intracellular pathogens.
 Although autophagosomes are detected under steady-state conditions, their generation is increased substantially in response to stressors, of which nutrient deprivation is the best","characterized. Depletion of amino acids or growth factors induces autophagy by inhibiting mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a master regulator of metabolism that inhibits the ULK1 complex through phosphorylation under nutrient replete conditions (Box 1). Once freed from inhibition, the ULK1 complex phosphorylates beclin-1 to activate the class III PI3K (PI3KC3) complex 1 , which creates PI3P-rich subdomains at regions associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment or ER-mitochondria contact sites 2, 3 . PI3P binding proteins then recruit the ATG16L1 complex to this autophagosome precursor site (isolation membrane) 4 . The ATG16L1 complex anchors the ubiquitin-like molecule LC3 to the lipid bilayer by conjugating LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Box 1). Next, LC3-PE mediates membrane tethering and fusion to extend the isolation membrane through recruiting lipids, which are likely derived from multiple membrane sources including endosomal vesicles harboring the transmembrane protein ATG9L1. The growing isolation membrane eventually fuses with itself to form the enclosed double-membrane structure, and class C VPS and SNARE-like proteins mediate fusion with endo-lysosomal vesicles leading to the degradation and recycling of the contents.
 The generation of the autophagosome is mediated by the sequential activities of three key protein complexes: the ULK1 complex (ULK1, FIP200, ATG13, and ATG101), the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3KC3) complex (Beclin-1, VPS34, VPS15, and ATG14L), and the ATG16L1 complex (ATG16L1, ATG5, and ATG12). Inhibition of mTORC1, such as through nutrient deprivation, allows the ULK1 complex to activate the PI3KC3 complex (see the figure) . The ATG16L1 complex is recruited by the PI3Pbinding protein WIPI2 to the autophagosome precursor structure (isolation membrane) when the PI3KC3 complex creates PI3P-rich regions on the surface of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment or other membranes. The ATG16L1 complex is generated through an ubiquitin-like (UBL) conjugation reaction in which the UBL molecule ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 by the sequential action of ATG7 and ATG10. ATG16L1 noncovalently binds the ATG5-ATG12 conjugate to form a multimeric complex. In parallel, another UBL molecule, LC3, is processed by the ATG4 protease and subjected to a second UBL conjugation reaction involving ATG7 and ATG3. The ATG16L1 complex conjugates LC3 and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to complete the reaction. LC3-PE mediates membrane tethering and fusion to extend the isolation membrane through recruiting membranes from multiple sources, eventually leading to self-fusion and the formation of the autophagosome. Subsequent fusion with the lysosome, mediated by class C VPS and SNARE-like proteins, leads to the degradation of the contents.
 In this article, the function and regulation of autophagy in the context of inflammatory signals will be reviewed. It is now appreciated that autophagy function is critical to both cell autonomous defense and multicellular immunity alike, and autophagy dysfunction appears to be a recurring theme in inflammatory disease. First, the general function of autophagy in immunity will be summarized. The focus of the second section will be on specific modes of intersection between autophagy and immune pathways, especially signaling downstream of innate immune sensors. The third section will provide examples of how these mechanisms contribute to multicellular immune responses, with an emphasis on adaptive immunity and inflammatory disease. Finally, the barriers for targeting the autophagy pathway to treat disease will be discussed.
 Autophagy can eliminate an infectious threat by promoting xenophagy, whereby intracellular pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoans are trapped within an autophagosome and targeted to the lysosome for destruction. Xenophagy depends on adaptor molecules that crosslink pathogens with the autophagy machinery. For instance, sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1; also known as p62), nuclear domain 10 protein NDP52, optineurin (OPTN), and TAX1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) bind LC3 along with host molecules associated with damaged Salmonella-containing vacuoles, including ubiquitin and galectin-8 5 . These binding events allow the isolation membrane to grow around Salmonella resulting in its sequestration within the autophagosome. One of the most compelling evidence that autophagy is an important cell-intrinsic defense mechanism is that many invasive pathogens encode virulence factors that counteract the pathway, as exemplified by the LC3-deconjugating enzyme RavZ secreted by Legionella pneumophila 6 . Also, autophagy enhances cell-to-cell spread of enteroviruses by providing a membrane coat during egress 7 . Some pathogens are neutralized by non-canonical functions of the autophagy machinery, hereon referred to as 'non-canonical autophagy' (Box 2). For instance, LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) mediates phagosome maturation, and requires many of the same proteins as conventional autophagy but occurs independently of autophagosome formation 8 . Another form of non-canonical autophagy induced by IFNγ restricts norovirus and Toxoplasma gondii replication in macrophages in a lysosome-independent manner [9] [10] [11] . In the case of T. gondii infection, the ATG16L1 complex and LC3 disrupt the parasitophorous vacuole by recruiting p47 immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) and p65 guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) 9, [12] [13] [14] [15] . Although it is not always clear whether the classical or an unconventional form of autophagy is involved in host defense, autophagy proteins remain strong candidates as drug targets in infectious disease. Inducing autophagy with a cell permeable beclin-1 peptide protects against multiple pathogens in vitro and in vivo, including chikungunya and West Nile viruses 16 .
 Several processes have been described in which subsets of the canonical autophagy pathway (see box figure, part a) contribute to immune responses, frequently independent of autophagosome formation. LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) mediates the maturation of phagosomes containing TLR ligands independently of the ULK1 complex, but requires the association of rubicon with the PI3KC3 complex 8 (see box figure, part b). Brucella abortus subverts the ULK1 and PI3KC3 complexes, but not the ATG16L1 complex or LC3, to generate pathogen-containing vacuoles which can either be single or double membrane structures 160 (see box figure, part c). The recruitment of IFN-γ effector molecules (IRGs and GBPs) to the parasitophorous vacuole during Toxoplasma gondii infection is dependent on the the ATG16L1 complex but not autophagosome formation or lysosomes 11 (see box figure, part d). A similar process is involved in inhibition of norovirus replication by IFN-γ 10 . ATG5 prevents neutrophil-mediated lung damage during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection independently of the other ATG16L1 complex members 161 (see box figure, part e). It is unclear whether this function of ATG5 represents a type of non-canonical autophagy or a new function of ATG5. There are several other examples not depicted. Coronavirus replication occurs on ER-derived membranes decorated by the unconjugated form of LC3, and does not require the rest of the autophagy machinery 162 . ATG9L1 represses DNA stimulation of STING independently of the LC3 conjugation machinery. LC3 can be recruited to doublemembrane structures containing internalized Salmonella in the absence of ATG9L1 and subunits of the ULK1 and PI3KC3 complexes 163 . The inhibitory activity of ATG16L1 on NOD1 and NOD2 signaling can occur independently of the autophagy function of this protein 164 . CD4 T cell recognition of DCs harboring T. gondii was shown to depend on ATG5 and not ATG7 165 . Thus, the immune function of conserved autophagy proteins often reflects a non-canonical form of autophagy.
 Autophagy also reduces damage inflicted by pathogens. During Sindbis virus infection, autophagy protects against neuronal cell death without affecting the degree of viral replication 17 . Similarly, in the absence of ATG16L1, the beneficial intestinal virus murine norovirus (MNV) 18 triggers intestinal pathologies in mice through the cytokines TNFα and IFNγ 19 . Viral replication is unaltered in these mice 19 , consistent with a role for autophagy in suppressing the negative impact of inflammatory cytokines produced in responses to an enteric virus. Furthermore, TFEB (HLH-30), a master transcriptional regulator of autophagy and lysosomal genes, protects Caenorhabditis elegans from Staphylococcus aureus infection by promoting a cytoprotective transcriptional response 20 . Autophagy is also essential for the survival of mice with S. aureus-mediated bacteremia and pneumonia. Instead of reducing bacterial burden in these animals, autophagy promotes the viability of endothelial cells in the presence of a pore-forming toxin produced by widely circulating methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains 21 . The vulnerability of autophagy-deficient cells reflects an increase in the toxin receptor ADAM10 at the protein level 21 , indicating that the protein turnover function of autophagy can indirectly contribute to infectious disease susceptibility. Therapeutically increasing autophagy also improves survival in a mouse model of sepsis through reducing inflammation in the lung 22 . Thus, in addition to resistance mechanisms aimed at reducing the number of infectious agents, autophagy facilitates tolerance mechanisms that reduce the adverse effect of an infection 23 .
 A related function of autophagy is to inhibit the production of soluble inflammatory mediators, which can come at the cost of diminishing host defense. Deficiency in autophagy proteins protects against intestinal infection by Citrobacter rodentium, improves survival during lung infection by influenza virus, and prevents reactivation of murine herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) from latency [24] [25] [26] . The enhanced host defense in these models are associated with large scale increases in cytokine levels and/or inflammatory gene expression. Although autophagy inhibition confers a short-term benefit during infection by these specific pathogens, the long-term consequence of this heightened immunity may be chronic inflammatory disease. Additionally, as the above examples with S. aureus, Sindbis virus, and a large number of other studies illustrate, autophagy usually benefits the host during a lifethreatening infection. The ultimate function of autophagy in immunity may be to mediate a balanced immune response whereby the greatest number of different types of infectious threats are neutralized with as little damage to the host as possible, thereby staving off long term disease.
 Amino acid starvation during bacterial infection can induce autophagy 27 , raising the possibility that sensing changes in nutrient availability is an ancient mechanism to turn on autophagy in response to infectious threats. As the immune system evolved, autophagy and related pathways have been integrated into the complex signaling networks that coordinate multicellular defense strategies. An array of pathogen and damage associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) induce or inhibit autophagy in specific contexts. Also, autophagy can feedback on the process of PAMP and DAMP recognition to serve a regulatory role of preventing an over exuberant response. This creates a set of feedback loops between autophagy and immune signaling pathways that mediate host defense while limiting damage.
 NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are cytosolic sensors of PAMPs and DAMPs. Many NLRs are inflammasome subunits that mediate IL-1β and IL-18 production and pyroptosis. The NLRP3 inflammasome, for instance, is activated by diverse stimuli that disrupt mitochondrial integrity, including ATP, bacterial products, and uric acid crystals. Mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy tasked with removing damaged mitochondria, inhibits IL-1β and IL-18 production in response to these stimuli by preventing the accumulation of mitochondria-derived DAMPs, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial DNA [28] [29] [30] (Figure 1 ). Autophagy also removes or prevents leakage of bacterial products from Shigella or Salmonella-containing vacuoles into the cytoplasm, thereby limiting detection of microbial factors in the cytosol by the caspase-11 inflammasome 31,32 . This model is consistent with a role for autophagy in repairing damaged pathogen-containing vacuoles 33 , and the observation that autophagy prevents pyroptosis in the presence of invasive bacteria 32, 34, 35 . In addition to these examples in which autophagy limits the availability of inflammasome activators (ROS, mtDNA, LPS) in the cytosol, one study has shown that SQSTM1 can target the inflammasome subunit ASC for incorporation into an autophagosome, leading to its inactivation 36 . These examples illustrate the critical role of autophagy in suppressing inflammation through the removal of PAMPs, DAMPs, and inflammatory signaling intermediates from the cytosol, a theme that will be reinforced throughout this article.
 NLRs also have a role in inducing autophagy in response to the presence of PAMPs and DAMPs in the cytosol. Sensing of uric acid and nigericin by NLRP3, or recognition of poly(dA:dT) double-stranded DNA by AIM2, induces autophagy by triggering nucleotide exchange on the small GTPase RalB 36 . Amino acid deprivation also signals through RalB to induce autophagy by creating a large multi-protein complex with the exocyst protein Exo84 that links the ULK1 and PI3KC3 complexes 37 . Interestingly, autophagy induction downstream of GCN2, which senses amino acid depletion, dampens inflammasome-mediated intestinal damage following chemical injury 38 . Thus, nutrient sensing pathways may have been repurposed for inducing autophagy during inflammatory stress.
 NLR activation by infectious agents generally induces autophagy. During L. pneumophila infection of macrophages, flagellin that leaks from the vacuole into the cytosol is recognized by NAIP5 and NLRC4, and the formation of the inflammasome complex induces autophagy by releasing beclin-1 from an inhibitory interaction with NLRC4 35 . Also, the NLRP6 inflammasome regulates the composition of the gut microbiota and is required for autophagosome formation in the intestinal epithelium 39 . As discussed later, autophagy induction in epithelial cells is critical to the intestinal barrier. These examples indicate that activation of inflammasomes is coupled with induction of autophagy, which most likely reflects the property of inflammasomes as a double-edged sword, where some activity is essential for defense, but excessive cytokine release and pyroptosis cause irreparable damage to the host. NOD1 and NOD2, the founding members of the NLR family, also induce autophagy. In the presence of bacterial peptidoglycan derivatives, these molecules signal through the adaptor kinase RIP2 to induce NFκB and MAPK signaling. Both NOD1 and NOD2 mediate the recruitment of LC3 to vesicles containing internalized bacteria to initiate xenophagy ( Figure  1 ), although there is disagreement regarding whether this process involves signaling through RIP2 or direct binding between the NLR and ATG16L1 [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] .
 The induction of autophagy following NOD1 and NOD2 activation can dampen the immune response. Specifically, cytokine production by myeloid cells in the presence of bacteria or bacterial ligands that activate NOD2 is increased in the absence of autophagy proteins [46] [47] [48] [49] . NOD2 also recognizes viral RNA, and subsequent RIP2 signaling induces mitophagy through ULK1 phosphorylation. Consequently, NOD2 or RIP2 deficiency increases ROS production by mitochondria and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which exacerbates lung inflammation during influenza virus infection 50 . Similarly, NOD2-RIP2 signaling induces autophagy in alveolar macrophages to suppress inflammation caused by the inflammasome during acute lung injury 51 . Additionally, NOD2 is required for induction of a LAP-like process in dendritic cells (DCs) following internalization of outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from the commensal bacterium Bacteroides fragillus, a process that mediates regulatory T cell differentiation 52 . Although the mechanistic contribution of LAP in this setting remains unclear, this study demonstrates a novel role for non-canonical autophagy in suppressing immune reactions at barrier sites where microbial encounters are common. All together, these studies indicate that a major function of autophagy is to keep the immune system in check by counteracting the pro-inflammatory functions of NLRs.
 Toll-like receptors (TLRs) sense PAMPs at the cell surface or in vesicle lumens, and signal through adaptor proteins MYD88 and/or TRIF to activate TRAF6, which catalyzes lysine 63 (K63) ubiquitination of several signaling intermediates upstream of NFκB and MAPK to induce inflammatory gene expression. Both MYD88 and TRIF signaling promote autophagosome formation (Figure 1) , perhaps explaining why a broad range of TLR ligands are capable of inducing autophagy 53, 54 . Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure, TLR4 promotes the assembly of the PI3KC3 complex through TRAF6-mediated K63 ubiquitination of beclin-1 to free it from an inhibitory interaction with BCL-2 55 . Signaling through MYD88 and NFκB further increase autophagosome maturation by inducing the expression of DRAM1, a lysosomal transmembrane protein involved in lysosomal acidification 56 . The ability to target specific substrates to the autophagosome is facilitated by transcriptional induction of SQSTM1 downstream of TLR4 57 . In addition, LPS-induced SQSTM1 recognizes ubiquitin-tagged mitochondria to promote mitophagy-mediated suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome 30 ( Figure 1 ) and thus, the induction of SQSTM1 explains why NFκB signaling is sometimes counter-intuitively anti-inflammatory. TLR4/ TRIF activation by Gram-negative bacteria can also induce TRAF3-mediated K63 ubiquitination of TBK1, a kinase that phosphorylates optineurin to increase its binding affinity for LC3, thereby promoting xenophagy by crosslinking LC3 and bacteria bound to optineurin 58 . These studies indicate that pathogen-sensing by TLRs triggers multiple signaling events that converge on pathogen and organelle-specific autophagy.
 Importantly, TLR-mediated induction of autophagy has been validated in vivo. Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) triggers autophagy downstream of TLR7 signaling to restrict viral replication in Drosophila melanogaster 59 . In mice, MYD88-dependent induction of autophagy in the intestinal epithelium prevents dissemination of Salmonella 60 . Unlike NLRs in the cytosol, the ability to detect the presence of PAMPs prior to a breach in the membrane may explain why a role for TLR-induced autophagy can be detected as early as 24 hours post-infection in this setting.
 Communication between autophagy and TLRs is bidirectional. Autophagy delivers viral RNA to the endosome for TLR7 recognition in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) 61 . In at least some examples, effector functions downstream of TLRs require LC3 recruitment to phagosomes through LAP (Figure 1 ). When antibody-bound DNA complexes are internalized by pDCs and bind Fcγ receptor (FcγR), LAP mediates the maturation of the phagosome to a vesicle that supports type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling downstream of TLR9 62 . The acidification of phagosomes containing TLR2 ligands in macrophages also occurs through LAP 63 . Melanin on the cell wall of the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus inhibits ROS production by the NADPH oxidase, which together with TLR recognition of fungal surface molecules, is a necessary step in recruiting autophagy proteins. However, A. fumigatus is unable to evade LAP upon removal of melanin during germination, and is ultimately degraded 8, 64 . These findings demonstrate how autophagy and LAP support vesicle trafficking events that are critical for TLR-mediated cytokine production and pathogen degradation.
 In contrast to the above examples, there are situations in which autophagy proteins and TLRs have an antagonistic relationship. SQSTM1 serves a dual function as both an adaptor molecule for autophagy and a scaffolding protein that binds TRAF6 to mediate NFkB signaling downstream of TLRs 65 . In keratinocytes, SQSTM1 is targeted for autophagic degradation by virtue of binding to LC3, thereby disrupting TLR4 and TLR2 signaling 66 . In another example of autophagy and TLR antagonism, MYD88 signaling upon TLR2 recognition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces a microRNA (miRNA) that inhibits autophagy by targeting UVRAG, a subunit of the PI3K3C complex, resulting in increased bacterial survival 67 . Unlike the extensive antagonistic relationship observed between NLRs and autophagy, these situations in which autophagy and TLR signaling inhibit one another have thus far been exceptions and may apply to specific cell types or pathogens.
 While autophagy proteins typically promote TLR signaling in the presence of vesicle-bound nucleic acid, autophagy proteins mediate mitophagy to inhibit signaling downstream of cytosolic sensors of viral nucleic acid. RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I and MDA5 sense double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the cytosol and signal through the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which oligomerizes on the mitochondrial outer-membrane to induce IFN-I expression by activating the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. Mitophagy suppresses IFN-I production by removing the platform for RLR signaling and causes degradation of signaling intermediates such as MAVS [68] [69] [70] (Figure 2a) . ROS produced by accumulating mitochondria also contributes to excess IFN-I production when mitophagy is inhibited 71 . When MAVS signaling is triggered by viral infection, the ATG16L1 complex is recruited to mitochondria by NLRX1, TUFM, and COX5b 68,70 (Figure 2a) . For this reason, cells deficient in autophagy proteins, NLRX1, or COX5b display enhanced IFN-I production and are better able to restrict the replication of a variety of viruses [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] . Presumably, mitophagy is coupled to detection of cytosolic RNA to prevent sustained pathological IFN-I production, but this model has not been formally demonstrated.
 Autophagy also intersects with pathways responsible for sensing cytosolic DNA, which is associated with viral infection, intracellular bacteria, and autoimmunity. Cyclic dinucleotides generated by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) in the presence of dsDNA activate the transmembrane protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to induce IFN-I expression. STING colocalizes with autophagy proteins including LC3, and loss of ATG9L1 leads to aberrant STING trafficking and activation 73 . However, STING function was unaffected by deletion of the E1-like enzyme ATG7 73 , implicating a non-canonical autophagy pathway in membrane trafficking events during dsDNA recognition. Also, ULK1 phosphorylates STING to inhibit IRF3 and aberrant IFN-I expression 74 (Figure 2b ). Similar to autophagy induction during glucose starvation, cyclic dinucleotides induce AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, which leads to phosphorylation and activation of ULK1, thus serving as a negative feedback loop 74 . During herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection, beclin-1 binds and inhibits cGAS. This interaction simultaneously frees beclin-1 from inhibition by rubicon (run domain Beclin-1-interacting and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein) to enhance PI3KC3 activity and autophagy-mediated degradation of viral DNA, thus reducing both the amount of cytosolic DNA and the downstream signaling 75 (Figure 2b ). Autophagy also prevents pathological STING activation by targeting damaged DNA that leaks from the nucleus to the lysosome where it is degraded by DNASE2a 76 .
 Spontaneous IFN-I signaling occurs upon autophagy inhibition in intestinal tissue and tumor cells 24, 77, 78 , indicating that autophagy in some organs or cell types is constitutively suppressing cytokine release. An IFN-I signature in the absence of an infectious trigger could reflect an inappropriate immune response to host nucleic acid, the microbiota, or endogenous retroviruses. Given our growing appreciation of the contribution of IFN-I to cancer and autoimmunity, this autophagy-mediated control of cytokine expression under steady-state conditions is likely relevant to situations beyond infectious disease.
 Consistent with the role of autophagy in supporting cellular immunity, the Th1 cytokines interferon-γ (IFNγ) and TNFα generally upregulate xenophagy in target cells [79] [80] [81] . IFNγ induces autophagy through the JAK1/JAK2 and p38 MAPK pathway independently of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) 82 . In turn, autophagy promotes IFNγ signaling by limiting ROS production, which if left to accumulate, would activate the JAK/STAT inhibitory phosphatase SHP2 83 (Figure 2c ). In addition to conventional autophagy, IFNγ induces a LAP-like process in hepatocytes infected by the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax. The deposition of LC3 onto the parasitophorous vacuole leads to the recruitment of lysosomes and killing of the parasite 84 . As mentioned earlier, IFNγ suppress T. gondii and norovirus replication through an incompletely understood type of noncanonical autophagy [9] [10] [11] . Therefore, IFNγ induces canonical and non-canonical autophagy to inhibit intracellular pathogen replication.
 Cytokines that signal through other STAT molecules do not necessarily induce autophagy. Binding of protein kinase R (PKR) by STAT3 prevents PKR-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α, a stress-responsive regulator of translation that promotes autophagy 85 (Figure 2c ). As seen with IL-10, any cytokine that activates STAT3 can theoretically interfere with autophagy 86 . STAT6 signaling downstream of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 also inhibits autophagy induction by IFNγ in macrophages 80 . However, DCs differentiated in the presence of IL-4 display increased expression of RUFY4, a positive regulator of autophagosome growth and fusion with lysosomes 87 . The amount of time the cell is exposed to Th2 cytokines, and the presence of other cytokines such as IFNγ and GM-CSF, may explain these contradictory effects of Th2 cytokines on autophagy. These studies establish a link between autophagy and Th2 or regulatory cytokines. How this impacts host defense requires further investigation.
 Autophagy inhibits IL-1β production by repressing inflammasome activation, but can facilitate the secretion of this cytokine 88 . IL-1β does not undergo conventional secretion due to the absence of a signal peptide, but can pass through a permeabilized plasma membrane 89 . Alternatively, when membrane integrity is intact, IL-1β can be incorporated into the space between the inner-and outer-membrane of the autophagosome, and is released from the cell following autophagosome fusion with the plasma membrane or multivesicular body 90 (Figure 2d ). IL-1β is ultimately secreted from autophagy-deficient cells, likely because of the permeabilized membrane accompanying increased inflammasome activity and pyroptosis.
 Secreted IL-1β, in turn, activates autophagy through TBK1 91 (Figure 2d ). IL-1β (also IL-1α and IFNγ) induces ubiquitination of beclin-1, suggesting that it can also activate autophagy through a mechanism similar to LPS (Figure 1) . Finally, secretion of other IL-1 family members, specifically IL-1α and MIF, is increased in autophagy-deficient macrophages as a downstream consequence of mitochondrial ROS accumulation 92, 93 . It is likely that autophagy induction following the engagement of the IL-1R is another mechanism of negative feedback through ROS suppression.
 Autophagy may be particularly important for preventing Th17 responses because the cytokines that are suppressed by autophagy are key to inducing IL-17 expression by T cells: IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-18, IL-23, IL-6, TGFβ, and MIF 47,92-95 . Excess IL-1α released by autophagy-deficient macrophages induces Th17 differentiation and exacerbates lung inflammation during M. tuberculosis infection (Figure 3) . Similarly, IL-1β produced downstream of autophagy inhibition in DCs acts in an autocrine manner to mediate IL-23 production, leading to IL-17 secretion by γδT cells 94 . There is less evidence that Th1 and other branches of adaptive immunity benefit from autophagy-deficiency in macrophages and DCs. One reason may be that IFN-I, which is over-produced upon autophagy-inhibition, is known to inhibit IFNγ activity 96 . An inflammatory milieu could also cause T cell exhaustion. As discussed later, the role of autophagy in antigen presentation is another variable that requires consideration.
 Cell death can lead to extracellular release of DAMPs that are confined within the cell, such as nucleic acids, ATP, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and IL-1β. Autophagy is induced by ATP, and controls the secretion of ATP. Purinergic receptors and transporters that recognize exogenous ATP triggers autophagy through AMPK-mediated mTOR inhibition and dephosphorylation of AKT 97-100 . Prior to cell death, autophagy regulates the secretion of ATP by mediating the migration of ATP-containing lysosomes towards the plasma membrane 101 . Due to the importance of ATP as a chemotactic signal, loss of autophagy in tumor cells diminishes the ability of chemotherapeutic agents to trigger a robust anti-tumor immune response (Figure 3 ) 102 .
 Like IL-1β, autophagy facilitates the release of HMGB1, a chromatin-associated nuclear protein, from stressed or dying tumor cells 103 . Extracellular HMGB1 is recognized by receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), resulting in decreased mTOR activity and increased autophagy 104 . Nuclear HMGB1 regulates the expression of heat shock protein b 1 (HSPB1), a chaperone protein that promotes mitophagy 105 . Also, HMGB1 translocates to the cytosol in the presence of ROS, where it induces autophagy by releasing beclin-1 from inhibition by BCL-2 103 . Endogenous HMGB1 can also promote autophagy by protecting beclin-1 and ATG5 from calpain-mediated cleavage 106 . Thus, when HMGB1 is removed from macrophages or intestinal epithelial cells, the balance shifts from autophagy to apoptosis, and favors exaggerated cytokine production to increase inflammation 106, 107 .
 To summarize, an extensive amount of crosstalk has been observed between autophagy and immune signaling cascades downstream of the array of receptors that recognize PAMPs, DAMPs, and cytokines. The finding that autophagy is sometimes necessary for IFN-I production (e.g., by functioning together with TLRs in pDCs) but can also dampen IFN-I signaling (e.g., through mitophagy) reinforces the fact that the relationship between autophagy and a given immune pathway is context-dependent and not generalizable. However, one recurring observation is that pathways that induce autophagy are often inhibited by autophagy to prevent sustained activation. This role of autophagy in negative feedback is most obvious in the presence of inflammasome substrates and viral nucleic acids in the cytosol, where autophagy limits the amount of cytokines produced. This function is not mutually exclusive from antimicrobial functions of autophagy such as xenophagy; removing the infectious threat and removing the PAMP that triggers the inflammatory response are both ways to restore homeostasis.
 A role for autophagy can be seen in virtually all the cell types that participate in adaptive immunity -lymphocytes, antigen presenting cells (APCs), dying cells, and cells that contribute to the inflammatory milieu ( Figure 3) . Autophagy, most likely through mitochondrial quality control, is necessary for the survival and proliferation of T cells (CD4, CD8, and NK T cells) [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] , memory responses of CD8 T cells, and activated NK cell maintenance [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] . In effector CD4 T cells, autophagy activity generates the ATP necessary to produce IL-2 and IFN-γ 120 . Autophagy may have analogous functions in maintaining organelle and metabolic homeostasis in the B cell lineage because Atg5 deletion leads to an absence of B-1a B cells and a defect in antibody production by plasma cells [121] [122] [123] . The induction of autophagy in naïve CD4 T cells following TCR stimulation is dependent on mTOR inhibition downstream of the ubiquitin editing enzyme TNFAIP3 (A20) 114 . TCR engagement also induces autophagy-mediated degradation of the upstream NFκB signaling molecule BCL-10, thus preventing hyperactivation of effector T cells 124 . Inhibiting autophagy in regulatory T cells (Tregs) causes apoptosis and lineage instability due to aberrant metabolism, which leads to unrestrained Th2 responses and inflammation at intestinal barrier sites 125, 126 . As expected, the role of autophagy in supporting these various lymphocyte lineages is necessary for optimal immune responses to viruses, parasites, selfantigens, and tumors 115, 122, 125, 126 .
 On the APC side, autophagy affects the repertoire of peptides presented on MHC-II molecules 127 , including by thymic epithelial cells that mediate selection of developing T cells 128 . Specific antigens have been shown to depend on autophagy for presentation. Autophagosomes transport peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) that convert arginine to citrulline, which generates the citrullinated self-peptides implicated in rheumatoid arthritis 129 (Figure 3 ). Autophagy in virally-infected cells generate antigens for presentation to CD4 T cells by delivering cytosolic proteins to the lysosome for antigen processing, such as the Epstein-Barr virus protein EBNA-1 130 (Figure 3 ). In some cases, antigens are generated from ubiquitinated protein aggregates and pathogen-containing vacuoles that are recognized by SQSTM1, which become substrates for either MHC-I or MHC-II presentation 131, 132 . Autophagy can be augmented to enhance antigen presentation through previously discussed signals, such as IFN-γ and NOD2 activation 41, 131, 132 . Autophagy or LAP is also critical for the processing of exogenous antigens by mediating the fusion of phagosomes containing TLR ligands or apoptotic corpses with lysosomes in DCs 133-135 ( Figure 3 ). This process is necessary for MHC-II presentation that drives the antiviral Th1 response during herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) infection 136 . It is possible that avoidance of CD4 T cell recognition is a major reason why some pathogens encode proteins that inhibit autophagy. For instance, the HSV-1 protein ICP34.5 binds beclin-1 to inhibit autophagymediated MHC-II antigen presentation in DCs 137 .
 Challenge with the yellow fever virus vaccine YF-17D induces autophagy in DCs through induction of the amino acid starvation sensor GCN2. Inhibiting either autophagy proteins or GCN2 impairs the ability of DCs to mediate proliferation of CD8 T cells when co-cultured with infected cells 138 (Figure 3) , providing a clinically relevant example of autophagydependent MHC-I cross-presentation. However, as with certain examples of antigen presentation on MHC-II, the role for autophagy proteins revealed by this study may be more likely to reflect LAP rather than autophagy. Now that the tools are available, future studies will be able to distinguish the role of canonical versus non-canonical forms of autophagy in antigen presentation.
 Genetic variants that occur near or within autophagy genes are implicated in several inflammatory disorders ( Table 1) . One of the first indicators that autophagy dysfunction contributes to inflammatory disease was provided by the genetic link between Crohn's disease and a common polymorphism in ATG16L1 139 . The disease polymorphism results in a threonine to alanine coding change (T300A) that destabilizes the ATG16L1 protein product by introducing a caspase-3 cleavage site 48, 49 . The function of autophagy in inhibiting cytokine production is consistent with the idea that this disease stems from an exaggerated immune response directed towards the gut microbiota. Additionally, inhibiting autophagy within the intestinal epithelium causes defects in antimicrobial granule formation by Paneth cells and mucus secretion by goblet cells 19, [140] [141] [142] . Together with xenophagy, the role of autophagy in maintaining these secretory cell lineages helps prevent breaches of the epithelial barrier by Salmonella and commensal bacteria 60, 143 . The relevance of these epithelial-specific functions of autophagy is supported by the observation that knock-in mice harboring the ATG16L1 T300A disease variant are susceptible to enteric bacterial infections, and display defects in Paneth cells and goblet cells 48, 49 . Also, the crosstalk between the ER stress pathway and autophagy in Paneth cells was shown to have a central role in preventing intestinal inflammation 142 , directly implicating the organelle homeostasis function of autophagy in this secretory cell type.
 The same ATG16L1 T300A polymorphism increases the risk of death following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) 144 . Autophagy was found to prevent lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a preclinical animal model of HSCT by suppressing DC hyperactivity. These autophagy-deficient DCs displayed alterations in the expression of genes implicated in endolysosomal trafficking including those that affect NFκB and MAPK signaling 144 . The reason why autophagy suppresses rather than promotes the ability of DCs to stimulate T cells in this situation is likely explained by differences between allogeneic and syngeneic T cell activation, where the former has less constraints on the antigen being presented. Given that GVHD frequently affects the gut, it would be interesting to determine whether autophagy in the intestinal epithelium also has a role in preventing disease following HSCT.
 Polymorphisms associated with increased ATG5 expression are linked to asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 145, 146 . Although it remains possible that these polymorphisms act through neighboring genes and not ATG5, autophagy contributes to biological processes that are relevant to these disorders including regulation of the cytokine milieu and antigen presentation. In airway epithelial cells, autophagy mediates goblet cell differentiation and mucus secretion in response to IL-13 147 , suggesting that enhanced autophagy contributes to the pathological overproduction of mucus observed in asthmatic individuals.
 Markers of increased autophagy have been observed in B and T lymphocytes from SLE patients 148, 149 , which could reflect genetic predisposition, or an attempt to stem further cytokine production. The multi-organ inflammation observed in SLE is associated with immune complexes consisting of antibodies bound to nucleic acid and histones, which induce aberrant IFN-I production following recognition by the DNA and RNA sensors TLR7 and TLR9. LAP, which is dependent on ATG5, mediates the delivery of such immune complexes in pDCs, resulting in TLR9 activation and IFN-I production 62 . Also, ATG5 in B cells is necessary for TLR7-dependent generation of autoantibodies and SLE pathologies, hinting at an early role for autophagy proteins in disease progression 150 . In myeloid cells, ATG5 and other autophagy proteins prevent the production of self-reactive antibodies. Dying cells are not properly degraded by macrophages in LAP-deficient mice, leading to a general increase in serological markers of inflammation and signs of SLE as the animals age 151 . Of note, among the different LAP-deficient mice used in this study were rubicon knockouts, which display increased autophagy. One interpretation of this result is that loss of LAP in myeloid cells is more significant in the development of SLE (in aged mice) than a potential increase in lymphocyte autophagy. Studies that examine the effect of specifically increasing autophagy in B cells are warranted.
 The list of immunological diseases accompanied by autophagy dysfunction extends beyond those caused by mutations in autophagy genes. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) occurs in individuals harboring loss of function mutations in subunits of the NADPH oxidase, which is necessary for generating ROS and recruiting LC3 to the phagosome 152 . Monocytes from CGD patients are defective in LAP-mediated control of A. fumigatus 64 .
 Similarly, APCs deficient in NAPDH oxidase activity display reduced MHC-I and MHC-II presentation of fungal antigens 133, 153 . Cells from CGD patients also display defects in autophagy-mediated suppression of IL-1β in the presence of the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi 47 . This failure of autophagy-mediated control of IL-1β production contributes to Th17-driven colitis in CGD patients, which can be treated with an antibody against IL-1R (anakinra) 154 .
 A defect in pathogen handling through autophagy may also explain why individuals with Niemen-Pick disease type C 1 (NPC1), a lysosomal storage disorder, sometimes develop granulomatous inflammation in the intestine that resembles Crohn's disease. NPC1 mutation inhibits NOD2-mediated xenophagy 155 . In another example, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor (CFTR) mutation leads to sequestration of the PI3KC3 complex into protein aggregates and downregulation of autophagy 156 . This block in autophagy potentially contributes to chronic lung inflammation and recurring pulmonary infections characteristic of CF. Indeed, CFTR mutation increases susceptibility of macrophages to Burkholderia cenocepacia infection and exacerbates IL-1β production 157 . Autophagy inhibition in CF patients is further exacerbated upon treatment with the antibiotic azithromycin, which is associated with increased infection by nontuberculous mycobacteria 158 . Thus, restoration of autophagy may ameliorate many chronic inflammatory disorders.
 Autophagy and related processes regulate intracellular trafficking of pathogens, production of inflammatory mediators, and viability of cells that coordinate immunity. Through these functions, the autophagy machinery controls complex multicellular immune responses at the whole organism level. The literature highlighted in this article reinforces three themes related to how these functions of autophagy are integrated into inflammatory signaling cascades to ensure an appropriate response to environmental threats and a return to homeostasis: (1) pathways that induce autophagy are subject to regulation by autophagy, (2) autophagy can increase and decrease different parts of the same inflammatory signaling cascade in a context-dependent manner, and (3) non-canonical autophagy is pervasive. Although these principles apply to the role of autophagy in other situations, they are perhaps most obvious in the recent literature examining the function of autophagy proteins in host defense and inflammatory disease.
 These three themes have implications for the clinical application of autophagy inducers and inhibitors. Short-term induction of autophagy is effective in reducing the burden of intracellular pathogens 16 , and can simultaneously enhance TLR-mediated cytokine production and antigen presentation by DCs to improve adaptive immunity 138 . Treating chronic infections is potentially more challenging and will require consideration of the bidirectional communication between autophagy and inflammation. Also, given the regulatory role of autophagy in immunity, it may be reasonable to ask whether autophagy is actually beneficial for host defense. It is important to remind ourselves that the measure of an effective immune response is not how vigorous it is, but how efficiently the threat is neutralized without damaging the host. Therefore, the role of autophagy in reducing inflammation is not necessarily counterproductive to the role of autophagy in reducing pathogen burden.
 Treating complex inflammatory disorders by modulating autophagy has similar challenges. Prior to considering this strategy, it is important to identify the physiological situations in which the net effect of autophagy on the level of IL-1β, IFN-I, and other cytokines is positive versus negative. It is also equally necessary to determine the cell types and organs most affected by autophagy activity. Although the discovery of non-canonical forms of autophagy has increased the complexity of the field, we may be able to exploit the subtle differences in the function of different parts of the autophagy machinery. Indeed, deleting some autophagy genes in macrophages leads to a more pronounced inflammatory outcome than others 25, 151 , perhaps indicating that inhibition of certain parts of the pathway can be compensated by other membrane trafficking processes, and that some autophagy proteins have partially redundant functions. It may be possible to target different nodes of the autophagy pathway without broadly affecting all the downstream immune functions of autophagy proteins.
 Finally, defects in autophagy coincide with aging, metabolic disease, cancer, myopathies, and neurodegenerative disorders. Indeed, transgenic mice engineered to overexpress Atg5 display increased lifespan, and improvements in glucose sensitivity and motor function 159 . If humans are to receive autophagy-based treatments for these conditions associated with aging, it will be necessary to understand the effect of altered autophagy on inflammation, which universally accompanies maladies.

 Key points
 The cellular degradative process of autophagy participates in multiple aspects of immunity, including cell autonomous defense, innate immune signaling, and antigen presentation.
 • Extensive crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory signaling cascades ensures a robust immune response towards pathogens while avoiding collateral damage to the host. Several chronic inflammatory disorders are associated with autophagy dysfunction.
 • Pathways that induce autophagy, such as those downstream of pattern recognition receptors, are subject to regulation by autophagy.
 • Autophagy can increase and decrease different parts of the same inflammatory signaling cascade in a context-dependent manner.
 • Many immune-related functions of conserved autophagy proteins reflect noncanonical forms of autophagy, representing new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

 Following LPS activation of TLR4, MYD88 and TRIF signal through TRAF6 and TRAF3 to facilitate autophagy by inducing: (i) the release of Beclin-1 from inhibition by BCL-2, (ii) phosphorylation and activation of optineurin (OPTN) through TBK-1, and (iii) transcription of SQSTM1 and the autophagosome maturation protein DRAM1 downstream of NFκB signaling (see figure) . Recognition of internalized fungal glycans and antibody-bound DNA complexes by TLR2 and the Fcγ chain receptor (FcγR) triggers LAP. As the phagosome matures, the fungal pathogen is degraded and TLR9 signals through interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and type I interferon (IFN-I) transcription. NOD2 in the cytosol recognizes bacterial peptidoglycan or viral RNA from internalized pathogens and subsequently induces autophagy, either by signaling through RIP2 or by directly recruiting ATG16L1 in a complex with IRGM. Incorporation of the bacteria into the autophagosome is achieved by the LC3 binding proteins SQSTM1, OPTN, NDP52, and others, which recognize the damaged vacuole tagged by ubiquitin (Ub) and galectin-8 (Gal-8). In addition to inhibiting pathogen replication, this process reduces leakage of bacterial LPS to prevent activation of the casapse-11 inflammasome. Autophagy also inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other factors produced by damaged mitochondria following exposure to exogenous agents including uric acid crystals, ATP, and bacterial toxins. The autophagosome sequesters damaged mitochondria and the NLRP3 binding protein ASC to prevent caspase-1 mediated cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its active form.
 Several examples have been reported in which autophagy regulates cytokine production, or is subject to regulation by cytokines. Viral RNA (vRNA) recognition by RIG-I induces mitochondrial ROS production and MAVS signaling, leading to IFN-I transcription.
 Mitophagy following recruitment of the ATG16L1 complex by NLRX1 and TUFM (or COX5B, not shown) inhibits this pathway by removing the MAVS signaling platform and inhibiting ROS production (a). cGAS converts cytosolic DNA (from viruses, bacteria or host) to cGAMP for recognition by STING and subsequent IFN-I signaling. cGAS activates ULK1, which mediates an inhibitory phosphorylation of STING. Also, binding between beclin-1 and cGAS allows beclin-1 to induce autophagy through the PI3KC3 activity to remove the cytosolic DNA and simultaneously inhibits cGAS-dependent IFN-I production (b). IFN-γ induces autophagy through JAK1, JAK2, and p38. This pathway is reinforced by mitophogy because mitochondrial ROS activates SHP-2, an inhibitor of IFN-γ signaling. IL-10 can inhibit autophagy by promoting binding between STAT3 and PKR, which inhibits activation of eIF2α (c). In addition to suppressing IL-1β production by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome, autophagy mediates the secretion of IL-1β. Extracellular IL-1β signals through the IL-1R and MYD88 to induce autophagy, and autophagosome maturation and degradation of engulfed material including intracellular bacteria is dependent on TBK1 (d).

 Autophagy activity in T cells, antigen presenting cells (APCs), and dying cells affects T cell immunity. Autophagy in APCs such as dendritic cells delivers intracellular and extracellular antigens to endo-lysosomal vesicles where it can intersect the MHC-II presentation pathway and stimulate a CD4 + T cell response. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) in autophagosomes generate citrullinated peptides, thereby affecting the repertoire of antigens being presented. Extracellular antigens can also be delivered to the endoso-lysosome by LAP. Autophagy-mediated release of ATP by dying cells, such as those infected by viruses, leads to engulfment by the APC. Internalized antigens from the dying cell can then be crosspresented on MHC-I molecules to stimulate CD8+ T cells, a process mediated by autophagy or potentially LAP downstream of GCN2 activation. The removal of ROS producing mitochondria inhibits calpain-mediated processing of IL-1α, thereby decreasing Th17 differentiation of CD4+ T cells by secreted IL-1α. Naïve CD4 + T cells require autophagy for survival and proliferation, and cytokine production once activated. The establishment of memory by CD8 + T cells is also dependent on autophagy.

53,53,5aa859a4b76d8fc207a7eed9296368c42778cdc9,,Organ-specific features of natural killer cells NIH Public Access,"Natural killer (NK) cells can be swiftly mobilized by danger signals and are among the earliest arrivals at target organs of disease. However, the role of NK cells in mounting inflammatory responses is often complex and sometimes paradoxical. Here, we examine the divergent phenotypic and functional features of NK cells, as deduced largely from experimental mouse models of pathophysiological responses in the liver, mucosal tissues, uterus, pancreas, joints and brain. Moreover, we discuss how organ-specific factors, the local microenvironment and unique cellular interactions may influence the organ-specific properties of NK cells.
 Infection and autoimmunity are two common pathological processes, during which inflammation might be elicited in an organ-specific manner. Microorganisms can infect specific organs and induce inflammatory responses. Frequently, the host immune response against the invading pathogens may also cause tissue damage owing to bystander effects. Moreover, inflammation can sometimes trigger organ-specific autoimmune diseases or even malignant transformation of the affected organ.
 Among the many cell types of the immune system, natural killer cells (NK cells) are one of the earliest cell types to arrive at target organs of inflammation 1 . The role of NK cells in modulating inflammatory responses in different organs is often complex, not always completely understood and sometimes even paradoxical 2-4 . For example, some studies have shown that NK cells may promote insulitis, destroy insulin-producing islet cells and promote the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) 5-8 . In sharp contrast, other studies have shown that NK cells may inhibit the intensity of inflammatory responses within the central nervous","system (CNS) [9] [10] [11] [12] . In rheumatoid arthritis, however, both inhibitory and promoting roles for NK cells have been reported 13, 14 . Although different NK cell subsets or functions might be involved during different stages of the inflammatory process 2,3 , emerging evidence indicates that additional elements, such as organ-specific factors and cellular interactions, may also influence the divergent functions of NK cells in different organs and during different pathological conditions. Bone marrow-derived NK cell precursors undergo a maturation process that leads to the acquisition of their effector functions, changes in the expression of chemotactic receptors and adhesion molecules, and their migration from the bone marrow through the blood to the spleen, liver, lung and many other organs. The distribution of NK cells is not static because these cells can recirculate between organs 15 . Owing to the expression of chemokine receptors, such as CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), CCR5, CXC-chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) and CX 3 C-chemokine receptor 1 (CX 3 CR1), NK cells can respond to a large array of chemokines 16 , and thus they can be recruited to distinct sites of inflammation [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] and extravagate to the parenchyma or body cavities. In contrast to B cells, T cells and dendritic cells (DCs), the detailed trafficking patterns of NK cells are not very well characterized.
 Nevertheless, it appears that chemokines produced by cells that are unique to specific organs may have a role in orchestrating NK cell migration to each organ. For example, the CX 3 Cchemokine ligand 1 (CX 3 CL1; also known as fractalkine) produced by neurons is necessary and sufficient to guide CX 3 CR1-bearing NK cells to the inflamed brain 10, 26 . Similarly, Kupffer cell-derived CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2; also known as MCP1) attracts CCR2expressing NK cells to the liver during murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection 27, 28 . The production of unique chemokines by organ-specific cell types for the recruitment of NK cells (TABLE 1) suggests that organ-intrinsic elements may be important in shaping NK cell homing during physiological and pathological conditions.
 In this article, we discuss recent research on organ-specific NK cells and argue that organintrinsic factors shape the cellular, molecular and functional features of NK cells in organspecific inflammation. The impact of the local environment in tumours on NK cells will not be discussed here because this topic has been extensively covered elsewhere 29, 30 .
 NK cells can be divided into functionally distinct subsets, which differ between humans and mice. Human NK cells can be functionally classified based on the levels of CD56 and CD16 expression. Most circulating NK cells are CD56 low CD16 + , and can kill target cells and produce cytokines following specific recognition of their targets 31, 32 . By contrast, CD56 hi CD16 − NK cells, which are the predominant NK cell subset in peripheral lymphoid organs, produce large amounts of cytokines -including interferon-γ(IFNγ), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)following stimulation by pro-inflammatory cytokines and acquire cytotoxicity only after prolonged activation 31, 32 . It has been shown that the CD56 hi CD16 − NK cells can differentiate into CD56 low CD16 + NK cells, and recent studies have revealed that CD56 low CD16 + NK cells can undergo further differentiation and functional modification with time [33] [34] [35] .
 Mouse NK cells share many characteristics with human NK cells, but the lack of CD56 expression and other surface markers on mouse NK cells makes it difficult to identify functionally comparable NK cell populations in mice. Nevertheless, mouse NK cells can be classified based on expression of CD11b (also known as αM integrin), CD27, CD127 and B220 (REFS [36] [37] [38] . There is evidence that CD11b hi CD27 + and CD11b hi CD27 − NK cell subsets in mice differ in the expression of activating and inhibitory receptors and chemokine receptors, with the CD11b hi CD27 + NK cell subset exhibiting the highest levels of both cytokine production and cytotoxicity 39 . Mouse NK cells that express the interleukin-7 (IL-7) receptor CD127 resemble human CD56 hi CD16 − NK cells in that they produce copious amounts of cytokines and only acquire cytotoxic activities after prolonged activation. Furthermore, B220 + CD11c + NK cells are enriched in secondary lymphoid tissues and secrete higher levels of IFNγ than other mouse NK cells [36] [37] [38] .
 More recently, NKp46 (also known as NCR1) has been identified as a common marker for human and murine NK cells. However, some subsets of innate lymphocytes that are distinct from NK cells have also been found to express NKp46 (BOX 1).
 Recent studies have identified several subsets of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that are developmentally related and evolutionarily conserved 124 . This family of cells includes natural killer (NK) cells, lymphoid tissue-inducer (LTi) cells (which produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) and/or IL-22), natural helper cells and nuocytes (which produce IL-5 and IL-13), and cells with characteristics of both NK cells and LTi cells. These latter cells, which have been referred to as NK-like cells or ILC22 cells, share with NK cells the expression of the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp46 (but not NK1.1) and with LTi cells the expression of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt). However, although NK cells generally produce interferon-γ and are cytotoxic, NKp46 + RORγt + ILCs produce IL-22 and are non-cytotoxic. Several subsets of ILCs are enriched in mucosal tissues, particularly in the gut.
 NK cells have a crucial role in antiviral immunity; LTi cells are important for the development of lymph nodes during embryogenesis, tissue remodelling, homeostasis of epithelia and host defence; and natural helper cells and nuocytes have been implicated in immunity to extracellular parasites and in the development of asthma. However, the functions of NKp46 + RORγt + ILCs remain unclear.
 NK cells are activated by target cells following the detection of missing or altered expression of self MHC class I molecules. NK cell activation can occur through three mechanisms: by engagement of the Fc portion of IgG antibodies that decorate cells; by the sensing of altered molecules on stressed cells; or by an inflammatory environment that is rich in cytokines, such as IL-12 or type I IFNs 40, 41 . Cytotoxicity against infected or transformed cells and production of cytokines are the main effector functions of NK cells.
 The liver represents a unique immunological environment, in which constant exposure to gut-derived antigens does not result in inflammation. In the liver, NK cells are preferentially located in the hepatic sinusoids, often adhering to the endothelial cells 42 . In mice, 5-10% of hepatic lymphocytes are NK cells, whereas, strikingly, up to 30-50% of all human hepatic lymphocytes are NK cells. Moreover, studies in mice have shown that the number of NK cells changes substantially in different experimental models of liver diseases. For example, mice infected with viral pathogens show profound accumulation of NK cells in the liver 28, 43 . Likewise, administration of polyI:C (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid; a synthetic version of double-stranded RNA) also induces NK cell accumulation in the liver. The chemokines CCL2, CCL3 (also known as MIP1α) and CXC-chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), which are produced by liver-resident cells, can recruit NK cells expressing CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR5 and CXCR3 to the liver under various pathological conditions 16 .
 Whereas CD11b + CD27 − NK cells predominate in the peripheral blood of mice, CD11b − CD27 + NK cells are found at greater proportions in the liver 44 . Another hallmark of liver NK cells, compared with NK cells in peripheral blood, is the expression of the inhibitory receptor natural killer group 2, member A (NKG2A), which interacts with the MHC class I-related protein Qa-1 in mice (HLA-E in humans). Expression of NKG2A on NK cells may contribute to liver tolerance 42 .
 The characteristics of NK cells in different organs may reflect their ability to adapt to different micro-environments. In support of this notion, splenic NK cells can migrate to the liver following adoptive transfer, where they adopt a phenotype and function that closely resembles that of liver-resident NK cells 44 . The recent discovery that NK cells are capable of antigen-specific immunological memory in humans and mice further suggests that NK cells are more versatile than previously anticipated [45] [46] [47] [48] . This is well reflected by hepatic NK cells, as they can acquire and retain antigen-specific memory against haptens and virusderived antigens even in the absence of antigen persistence 49, 50 . Memory NK cells specific for such antigens are enriched in the liver (FIG. 1) and crucially depend on expression of CXCR6, a receptor for the chemokine CXCL16 (which is produced by the endothelium of liver sinusoids 50 ). In addition to its role in NK cell-mediated memory, tonic engagement of CXCR6 protects the liver from NK cell-mediated hepatotoxicity by regulating the killing activity of NK cells 50 .
 Finally, the chronic stages of hepatic infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV) promote the appearance of NK cells with increased levels of TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), NKp44 (also known as NCR2), NKG2C and CD122 (REFS 49, 50) .
 NK cells may assist in maintaining liver tolerance through their interactions with various cell types. For example, NK cells co-cultured with hepatocytes have been described to promote the capacity of DCs to induce CD4 + regulatory T (T Reg ) cells 51 . The induction of T Reg cells by DCs in the presence of NK cells is dependent on NKG2A engagement on NK cells during their co-culture with hepatocytes 52 .
 Kupffer cells, which are mainly localized around the periportal regions in the liver, function as hepatic tissue macrophages and are crucial for endotoxin removal from the blood. Treatment of Kupffer cells with lipo-polysaccharide (LPS) results in high levels of IL-10 production, which leads to decreased NK cell activation. It has been suggested that IL-10mediated induction of NKG2A in liver NK cells might regulate liver NK cell function 42 (FIG. 1) . Although the timing and physiological circumstances under which IL-10 is released by Kupffer cells require further investigation, it is presumed that Kupffer cells produce IL-10 to downregulate the immune responses orchestrated by NK cells and other immune cells during late stages of inflammation to avoid bystander hepatic damage.
 The presence of IFNα, IFNγ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-18 in the inflamed liver largely contributes to an activated phenotype of NK cells, whereas IL-15 and IL-2 may sustain the survival and activation of these cells (FIG. 1) . Among the liver-resident cells that can provide a source of these cytokines, hepatic natural killer T cells (NKT cells) can release large amounts of IFNγ, and Kupffer cells primarily release CCL2, IL-6 and other acute proinflammatory mediators (FIG. 1) . As mentioned above, Kupffer cells can also release IL-10 (REF. 53 ), which induces expression of NKG2A 51 . The liver encounters relatively high levels of LPS derived from the gut, which could be potentially harmful. Interestingly, it has been reported that crosstalk between Toll-like receptor (TLR) and complement receptor signalling pathways inhibits IL-12 production, and this may have a role in dampening excessive NK cell activation 54, 55 .
 Chronic liver disease is often associated with the development of fibrosis, a wound-healing process. Fibrosis is characterized by the formation of new blood vessels, sinusoidal remodelling and pericyte (stellate cell) proliferation 56 . Hepatic stellate cells are activated following the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies and cell debris, leading to their differentiation, proliferation and pro-fibrotic progression. NK cells have been suggested to be involved in hepatic stellate cell death, as depletion of NK cells leads to enhanced fibrosis in a mouse experimental model 42 . Interestingly, of the many pro-apoptotic molecules investigated in activated hepatic stellate cells, the upregulation of TRAIL receptors, which can bind NK cell-derived cytotoxic ligands may be crucial 57 .
 The finding that NKG2A expression is increased on NK cells from patients chronically infected with HCV suggests a role for these cells in maintaining the persistent viral infection 58, 59 , possibly by inhibiting antiviral T cell responses and facilitating pathogen persistence. Other studies have suggested that hepatic NK cells may contribute to innate resistance to HCV infection via increased expression of NKp30 (also known as NCR3) 60 . Finally, liver NK cells might contribute to the therapeutic activities of IFNα against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV infection. In addition to its direct antiviral effects, IFNα treatment might affect NK cell activity 61 . Transcriptional profiling studies using gene arrays identified TRAIL as one of the most significantly upregulated genes in NK cells after IFNα stimulation. IFNα-stimulated NK cells killed HCV-infected hepatoma cells in a TRAILdependent manner. These findings suggest that IFNα-induced TRAIL expression on NK cells may be associated with control of HCV infection 61 .
 Thus, steady-state hepatic NK cells promote liver tolerance and contain a population with memory-like features. Following viral infection, chemokines that are produced by liverresident cells recruit more NK cells to the liver, and these cells acquire an activated phenotype to control viral infection. Crosstalk with liver-resident cells restrains NK cellmediated cytotoxicity following viral clearance to avoid bystander tissue damage. However, during chronic liver infections, NK cells promote the persistence of the pathogen and liver injury while inhibiting liver fibrosis and tissue regeneration.
 Interpretation of studies performed with NK cells in mucosal tissues is complicated by the fact that many studies often have not been able to distinguish bona fide NK cells from NKT cells and the growing population of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that are particularly prevalent in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)
 . Nevertheless, based on the available evidence, NK cells represent a major lymphocyte subset in the healthy lung (accounting for ~10% of all lymphocytes in the lung in mice) 16 , and are also present in healthy skin in humans 62 and in the GALT of humans and mice 65 .
 In humans, infection with Staphylococcus aureus triggers a vigorous NK cell influx into the broncho-alveolar space 64 . Ligation of diverse chemokine receptors, including CCR2, CXCR3 and CX 3 CR1, with their corresponding ligands recruits NK cells to the lung during various pathogen encounters 16 .
 In acute skin lesions, such as psoriatic plaques in human patients, 5-8% of the infiltrating cells are CD3 − CD56 + NK cells, which are mostly localized in the mid and papillary dermis 63 . Skin NK cells express high levels of the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5, intermediate amounts of CXCR1, CCR6, chemokine-like receptor 1 (also known as CHEMR23) and CCR8, and low levels of CCR1, CCR2, CCR4, CCR7 and CX 3 CR1 (REF. 65 ). Moreover, they home to the skin, directed by CXCL10 and CCL5 (REF. 63 ) (TABLE  1) .
 In the intestine, NK cells are found predominantly within the lamina propria and are rare in lymphoid aggregates, although they can be found in the para-follicular region of caecal lymphoid patches, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes 65 .
 NK cells generated in vitro from lung NK cell progenitors differ substantially from NK cells generated from bone marrow-derived NK cell progenitors with regard to expression of members of the LY49 family of NK cell receptors. Specifically, lung NK cells express multiple LY49 receptors, whereas most NK cells that develop from bone marrow-derived progenitors express CD94-NKG2 heterodimers but not LY49, suggesting a major impact of the microenvironment on NK cell development 66 . During S. aureus infection, lung NK cells produce increased amounts of TNF 64 .
 In addition to their distinct patterns of chemokine receptor expression, NK cells in the skin of patients with psoriatic lesions exhibit a CD56 hi CD16 − CD158b − phenotype, fail to express the skin-homing cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen and release abundant IFNγ following stimulation 63 .
 A major challenge in identifying gut NK cells lies in the difficulty in discriminating these cells from other gut ILCs. A subset of gut ILCs expresses NKp46, and among this subset one fraction lacks expression of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) and produces IFNγ 67 . Among gut ILCs, these NKp46 + RORγt − cells resemble conventional NK cells in several respects, such as in the expression of several NK cell receptors and various molecules that are required for NK cell-dependent cytotoxicity 63 , and thus these cells are likely to be bona fide gut NK cells. However, adding to the complexity is the observation that, whereas RORγt expression is stable in 'non-NK' NKp46 + RORγt + cells in the small intestine, RORγt expression can be lost in these cells in the colon, leading to a population of IFNγ-polarized NKp46 + RORγt − cells that are phenotypically indistinguishable from gut NK cells 67 .
 In the lung, alveolar macrophage-derived IL-15 supports NK cell proliferation and, conversely, lung macrophages show improved phagocytosis of S. aureus in the presence of NK cells 64 . Similarly, there appears to be a reciprocal relationship between skin-infiltrating NK cells and keratinocytes. Keratinocytes may provide a major source of CCL5 and CXCL10 to recruit NK cells, and skin-resident NK cells release large amounts of IFNγ and efficiently activate keratinocytes 63 . In the gut, signals emanating from DCs, epithelial cells and luminal contents constantly regulate GALT development and function, thereby contributing to the maintenance of a 'tolerogenic' status to innocuous antigens and commensal flora while initiating immune responses and tissue reparative mechanisms that restrain pathogen invasion 67 . For example, IL-23 enhances the production of IL-22 by NKp46 + RORγt + cells 67, 68 , and this may function to preserve and restore epithelial barrier integrity 67 .
 NK cells, including those in the gut and other mucosal lymphoid organs, are thought to protect against infection by viruses and other intracellular pathogens. For example, within 24 hours of infection with orally administered Listeria mono-cytogenes, IFNγ production is induced by NK cells in the small intestine 69 . IFNγ production peaks at 48 hours postinoculation in this model. Importantly, blocking IFNγ, but not IL-22, with neutralizing antibodies induces significant increases in bacterial loads in the GALT 69 . However, this does not exclude an important role for IL-22 in other bacterial infections or in other forms of tissue injury 69, 70 .
 In summary, NK cells are detected in healthy mucosal tissues and the skin. In response to infection, more NK cells are recruited to the lung, the gut and the skin, and these cells acquire an activated phenotype, which is essential for pathogen clearance. Moreover, in the gut, classical NK cells together with ILCs appear to control inflammatory responses.
 NK cell homing to the uterus NK cells are abundant in the decidua -the endometrium of the pregnant uterus that forms the maternal part of the placenta. There, uterine NK cells are thought to control endo-metrial tissue remodelling, vascular function and the formation of a placenta in the uterus 71, 72 . Several studies have described the kinetics of uterine NK cell accumulation in pregnant mice 72, 73 . Following fertilization and implantation, NK cells accumulate initially in the decidua basalis, which is subjacent to the trophoblast layer, and later in the mesometrial lymphoid aggregate of pregnancy, a lymphoid structure that transiently forms between the two layers of myometrial smooth muscle. Uterine NK cell numbers peak at mid-gestation (9-10 days) and decline in the last 5 days of pregnancy 73 . Uterine NK cells can either develop in situ or migrate from the peripheral blood through a CXCR4-and CXCL12dependent mechanism (reviewed in REF. 74 ) (TABLE 1) .
 During pregnancy, the human uterine decidua is dominated by the presence of CD56 hi CD16 − NK cells 75 . In the mouse, two distinct subsets of CD3 − CD122 + NK cells have been described in the uterus at mid-gestation 76 (TABLE 2) . The smaller subset expresses phenotypic markers of peripheral NK cells and might therefore represent peripheral NK cells that have recently been recruited into the uterus. The larger subset lacks NK1.1 expression and reacts with Dolichus biflorus agglutinin, which specifically identifies uterine NK cells in the mouse. Uterine NK cells express a unique repertoire of MHC class Ibinding receptors, activation markers and adhesion molecules. The unique LY49 receptor repertoire of mouse uterine NK cells suggests that they develop within the uterus and that the local microenvironment may shape the LY49 receptor repertoire 76 . Similarly, NK cells in the human uterine mucosa have recently been characterized and found to resemble unique early developmental stages of human NK cell differentiation 77 .
 The function of uterine NK cells is still not clear, but it appears that they interact with invading trophoblasts, and this interaction results in the release of factors that modify the uterine spiral arteries. This 'physiological' inflammatory process is important as it increases the blood supply to the mouse fetus 71, 78, 79 . Moreover, uterine NK cell-derived IFNγ is needed for vascular modifications to occur during pregnancy 78 . Although mice lacking uterine NK cells or components of the IFNγ pathway do not exhibit increased fetal loss, they show several abnormalities during pregnancy, including reduced decidual cellularity and inadequate modifications of the spiral arteries 73 .
 In addition, the regulation of NK cell activation is crucial for normal placentation and hence a successful pregnancy. Interestingly, human immunogenetic studies have suggested that interactions between fetal HLA-C molecules and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) on uterine NK cells are important for reproductive success in humans, possibly through tuning the threshold for NK cell activation 80 .
 Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) produced by decidual stromal cells can reduce CD16 expression on NK cells, thereby impairing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) 81 . CXCL12 is produced in the decidua, particularly by extravillous trophoblasts, and attracts peripheral NK cells towards the decidua 82 ; on the other hand, the presence of IL-15 and stem cell factors may support NK cell development in situ 74 (TABLE 1) .
 Uterine NK cell activation following interaction with invading trophoblasts has been associated with several pregnancy disorders. A seminal study described how a particular combination of fetal HLA-C molecules and maternal inhibitory NK cell receptors was associated with a predisposition for pre-eclampsia 83 . More recently, such studies have been extended to recurrent miscarriage and fetal growth restriction, revealing a common uterine NK cell-mediated mechanism underlying these pregnancy disorders 84 . Importantly, this study also showed that mothers with uterine NK cells that express activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors with similar specificities are less likely to suffer from unsuccessful pregnancy. Although data from human population genetics studies have provided interesting insights into the factors controlling interactions between uterine NK cells and trophoblasts of fetal origin, functional studies in humans are challenging. Thus, despite differences in placentation between humans and mice 71 , mice may provide an important model for studying the biology of uterine NK cells.
 In summary, uterine NK cells can either develop in situ or migrate to the decidua after being attracted by locally produced chemokines. Their receptor repertoire suggests that their activation has to be tightly regulated to ensure normal pregnancy. Moreover, mouse and human studies suggest that crosstalk between uterine NK cells and trophoblasts contributes to vascular modifications during pregnancy.
 NK cell homing to the pancreas NK cells are present not only in the pancreas of diabetes-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice but also in the pancreas of mouse strains that are not susceptible to the development of diabetes 85 . This indicates that NK cells can be recruited to the pancreas in the absence of profound inflammation. Nevertheless, the severity of T1D in NOD mice correlates with increased numbers and early entry of NK cells into the pancreas 5,6,85 , suggesting a diseasepromoting role for these infiltrating NK cells. Importantly, one study showed that NK cells accumulate before T cells in the islet infiltrates 85 . NK cells might be recruited to the pancreas by chemokines such as CXCL10 (a ligand for CXCR3 on NK cells) and CCL5 (a ligand for CCR5 on NK cells), which can be produced by multiple cell types, including pancreatic β-cells (TABLE 1) , and their numbers are increased in the pancreas of NOD mice in an accelerated model of T1D 86 .
 Molecular, phenotypic and functional characteristics of NK cells in the pancreas and spleen have been compared between diabetes-prone NOD mice and diabetes-resistant mice 5, 85 . Microarray studies revealed that the NK cell gene complex, which encodes a set of NK cell receptor genes, is expressed differently in diabetes-prone NOD mice versus diabetesresistant B6.H-2 g7 mice (which are congenic for the NOD MHC region). Immune phenotyping analyses further indicated that pancreatic NK cells from NOD mice share phenotypic characteristics with pancreatic NK cells from non-diabetic strains, but display increased levels of the activation markers CD69 and CD25, and of surface killer cell lectinlike receptor G1 (KLRG1), which is a marker for mature NK cells that have undergone proliferation 85 . Furthermore, a subset of pancreatic NK cells from young NOD mice produced IFNγ and expressed the lysosomal marker lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1; also known as CD107a) 85 , which is a marker for NK cell degranulation (TABLE 2) .
 However, proliferating and activated NK cells were detected only in the early pre-diabetic infiltrates 85 . During the later stages of diabetes development, most pancreatic NK cells of NOD animals became hyporesponsive, as reflected by diminished cytokine secretion and a lower capacity to degranulate in response to antibodies specific for activating receptors, and in response to activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. It was thus proposed that pancreatic NK cells from NOD mice initially mediate pro-inflammatory effector functions, but later become hyporesponsive owing to exhaustion or regulation 85 .
 Experiments in which splenic NK cells from NOD mice were transferred into recombination activating gene (RAG)-and common cytokine receptor γ-chain (γ c )-deficient NOD mice (which lack B cells, T cells and NK cells) showed that NK cells migrate to the pancreas and upregulate CD69 and KLRG1 expression 85 . This suggests that the local micro-environment in the pancreas of NOD mice, in the absence of profound inflammation and adaptive immune cells, can recruit NK cells and regulate the phenotype of these cells. In addition, one study suggested that the NK cell activating receptor NKp46 can recognize ligands on βcells that promote NK cell activation, which, in turn, might result in β-cell destruction 8 . Such activated NK cells might exhibit direct cytotoxicity against pancreatic β-cells and recruit other cell types, and thus have a pathogenic role during the early stages of diabetes development.
 The hyporesponsive phenotype of NK cells that is observed during later stages of diabetes development might be partly caused by interactions between NK cell receptors and their ligands expressed by pancreatic β-cells. For example, it has been suggested that ligands for NKG2D -such as retinoic acid early inducible 1 (RAE1; also known as mRNA export factor) expressed by pancreatic β-cells -might downregulate the expression of NKG2D and 'turn off' NK cells to avoid excessive autoimmunity 87 . Furthermore, interaction of the inhibitory receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) on pancreatic NK cells with PD1 ligands on inflamed islets might dampen the response of pancreatic NK cells 85, 88 .
 The phenotype of NK cells in the pancreas might be influenced by cytokines produced by other cell types. For example, it has been suggested that cytokines derived from autoreactive T cells might contribute to the hypo-responsive phenotype of NK cells during the later stages of diabetes development in NOD mice 87 . There is also evidence that NK cell functions are kept in check by T Reg cells, as ablation of CD4 + FOXP3 + T Reg cells in diabetes-prone BDC2.5 T cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic NOD mice results in rapid activation of NK cells within the insulitic lesions, before the activation of effector T cells 6 .
 A pathogenic role of NK cells in T1D has been supported by evidence derived from several animal models [5] [6] [7] [8] 86, 89 . Depletion of NK cells significantly inhibited diabetes development in three mouse models: BDC2.5 TCR-transgenic NOD mice treated with cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4)-specific antibodies 5 ; transgenic NOD mice with pancreatic expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1) that had been infected with coxsackievirus B4 (REF. 89); and transgenic NOD mice with β-cell-specific expression of IFNβ 86 . Furthermore, blockade of the NK cell activating receptor NKG2D prevented disease in NOD mice 7 , although the contribution of other NKG2D-expressing cells (including CD8 + T cells) could not be ruled out in this model.
 In addition to their pathogenic roles in autoimmune diabetes, NK cells can, paradoxically, exhibit protective functions in β-cell autoimmunity. NK cells have a crucial role in mediating the capacity of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) to protect NOD mice from diabetes 90 . NK cells also have an important role in islet allograft tolerance in C57BL/6 mice induced by blocking interactions between CD40 and CD154 or between lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1; also known as αLβ2 integrin) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) 91 . It is likely, however, that these ameliorating effects of NK cells on autoimmunity and allograft rejection are mediated by peripheral rather than pancreatic NK cells, possibly through them interacting directly with DCs or pathogenic T cells.
 In summary, few NK cells home to the healthy pancreas, and the numbers of pancreatic NK cells are substantially increased in diabetes-prone and diabetic mice. The local microenvironment of the pre-diabetic pancreas seems to induce NK cell proliferation and activation. At later disease stages, crosstalk between pancreatic NK cells and β-cells or other immune cells leads to NK cell hypo-responsiveness. Despite their early pathogenic role in diabetes, NK cells have also been implicated in CFA-mediated diabetes protection and in islet allograft tolerance.
 Whereas few NK cells are present in healthy joints, these cells are abundant in the inflamed joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis 92 and in mice with collagen-induced arthritis 13 . NK cells can be detected in the inflamed synovial tissue at any stage of the disease, and they constitute up to 20% of all lymphocytes in synovial fluid of patients with established rheumatoid arthritis 92 . These cells express increased levels of the chemokine receptor CCR5 and, to a lesser extent, CCR2 (REF. 93 ). Chemokine ligands for these receptors have been detected in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis 94 (TABLE 1) .
 Among synovial fluid NK cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, cells of the CD56 hi CD16 − phenotype predominate 92, 95, 96 , suggesting that this cell population is selectively recruited to the inflamed synovium and/or expands there. These cells also express high levels of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, produce granzymes and exhibit enhanced cytotoxicity compared with systemic NK cells 87, 92 (TABLE 2) . Uniquely, NK cells in the joints of mice with collagen-induced arthritis express receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) 97, 98 , a feature that is shared with NK cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis 99 .
 The molecular features of synovial fluid NK cells and their interaction with other cells in the inflamed joint have been investigated in animal models. NK cells in the inflamed joint that express RANKL and M-CSF are frequently juxtaposed with monocytes in the synovium of inflamed joints 13 (TABLE 2) . The reciprocal interactions between these two cell types can trigger the formation of osteoclasts in a process that is dependent on RANKL and M-CSF 13 .
 Cytokines, such as IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18, that are produced by myeloid cells in the inflamed joint can stimulate IFNγ production by NK cells 95 . These factors, in particular IL-15, might also contribute to the induction of RANKL and M-CSF in synovial NK cells 13 .
 Depletion of NK cells from mice before the induction of collagen-induced arthritis reduces the severity of subsequent arthritis and almost completely prevents bone erosion 13 . Paradoxically, however, NK cells were shown to have a crucial role in protection against inflammatory arthritis mediated by unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotides following transfer of serum from K/BxN mice into wild-type mice 14 . This protection required interaction of NK cells with DCs in lymphoid organs, resulting in reduced neutrophil recruitment to the joints. These observations suggest opposite functions of NK cells in lymph nodes versus inflamed joints during rheumatoid arthritis. The current available information is not sufficient to provide a clear linkage between the divergent phenotypes and functions of NK cells in lymphoid organs and joints. Differences in the triggering antigens (that is, type II collagen versus glucose-6-phosphate isomerase) in different models of arthritis and their roles in inducing NK cells directly or indirectly invite further investigation.
 Thus, NK cells are recruited to the inflamed joints, where they exhibit an activated phenotype and promote osteoclast differentiation and inflammation. By contrast, lymph node NK cells have been suggested to play a crucial part in CpG-induced protection against inflammatory arthritis in a mouse disease model.
 In the CNS, the brain and spinal cord are shielded from the circulating blood by the bloodbrain barrier and the epithelial blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, respectively, which are formed by the tight junctions of endothelial cells and prevent the influx of immune cells under normal physiological conditions. This view was recently challenged by the finding that activated T cells can breach the blood-brain barrier and the epithelial bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier to perform immune surveillance functions in the CNS 100 . It is conceivable that peripherally activated lymphocytes, including NK cells, might also be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. However, data on the presence of NK cells in the human brain and spinal cord are sparse. Nevertheless, NK cells can be detected in mouse CNS tissues during a variety of infections, including infection by murine corona virus 101 , Semliki Forest virus 102 and L. monocytogenes 103 . NK cells are also recruited to the CNS in glioma-bearing mice; 1 week after tumour implantation, NK cells constitute approximately 50% of all leukocytes in the CNS, and after this peak their frequency gradually declines 104 . NK cells might be recruited to the CNS by chemokines such as CX 3 CL1 produced by neurons and CCL2 and CXCL10 produced by microglia, astrocytes or infiltrating inflammatory cells (TABLE 1) .
 The most intriguing data on the role for NK cells in CNS inflammation are derived from studies of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this model, NK cells become fully activated and proliferate in the CNS even before the arrival of T cells 105 . Analysis of NK cells in the CNS of mice with EAE suggested that, compared with their peripheral counterparts, CNS-infiltrating NK cells upregulate the inhibitory receptor NKG2A and produce large amounts of CCL2, a chemoattractant for microglia 11, 12 .
 The CNS is distinguished from other organs with regard to the genesis and progression of inflammatory responses in that it harbours a unique spectrum of antigen-presenting cells (APCs; that is, astrocytes and microglia) and neuroantigens, and accommodates intimate interactions between the immune and nervous systems (FIG. 2) . So, after homing to the inflamed CNS, NK cells become receptive to an array of cellular components that they have not encountered in the periphery. These include astrocytes, microglia and neurons [106] [107] [108] [109] , which release numerous soluble factors with diversified and perhaps coordinated effects on NK cells (FIG. 2) .
 The finding that NK cells in the CNS control the magnitude of an inflammatory response in the EAE model 11, 12 suggests that, after homing to the CNS, NK cells exert specific functions that affect the outcome of inflammation. In particular, it has been suggested that NK cells in the CNS can directly lyse microglia 11, 12 . Microglia are macrophage-like APCs that are capable of priming myelin-reactive T cells, and they exert direct effects on neuronal or glial cells depending on the timing of the inflammatory process and the activation status of these cells [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] . Microglia serve as sentinels for ongoing immune responses in the periphery that have the potential to spread to the CNS. In comparison with the behaviour of other types of APC in the CNS during brain inflammation, activated microglia appear to become targets of peripherally activated NK cells that enter the CNS 11 . Such interactions between NK cells and microglia are likely to be facilitated by the recruitment of microglia through CCL2 secretion by NK cells. As activated microglia have a crucial role in initiating and propagating pathogenic T cell responses during EAE, their elimination results in reduced numbers of myelin-reactive T helper 17 (T H 17) cells in the CNS 11 . Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, susceptibility of activated microglia to NK cell lysis may occur through the loss of MHC class I expression on these cells 11, 12 (FIG. 2) . These findings in mice are in apparent contrast with a recent study suggesting that human NK cells can lyse resting microglia but spare activated microglia in an in vitro culture system 105 . However, it remains unclear which NK cell subset executed this killing activity and how microglia were maintained within a resting state during this experiment.
 Under pathophysiological conditions, an array of soluble factors is produced by microglia, astrocytes and neuronal cells (FIG. 2) . Based on their effect on NK cells, these mediators can be categorized as inhibitory (such as TGFβ, IL-10 and acetylcholine) or stimulatory (such as ATP, UTP, glutamate, prostaglandin E2, H 2 O 2 , nitric oxide, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF, epidermal growth factor (EGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3, neurotrophin 4, IL-3, IL-12 and M-CSF). So, the sequence of soluble signals received by NK cells, the physical location of the cellular source of these factors and the balance between inhibitory and stimulatory signals that NK cells receive may all influence the functional status of NK cells in the inflamed CNS.
 During EAE in C57BL/6 mice, depletion of NK cells exacerbates neurological deficits 9, 11 . Similarly, CX 3 CR1-deficient mice, in which homing of NK cells to the brain is severely impaired, develop fatal inflammatory lesions following EAE induction 10 . As the numbers of peripheral NK cells in these mice are comparable with those of wild-type mice, these results imply that a CNS-specific deficit in NK cells leads to aggressive inflammation and autoimmunity in the CNS (FIG. 2) . Thus, there is strong evidence that CNS-specific NK cells control CNS inflammation during EAE in mice.
 These findings might be relevant to the mode of action of daclizumab, a humanized antibody specific for the IL-2 receptor α-chain (CD25). Daclizumab, alone or in combination with IFN preparations, consistently reduces CNS lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis [112] [113] [114] [115] . One of the immunological effects of daclizumab is that it can expand CD56 hi NK cell populations in treated patients 107 . In a human-mouse chimaera model, it has been demonstrated that EAE can be ameliorated by transfusion of human NK cells 11 . As administration of NK cells directly into the brain appeared to achieve enhanced clinical benefits compared with systemically administered cells 11 , these results suggest that NK cells within the brain may have an anti-inflammatory role. Furthermore, there is some evidence to suggest that other drugs that are currently used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, such as IFN preparations and glatiramer acetate (a random polymer of the four amino acids found in myelin basic protein; also known as copolymer 1 or Copaxone (Teva Pharmaceuticals)), may achieve their clinical efficacy partially by inducing NK cells 116, 117 via a mechanism similar to that of daclizumab.
 In addition to their protective role in autoimmune disease, NK cells control CNS infections. In detail, NK cells provide protection against encephalitis and demyelination induced by Theiler's murine encephalitis virus 118 , reduce viral replication and disease following intracerebral infection by murine coronavirus 101 , and exacerbate immunopathology and accelerate mortality during Semliki Forest virus infection 102 .
 In summary, there are no data on the presence of NK cells in the steady-state CNS, but NK cells have been shown to migrate to the inflamed CNS. Although the exact cellular and molecular interactions that shape NK cell phenotype and function in the CNS still need to be determined, it appears that activated NK cells have a protective role in the brain under the circumstances of ongoing inflammation, as they eliminate viral infection and inhibit the activation of autoimmune T cells through the killing of activated microglia.
 The major functions of NK cells in the liver, mucosal tissues, skin, pancreas and perhaps the CNS are to amplify the local immune response and combat infectious agents. In doing so, NK cells may kill infected or transformed cells. When this process becomes dysregulated, damage to neighbouring cells and autoimmune disease might ensue. Determinants for these divergent roles of NK cells, as exemplified here for a number of different organs, include the timing of immune responses, the different pathogens targeted by the NK cells and the NK cell-orchestrated immune responses. Furthermore, the studies discussed here raise the possibility that organ-specific factors shape NK cell phenotype and contribute to the organspecific functions of these cells. The organ-specific features of NK cells appear to be dictated by a number of factors that are intrinsic to a particular organ, including its anatomical structure, accessibility to peripheral immune cells, and the unique micro-environment of cells and soluble factors within the organ. Additional determinants include inciting pathogens or autoantigens that induce inflammation.
 We have discussed here the organ-specific features of NK cells and given examples of how these cells may serve to maintain normal health and contribute to the development and control of inflammation in various organ-specific diseases. There are many outstanding questions and future challenges in this area (BOX 2) . Progress will be facilitated by novel approaches such as two-photon microscopy, which has been used to record the trafficking of several types of lymphocytes to reveal the cellular interactions within solid organs in physiological and pathological situations [119] [120] [121] [122] . The application of this and other techniques to studies of NK cells in solid organs should reveal valuable information on the physical localization of NK cells within specific anatomical structures, as well as interactions with resident cellular components. Imaging studies in live animals may yield insight into the behaviour of NK cells during the course of organ-specific inflammation.
 Outstanding questions on the organ-specific features of NK cells
 • What determines natural killer (NK) cell recruitment to different organs, and how does the phenotype of NK cells change following recruitment to specific organs under different experimental conditions?
 • Under what conditions do local NK cells become activated in different organs?
 • Are specific features of NK cells within individual organs the cause or the consequence of inflammatory responses within that organ?
 • How is the phenotype of NK cells linked to their particular functions within the inflamed organs?
 • How can organ-intrinsic factors that boost or silence certain NK cell functions be harnessed to control infection or reduce inflammation?
 • Do inflamed organs retain the recruited NK cells in an activated state, or do they allow for NK cell circulation back to other tissues and/or restoration of a resting NK cell phenotype?
 • How are the local effects of NK cells affected by tissue-specific MHC class I expression? In addition to altering effector responses, how do the different levels of tissue MHC class I expression affect the functionality of local NK cells through education or licensing processes? How are these processes affected by local inflammatory responses and the influx of additional inflammatory cells that may alter tissue MHC class I expression levels?
 High-throughput DNA and protein arrays, aided by laser capture microscopy to sample highly purified NK cells from localized areas of pathology, may aid in defining molecular signatures of NK cells within the inflamed organs. Improved access to human organs will also be paramount. Furthermore, improved 'humanized' mouse models that are capable of maintaining transplanted, functional human immune cells, including NK cells, should aid our understanding of human NK cells in mouse organs. Many mouse cytokine, chemokine and cellular (for example, Notch-induced) signalling pathways can trigger the expression of human NK cell receptors 123 . Improving our understanding of organ-specific NK cell functions through the use of these techniques will allow us to take advantage of organ-intrinsic factors for boosting specific NK cell functions to control infection or tumours, or to silence excessive effector functions to protect against organ-specific autoimmunity.
 During evolution, distinct organs might have evolved different ways to recruit and influence the effector functions of NK cells. Once we understand these mechanisms, the next challenge will be to exploit this information to harness NK cells for combating infectious agents and tumours and for avoiding autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
 Natural killer cells (NK cells). Cytotoxic lymphocytes of the innate immune system. These cells have an important role in host defence against many intracellular pathogens and some tumours, regulate the development of adaptive immunity, and control the homeostasis of other immune cells. Human NK cells express the surface marker CD56, and mouse NK cells express the surface markers DX5 (CD49b) and, in some mouse strains (for example, C57BL/ 6), NK1.1 (CD161)
 A form of diabetes caused by autoimmune destruction of insulinproducing pancreatic β-cells. Autoimmune destruction is predominantly mediated by CD8 + T cells, but natural killer cells may affect disease outcome
 A systemic inflammatory disorder that may affect many tissues and organs, but principally attacks synovial joints. The disease process produces an inflammatory response of the synovium (synovitis), secondary to hyperplasia of synovial cells, excess synovial fluid and the development of pannus in the synovium. The pathology of the disease process often leads to the destruction of articular cartilage and ankylosis of the joints Hepatic NK cells face the challenging task of balancing immunity to multiple hepatotropic viruses and bacteria with tolerance to food and self antigens. In the steady state, commensal-derived lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that arrive in the liver from the gut through the portal vein ligate Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4, respectively, on Kupffer cells, triggering the release of interleukin-10 (IL-10) 126 . IL-10 in turn renders NK cells hyporesponsive to IL-12 and IL-18 and promotes tolerance in the liver. In addition, expression of the inhibitory receptor natural killer group 2, member A (NKG2A) is increased, whereas expression of the activating receptor LY49 is decreased on NK cells. c | During viral infection, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ligates TLR3 and triggers Kupffer cells to release IL-6 and IL-18, which in turn activate NK cells and boost their killing activity. This is reflected by the phenotype of hepatic NK cells, which is characterized by the expression of high levels of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), perforin and granzymes, and a lack of LY49. Activated hepatic NK cells can lyse hepatocytes or stellate cells via TRAIL-dependent pathways during hepatitis B virus infection or fibrosis, respectively. Thus, Kupffer cells appear to have a dual role in shaping hepatic NK cell phenotype and function. Hepatic NK cells are also subjected to the influence of interferon-γ (IFNγ) released by natural killer T (NKT) cells. Hepatic NK cells can acquire memory to antigens derived from influenza virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and HIV-1 (not shown). CCR, CC-chemokine receptor; CXCR, CXC-chemokine receptor; S1PR, S1P receptor.
 The entry of lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS) is normally shielded by the blood-brain barrier, which becomes compromised in several pathological circumstances. Natural killer (NK) cells are recruited to the inflamed brain by CX 3 C-chemokine ligand 1 (CX 3 CL1) produced by neurons. Brain-specific cell types and neurotransmitters alter the features of NK cells that migrate from the periphery. An array of cytokines, growth factors and neurotransmitters produced by microglial cells, astrocytes and neurons can influence NK cell activation and proliferation. The chemokine CC-chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) attracts NK cells to the site of inflammatory foci. After acquiring new features, brainresident NK cells lose tolerance to microglial cells, suppress pathogenic, myelin-reactive T helper cells and significantly attenuate the intensity of local inflammatory and autoimmune responses. NK cells also kill neurons infected by herpes simplex virus. In addition, mediators derived from neurons, microglial cells and astrocytes and multidirectional cellular interactions may influence NK cell tolerance and function. The combined effects of soluble factors and cellular interactions, as well as the timing of the immune response, may dictate NK cell activity in the CNS.

Thus, intraepithelial ILC1 may facilitate immune responses during exposure to infections but contribute to IBD when dysregulated. NKp44 + CD103 À cells produced IL-22 ( Figure 1A ) and many expressed CCR6, IL-1R, and IL-7Ra ( Figure 1B ) and therefore corresponded to ILC3. IL-23, which stimulates ILC3, was ineffective (data not shown). Interestingly, the magnitude of IFN-g production by NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 À CD103 À cells was similar to that of peripheral blood CD56 hi NK cells ( Figure 1D ), which are known producers of IFN-g in response to cytokines (Cooper et al., Both NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 À CD103 À ILC1 expressed more CD107a than ILC3 ( Figure 1F ). 1994) and is a marker of intraepithelial T lymphocytes (Cheroutre et al., Cells were gated on the NKp44 + and the NKp44 À fractions. ( Shown are combined results obtained from seven individual donors. Type 1 Innate Lymphoid Cells in the Gut (Shui et al., 2012) (Figure 2A ), as well as CD101 (also known as EWI-101) (Allez et al., Thus, we hypothesized that NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 are intraepithelial. We investigated serial sections of human tonsils for NKp44 and CD103 expression by immunohistochemistry. We found that numerous NKp44 + cells localized in the epithelia overlaying the crypts and the surface of the tonsil, Figure S2 (A-D) CD56 + cells enriched from tonsils were analyzed for surface markers gating on live CD3 À CD19 À cells. Red lines indicate NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1, blue lines denote ILC3 (NKp44 + CD103 À ), and black lines indicate NKp44 À CD103 À cells. Representative data from experiments with three or more individual tonsil samples are shown. ( Displayed are normalized data from qRT-PCR experiments with three (NEDD9) and five (ITGAE) individual donors. F) NKp44 + CD103 + cells were sorted from tonsils, cultured in IL-15 with or without the addition of TGF-b for 9 days, and analyzed for CD103 and NKp44 expression. ( G) Tonsil CD56 + cells were analyzed for surface expression of activation markers as in (A)-(D). Fewer NKp44 + cells were found in the interfollicular areas, and none in the follicles ( Figure S2 ; data not shown). Conversely, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed low amounts of CD11b (alpha M integrin) and CD11c (alpha X integrin). Unexpectedly, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 did not express CCR9, which has been shown to be a major chemokine receptor that drives lymphocytes into the epithelium ( Figure 2C ). 2007) and the integrin-signaling molecule NEDD9 (Giampieri et al., 2012) , was not observed on any subset ( Figure S2 ). 1999 ) but heretofore has not been implicated in ILC development or function. We then added CD56 + cells isolated from human tonsils to the cultures and analyzed the IFN-g content in ILC1 by flow cytometry. In contrast, ILC3 were mainly found in the lamina propria. NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 from the small intestine expressed most prototypic markers noted on their tonsilar counterparts, including NKp44, NKp46, CD39 ( Figure 5A) , CD101, CD49a, and CD160 (data not shown). Immunohistochemical analysis of NKp44, CD103, and CD3 in the appendix and intestinal villi showed that although the majority of NKp44 + cells are found in the lamina propria, some cells are located within the epithelium ( Figure 5C ; data not shown). CD103 + ILC1 among numerous intraepithelial T cells. In contrast, CD160 was an optimal marker of intraepithelial ILC1 because we detected a distinct population of CD160 + NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells within the IEL of Rag1 À/À mice ( Figure 6A ). Spleen NK cells did not express CD160 in steady state, corroborating the specificity of this marker for intraepithelial ILC1 ( Figure S4 ). The identification of the phenotype of murine intraepithelial ILC1 gave us the opportunity to investigate the transcription factors required for their development. Analysis of IEL isolated from the small intestine 36 hr after injection of anti-CD40 revealed a robust production of IFN-g by CD160 + NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells ( Figure 7A ), corroborating their early proinflammatory function in this model. This observation was consistent with our previous demonstration that human ILC3 are functionally plastic. Our study extends the diversity of human ILC within the oral and gastrointestinal mucosa, characterizing a subset of human IFN-g-producing ILC, designated intraepithelial ILC1. Although related to NK cells, intraepithelial ILC1 were unique in that they were located in the mucosal epithelium, shared multiple phenotypic and functional features with CD8 T rm , and had several hallmarks of TGF-b imprinting. ILC produce signature cytokines in response to cytokine stimulation . Control staining of NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells is indicated by a dotted line. Cells were gated on CD45 + NK1.1 + cells. Cells were gated on CD45 + CD3 À NKp46 + cells. Cells were gated on CD45 + CD3 À CD19 À . ( E) Small intestinal IEL of conventionally housed (SPF) or germ-free C57BL/6 mice, as well as of adult and neonate C57BL/6 mice, were analyzed for the presence of NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells. The gray profile indicates CD160 on wild-type splenic NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells. Interestingly, intraepithelial ILC1 shared multiple phenotypic and functional features with CD8 Trm, which persist in the gastrointestinal tract, lung mucosae, and skin long after a primary infection has cleared and are very effective at preventing reinfection (Cauley and Lefranç ois, 2013) . Given this, we envision that intraepithelial ILC1 are the innate counterparts of nonmigratory CD8 T rm . TGF-b imprinting was previously observed in decidual NK cells, which are in close contact with the fetal trophoblast and presumably contribute to maternalfetal tolerance (Koopman et al., B) shows the weight of mice recorded as the percentage of initial weight. This observation enabled us to examine the developmental pathway of intraepithelial ILC1 in mice with targeted mutations of master transcription factors, demonstrating the requirement of Nfil3 and Tbx21, factors involved in the development of conventional NK cells. Although it was previously shown that IL-12 and IL-23 play a major role in the wasting syndrome and colon inflammation, respectively (Buonocore et al., Stained cells were analyzed on a FACS Calibur or FACS Canto using CellQuest and Diva programs, respectively. Rorc À/À and Rag-1 À/À mice were obtained from Jackson laboratories. Mice were used between 6 and 8 weeks of age, with the exception of those used to study neonate IEL from the small intestine, which were 10 days old. Tonsils, intestinal samples, and peripheral blood products were obtained under the approval of the WUSM institutional review board.

Rag-1 À/À mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) Mice were weighed daily and sacrificed at day 7 after anti-CD40 injection to analyze intestinal pathology as previously described (Uhlig et al., To evaluate IFN-g production by IEL, mice were sacrificed 36 hr after anti-CD40 injection."
54,54,866ee0d70efc9713979aa032d14d22dfe7575f7a,,The immune response during acute HIV-1 infection: clues for vaccine development,"The early immune response to HIV-1 infection is likely to be an important factor in determining the clinical course of disease. Recent data indicate that the HIV-1 quasispecies that arise following a mucosal infection are usually derived from a single transmitted virus. Moreover, the finding that the first effective immune responses drive the selection of virus escape mutations provides insight into the earliest immune responses against the transmitted virus and their contributions to the control of acute viraemia. Strong innate and adaptive immune responses occur subsequently but they are too late to eliminate the infection. In this Review, we discuss recent studies on the kinetics and quality of early immune responses to HIV-1 and their implications for developing a successful preventive HIV-1 vaccine.
 Recent advances that enable the identification of patients within the first few weeks of HIV-1 infection 1,2 have provided researchers access to samples from acutely infected patients earlier and in higher numbers than previously available. This has advanced our understanding of the nature of the transmitted virus and the first immune responses in the period before establishment of stable viraemia (the viral set point), which occurs 3-6 months after infection. The first weeks following HIV-1 transmission are extremely dynamic: they are associated with rapid damage to generative immune cell microenvironments, caused by direct viral cytopathicity and bystander effects, and with immune responses that partially control the virus.
 In this Review, we focus our discussion on the early host or viral factors that are crucial for determining the outcome of HIV-1 infection. These include the nature of the transmitted virus, or founder virus, suppression of the initial infection by genetically influenced","immune responses, and the rate of virus mutation and viral fitness of selected mutants. In addition, we review what is known about the nature of innate and adaptive immune responses during this early phase of infection, drawn from studies of humans and macaques infected with HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), respectively. Finally, we discuss how our knowledge of the events of early HIV-1 infection can improve the design of a preventive vaccine (BOX 1).
 Most HIV-1 infections occur by sexual exposure through the genital tract or rectal mucosa. Although it is not possible to study the very first events following HIV-1 transmission in humans in vivo, we have gained some understanding from studies in which mucosal tissue explants were infected in vitro [3] [4] [5] . Further understanding of the first stages of infection in vivo has been obtained from studies in which macaques were inoculated intrarectally or intravaginally with SIV 6, 7 . It is still uncertain whether HIV-1 is transmitted as a free or a cell-bound virus, but SIV can be transmitted in either form 8 . In addition, the mechanism by which HIV-1 crosses the genital mucosal epithelium is unclear. Diffusion of HIV-1 across the vaginal mucosa is slowed by cervicovaginal mucus 9 . It is possible that virus that reaches the mucosal epithelium crosses this barrier by transcytosis or by making direct contact with dendrites of intraepithelial dendritic cells (DCs). Preliminary unpublished findings suggest that virions may also move through intercellular spaces in the epithelium to make initial cell contact with underlying mucosal Langerhans cells and CD4 + T cells (T. Hope and S. McCoombe, personal communication). Given that multiple sexual exposures are usually needed for infection to occur, crossing of the epithelial cell barrier by the virus is probably a rare event, although it is more common if the genital mucosa is damaged by physical trauma or co-existing genital infections 10, 11 .
 Following transmission of the virus, there is a period of ~10 days, known as the eclipse phase, before viral RNA becomes detectable in the plasma (FIG. 1) . Single-genome amplification and sequencing of the first detectable virus has shown that ~80% of mucosally transmitted HIV-1 clade B and C infections are initiated by a single virus [12] [13] [14] . Infectious molecular clones derived from these primary founder viruses could infect CD4 + T cells with greater efficiency than they could infect monocytes and macrophages 14 , which differs from the virus quasispecies that arise later in the infection and can infect lymphoid and myeloid cell types with equal efficiency. Studies in rhesus macaques inoculated intra-rectally with a complex SIV quasispecies also showed that productive infection arises from a single infecting virus 15 , which supports the use of SIV infection of rhesus macaques as a model for HIV-1 transmission and vaccine studies. In other studies 7, 16 in which macaques were infected experimentally, the first cells to be infected in the vaginal mucosa were found in foci of resident memory T cells that expressed the virus receptors CD4 and CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), which is consistent with the cell tropism of cloned HIV-1 founder virus 14 .
 Homogeneity of the founder virus indicates that the established infection probably arises from a single focus of infected mucosal CD4 + T cells. Virus replication at this focus might in fact be supported by early innate immune responses that lead to the recruitment of additional susceptible T cells to the site 16 . The failure of most infected foci to become established may be explained by the high error rate in reverse transcription that occurs during HIV-1 replication and the effects of the host antiviral apolipoprotein B mRNAediting enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) cytidine deaminases APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F, which cause many viruses produced in infected CD4 + T cells to be defective 17
 At the end of the eclipse phase, virus and/or virus-infected cells reach the draining lymph node, where they meet activated CD4 + CCR5 + T cells, which are targets for further infection. This process is augmented by DCs that bind and internalize virus through DC-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN; also known as CD209) and carry the virus to activated T cells 18 . B cells may also be involved in the early spread of infection by binding the virus through the complement receptor CD21 (also known as CR2) 19 . The virus then replicates rapidly and spreads throughout the body to other lymphoid tissues, particularly gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), where activated CD4 + CCR5 + memory T cells are present in high numbers [20] [21] [22] . Approximately 20% of CD4 + T cells in the GALT are infected in both humans with acute HIV-1 infection and SIV-infected macaques. Up to 60% of uninfected CD4 + T cells at this site become activated and die by apoptosis, resulting in the release of apoptotic microparticles that can suppress immune function 23 . Therefore, 80% of CD4 + T cells in the GALT can be depleted in the first 3 weeks of HIV-1 infection 20, 24, 25 . while HIV-1 is replicating in the GALT and other lymphoid tissues, the plasma viraemia increases exponentially to reach a peak, usually more than a million RNA copies per ml of blood, at 14-21 days after SIV infection in macaques and at 21-28 days after HIV-1 infection in humans (FIG. 1) . CD4 + T cell numbers are low at the time of peak viraemia but later return to near normal levels in the blood but not in the GALT 20, 24, 25 . Although B cells are not depleted during early HIV-1 infection, B cell responses are impaired owing to the destruction of other cell types that are important for the development of germinal centres. Up to 50% of germinal centres in the gut are lost within the first 80 days of infection 26 .
 At the point of peak viraemia the immune response has not affected the amino acid sequence of the virus, despite the extensive activation of innate immune cells (see below). Thereafter, the viral load decreases over 12-20 weeks to reach a more stable level, known as the viral set point [27] [28] [29] (FIG. 1) . Virus diversification occurs during this decrease in viral load, and multiple escape mutants are selected under the pressure of adaptive immune responses that are first detectable just before peak viraemia 30-33 . In the absence of antiretroviral drug therapy (ART), the set point is maintained by a balance between virus turnover and the immune responses.
 The death rate of infected cells has been calculated from decay curves of viraemia after ART initiation 34 . For most infected memory T cells, the half-life is less than a day 34 . However, other cell populations have slower rates of decay 35 , and cell populations other than CD4 + T cells maintain latent pools of HIV-1 (REF. 36). Cells are probably latently infected within days of HIV-1 transmission and are unlikely to be removed by natural or vaccine-stimulated anti-HIV-1 immune responses, given that they cannot be eliminated by ART 37 .
 Activation of innate cells and B and T cells is a striking feature of acute HIV-1 infection of humans and SIV infection of rhesus macaques, and it persists to a varying degree into chronic infection. The dysregulation of immune cells is not limited to cells that are infected by, or are specific for, HIV-1 (REF. 38). Chronic immune activation is not observed in naturally SIV-infected sooty mangabeys, in which the infections rarely progress to AIDS. This is despite high levels of virus replication and acute CD4 + T cell depletion 39 , suggesting a role for immune activation in AIDS development. Indeed, there is a positive correlation between markers of CD8 + T cell activation and HIV disease progression 40-42 .
 Immune activation is associated with early and extensive apoptosis of B and T cells, leading to the release of apoptotic microparticles into the blood (FIG. 2) , and increased expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; also known as TMFSF10) and FAS ligand (also known as CD95L), which kill bystander cells and are immunosuppressive 23 . The causes of HIV-associated immune activation established in early HIV-1 infection are not clearly defined 42,43 . Multiple related events (reviewed in REF. 44) probably contribute to such activation, including direct viral infection of immune cells, proinflammatory cytokine production by innate cells (which drives both direct and bystander activation of other immune cells), translocation of microbial products into the blood through damaged intestinal epithelium 21, 22 , loss of virally infected regulatory T (T Reg ) cells and chronic mycobacterial and viral co-infections.
 All attempts to make a vaccine against HIV-1 have failed. Three vaccine approaches have been tested in clinical trials for efficacy. The AIDSVAX glycoprotein (gp)120 vaccine stimulated the production of non-neutralizing antibody to the virus envelope proteins and failed to protect vaccinated individuals from infection 153 . The STEP vaccine, comprised of three recombinant attenuated adenovirus serotype 5 viruses expressing HIV-1 Gag, Pol and Nef, stimulated CD8 + T cell responses to the viral proteins but again showed no protective effect 154, 155 . Similar virus vector-based vaccines have been shown to stimulate simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-specific CD8 + T cell responses in rhesus macaques, and an adenovirus serotype 5 vector expressing Gag protected against challenge with a chimeric SIV-HIV (SHIV89.6p) virus but was not protective against challenge with the more natural SIVmac239 (REF. 156 ). More recent data show that recombinant vaccines that stimulate much broader and stronger CD8 + T cell responses can partially protect against SIVmac239 and SIVmac251 virus challenge, resulting in more attenuated infection with low virus load and prolonged survival of rhesus macaques 113, 157 .
 A third efficacy trial, in Thailand using a canary pox viral vector expressing gp120, Gag and Pol to prime immune responses followed by the AIDSVAX gp120 vaccine to boost the immune response, has been reported recently 146 . This showed for the first time a small protective effect, with 30% fewer vaccine recipients becoming infected with HIV-1 than controls; the result was statistically significant in one of the three analyses made. The volunteer cohort was low risk (annual incidence of infection ~0.3%) and this may be relevant as it may be easier to protect such people than those at high risk. It is not clear whether protection was mediated by antibody, T cells, innate cells or some combination of the three, but those who did become infected did not have reduced virus levels, which is usually seen for protection mediated by T cells in SIV models 113, 157 .
 There is a general consensus in the field that future vaccine approaches should be less empirical and that a deeper understanding of the earliest immune responses to HIV-1 and SIV infection is needed. It will also be important to understand why broad-specificity, neutralizing antibodies are not routinely induced and to determine ways to safely induce them, and to identify what immune responses lead to a better outcome -as in the rare individuals, known as 'elite controllers', who successfully control HIV-1 infection for decades without needing antiretroviral drug therapy 158, 159 .
 In contrast to other pathogens that have infected and selected humans for millennia, HIV-1 is a new pathogen to humans [45] [46] [47] . Therefore, the influence of the host's genetics on the immune response to HIV-1 infection may be more evident. The most dramatic finding in this regard is that homozygosity for a 32 base pair deletion in CCR5, which abrogates its expression, protects almost completely from HIV-1 infection 48 . Furthermore, the HLA alleles HLA-B*5701, HLA-B*5703, HLA-B*5801, HLA-B27 and HLA-B51 are all associated with good control of the virus and a slower progression to AIDS 49 , partly because the epitopes recognized by the T cells in these individuals are focused on conserved regions of the viral Gag protein (see below). A genome-wide association study 50 found a strong protective influence for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located 35 kilobases upstream of the HLA-C locus and confirmed the association of HLA-B57 with a low viral set point. This HLA-C-linked SNP may be associated with low-level expression of HLA-C 50 , which might in turn affect T cell or natural killer (NK) cell function during HIV-1 infection. By contrast, some subtypes of HLA-B35 are associated with rapid disease progression, especially if homozygous 51 , although the mechanism is not understood.
 It has been shown that the expression of the killer immunoglobulin-like receptors KIR3DS1 and KIR3DL1 -which deliver activating and inhibitory signals to NK cells, respectively -delays progression to AIDS in individuals with HLA class I allotypes containing the 80Ile variant of the Bw4 motif 52 , which are thought to be ligands for these receptors 53, 54 . expansion of NK cells that express KIR3DS1 and/or KIR3DL1 during acute HIV-1 infection has been observed but only if the HLA-B Bw4 80Ile motif is present 55 , which is supported by in vitro data demonstrating that NK cells expressing KIR3DS1 control HIV-1 replication efficiently in HLA-B Bw4 80Ile-expressing target cells 56 . It is possible that KIR3DS1 mediates specific recognition of HIV-infected cells by NK cells, although the exact nature of the ligand is elusive. These observations probably reflect an influence of interactions between KIR3DS1 and/or KIR3DL1 and HLA-B Bw4 80Ile on the development and/or functions of NK cells, and possibly CD8 + T cells, which may help to control viral set point.
 Insight into the earliest systemic immune responses to HIV-1 infection has been gained by studying plasma donors who acquired HIV-1 infection. Frequent samples were taken before infection, through peak viraemia and sero-conversion 57, 58 . Samples from different donors were aligned relative to the time that viral RNA was first detectable (100 copies per ml) (T 0 ). The first detectable innate immune response, occurring sometimes just before T 0 , was an increase in the levels of some acute-phase proteins, such as serum amyloid A (H. Kramer and B. Kessler, personal communication). A further wave of acute-phase protein production coincided with a cytokine response (described below) and a rapid increase in plasma viraemia. The production of acute-phase proteins can be triggered by proinflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-1 (IL-1)) and also by extrinsic factors such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is detectable in the plasma during chronic infection with HIV-1 or SIV and may be derived from commensal bacteria that translocate from the gut lumen following depletion of HIV-1-infected intestinal CCR5 + T helper 17 cells 21, 22, 59 . Immunostaining of GALT biopsies collected from acutely infected patients showed higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines than healthy tissues 60 .
 As viraemia increases, so do the levels of cytokines and chemokines in the plasma (FIG. 3) . Levels of IL-15, type I interferons (IFNs) and CXC-chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) increase rapidly but transiently. IL-18, TNF, IFNγ and IL-22 also increase rapidly but are sustained at high levels, whereas the increase in IL-10 is slightly delayed 58 (FIG. 3) . Some of these cytokines have antiviral activity; for example, type I IFNs inhibit HIV replication in severe combined immunodeficient mice reconstituted with human lymphocytes 61 . Also, type I IFNs, IL-15 and IL-18 enhance innate and adaptive immune responses. However, the intense cytokine response during acute HIV infection may also promote viral replication and mediate immunopathology (discussed below).
 The cellular sources of the acute-phase cytokines and chemokines during early HIV-1 infection have not been definitively identified, but probably include infected CD4 + CCR5 + T cells, activated DCs 16 , monocytes, macrophages 21 , NK cells, NKT cells and, subsequently, HIV-specific T cells. The cytokine storm observed during early HIV-1 infection is much greater than that observed in acute hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections 58 , indicating that a systemic cytokine response of this magnitude is not a pre-requisite for viral clearance. The intense cytokine response in acute HIV infection may instead fuel viral replication and mediate immunopathology (discussed below). High-level systemic cytokine responses during acute infections with avian influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus are likewise associated with immunopathological consequences 62, 63 .
 DCs are markedly reduced in number during acute HIV-1 infection 64 (N. Bhardwaj and P.B., unpublished observations). This rapid decline in circulating DCs, particularly plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), may be due to activation-induced cell death or to the migration of activated DCs into lymph nodes, where an increase in DC numbers is observed 65, 66 . In vitro, pDCs become activated by the binding of viral envelope proteins to CD4 expressed by the pDCs followed by virion endocytosis and by the triggering of Toll-like receptor 7 by viral RNA 67 . However, HIV-exposed conventional DCs do not become fully activated and show defective IL-12 production 68 , which is consistent with the low levels of IL-12 observed during acute HIV infection 58 . In addition, HIV-exposed pDCs produce IFNα, which enhances adaptive immune responses. However, HIV-exposed pDCs also produce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which induces the differentiation of CD4 + T cells into T Reg cells that might suppress HIV-specific immune responses 65, 69, 70 . Conventional DCs can prime virus-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses following in vitro exposure to HIV 71 .
 As with most viral infections, NK cells and NKT cells become activated during acute HIV infection 56, 72, 73 . Prior to the peak in viraemia, blood NK cells proliferate and show enhanced activity when tested ex vivo 56 . The NK cell population expressing KIR3DS1 and/ or KIR3DL1 expands during acute infection in individuals that also express HLA-B Bw4 80Ile 55 . NK and NKT cells can control HIV replication through cytolysis of virally infected cells and the production of antiviral cytokines and chemokines. In addition, they can interact with DCs and thereby influence T cell responses. HIV-1 has evolved a strategy to reduce the expression of ligands for NK cell receptors by infected cells 74 . This finding, and the clear role of KIR3D molecules in determining the viral set point 52, 54 , supports the involvement of NK cells in the control of HIV-1. However, the timing of NK cell antiviral effects remains uncertain. NK cells do not contribute to the selection of virus escape mutants before peak viraemia, although it is possible, but not proved, that they account for some of the unexplained mutations that appear together with those that are selected by early T cell responses as viraemia decreases to reach the set point 75 . Alternatively, the antiviral effects of NK (and/or NKT) cells might have a greater influence at later time points.
 Can the protective potential of innate immune responses be harnessed by vaccination? Because NK cells share some characteristics with memory cells after their initial activation 76, 77 , it may be possible to prime their antiviral activity through vaccination. However, the activation of innate immunity should be attempted with caution, as innate immune responses can also be harmful. For example, induction of mucosal inflammatory responses by some microbicides has led to increased acquisition of HIV-1 infection (reviewed in REF. 78 ). Furthermore, as discussed earlier, activated DCs can transmit virus to CD4 + T cells produced by pDCs can recruit susceptible CD4 + T cells to the foci of infection 16, 79 . Immune activation induced by innate immune cells and the resulting production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines can promote HIV-1 replication. Type I IFNs and TNF also have pro-apoptotic effects and can thereby contribute to a loss of activated DCs and the bystander destruction of CD4 + T cells and B cells. The opposing effects of innate immune activation were highlighted in a study in which IL-15 was administered to treat acute SIV infection in rhesus macaques: NK cell and SIV-specific CD8 + T cell numbers were increased, resulting in fewer SIV-infected cells in lymph nodes, but the activation and proliferation of CD4 + T cells was enhanced and a higher viral load was established 80 . Therefore, vaccine-induced activation of innate immune responses will have to be thoroughly tested in the macaque SIV model and used with caution in humans.
 A few studies have measured HIV-1-specific CD8 + T cell responses during early HIV-1 infection, before the first antibodies are detectable 30,31,33,81 (Fiebig stages I or II 82 ). Similar to SIV infection in macaques, the first T cell responses to HIV-1 infection arise as viraemia approaches its peak, and the T cell response peaks 1-2 weeks later, as viraemia declines. The homogeneity of the founder virus at the time of the peak of viraemia [12] [13] [14] indicates that there is no immune-driven selection of escape mutants as viraemia increases.
 Following the peak in the CD8 + T cell response, the virus sequence starts to change dramatically. Rapid selection of mutations occurs at discrete sites in the virus genome as viraemia declines to the viral set point 14, 83 (FIG. 4) . Detailed analysis of four patients during the very early stages of infection 75 indicated that most of the amino acid changes in the virus were selected by CD8 + T cells that recognize epitopes expressed by the founder virus but not by the escape mutant virus. Mutations in the viral envelope protein that were selected by neutralizing antibodies appeared later, at ~12 weeks. A minority of virus escape mutants were not associated with demonstrable T cell responses: a few mutations were probably reversions from the sequence of the transmitted virus that was selected by T cells in the patient's sexual partner; others may have been selected by antibody-dependent cell-mediated virus inhibition or by NK cells. Notably, T cell-and antibody-mediated selection of viral escape mutants rarely involved a single amino acid change in the epitope; most mutants involved multiple changes such that various mutants were 'tested' until the fittest were selected 75 . The first T cell-selected mutations could replace the original sequence of the founder virus within 10 days, and were then followed by sequential selection of escape mutations at different epitopes. This pattern continues throughout the course of HIV infection 75 . Changes in sequence could involve amino acids that are upstream of the T cell epitope and are probably important for antigen processing [84] [85] [86] .
 The earliest T cell responses are often specific for Env and Nef 75, 87 . Responses to other viral proteins, including the conserved Gag p24 and Pol proteins, tended to arise during later waves of T cell responses and may be more important for maintaining the viral load at the set point than for controlling early viraemia 75, 87, 88 . often, the first T cell responses decline rapidly when the escape mutations are selected, or they may decline through exhaustion 75, 87 . The loss of T cells after virus mutation implies complete loss of the epitope and no tendency for the virus to revert to the original sequence because of loss of fitness.
 The finding that escape mutants appeared so rapidly raises questions regarding the effectiveness of the early T cell response. A mathematical model has provided some answers 75 . The rapid loss of the founder virus sequence and its replacement by escape mutant viruses implies complete CD8 + T cell-mediated inhibition of virus production by infected cells. From the rate of loss of founder virus sequence, the fraction of cells killed per day was calculated to be 0.15-0.35 for the earliest T cell responses 75 . As a virus-infected cell has a lifespan of 1 day in vivo, this means that 15-35% of infected cells must be killed prematurely by a single T cell response, which must reduce virus production. Therefore, CD8 + T cells curb viraemia in acute HIV-1 infection. However, selection of escape mutants would as the founder virus and if the earliest responses were not immediately succeeded by new T cell responses to new (mutated) epitopes, which in turn may select further escape mutants 75 (FIG. 4) . Ultimately, responding T cells target epitopes that are more highly conserved and in which escape occurs at a cost to the fitness of the virus. Such immunodominant responses to more highly conserved epitopes are more likely to result in a lower level of viraemia at the set point 89 . When a virus that has undergone such escape mutations is transmitted, its set point is also lower in the new host 90 . The level of set point viraemia is therefore influenced by the nature of the transmitted virus and the specificity of early CD8 + T cell responses. Immunodominant T cell responses to the more conserved immunodominant virus epitopes are likely to result in a lower viral set point 89 .
 CD8 + T cells are also important for the maintenance of viral set point. There have been many reports of virus escape mutations from around the time the set point is reached 30,32,84,85,91-99 . Using the same mathematical models as described earlier, CD8 + T cells are thought to make only a small contribution (killing 4-6% of virus-infected cells per day) to infected-cell death during chronic infection 100 , the rest being due to virus cytopathicity or infected-cell activation. However, this may be an underestimate of the T cell contribution because of the fitness costs of the escape mutations on the virus, such that mutant viruses grow more slowly than the founder virus. Some of the epitopes that are recognized by the T cells during later stages of infection are so highly conserved that the virus must undergo compensating mutations at other sites for escape to occur 75, 94, 97, 98, 101 , which slows the outgrowth of the mutant viruses. The calculation is further confounded by the difficulty of simultaneous virus escape from more than one T cell response 13, 85, 91 . In contrast to the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection when the range of epitopes recognized by the T cell response is narrow, the later response is broad, often directed against more than 10 epitopes 102 . Responses to conserved epitopes are probably important in the long-term control of viral load, because patients with HLA-B27, HLA-B*5701, HLA-B*5703 or HLA-B*5801 that do well clinically have CD8 + T cells that recognize less-variable regions of the virus, particularly in Gag. The HIV-1 quasispecies in these patients do escape slowly during long-term infection, but each escape mutant incurs a proved fitness cost to the virus 101 . The time it takes for the first T cell responses to become targeted to conserved epitopes might be important in determining long-term control of viral infection 75, 88, 99 . It is not clear what features determine which CD8 + T cell epitopes will become immunodominant; it is clear that HLA type is important, but the precursor frequency of naive T cells that are specific for HIV proteins is also likely to be a factor that is probably influenced both by genetics and a history of previous (cross-reactive) antigen exposure. Vaccines could influence this.
 HIV-1 infects and significantly depletes memory CD4 + T cells 25, 79 , and HIV-1-specific CD4 + T cells are particularly susceptible to HIV-1 infection 103 . CD4 + T cell responses to HIV proteins have always been difficult to show, and there is a disparity between the measurements of CD4 + T cell responses to antigen when observing cytokine production versus proliferation 104 . Nevertheless, several epitopes for CD4 + T cells have been identified, particularly in Gag 105 . expansion of HIV-specific CD4 + T cell responses occurs in acute HIV-1 infection, but such responses decline rapidly 106, 107 ; although, very early administration of ART, to control viraemia and prevent the killing of CD4 + T cells, can rescue strong HIV-1 CD4 + T cell responses 108, 109 . However, even with the probably suboptimal help from the weakened CD4 + T cell repertoire, the first CD8 + T cell responses are strong, although their progression into long-term memory cells could be impaired. The rapid decline of CD8 + T cell responses observed after the founder epitope is eliminated from the virus in the plasma, owing to escape mutations 75 , is consistent with the impaired longterm CD8 + T cell memory that has been observed in a model in which mice were depleted of CD4 + T cells 110 .
 The findings described above suggest a role for CD8 + T cells in the earliest immune control of acute HIV-1 infection. CD8 + T cells develop abnormally 111 and become dysfunctional as HIV-1 infection progresses (reviewed in REF. 112 ), but the early HIV-1-specific CD8 + T cell response seems to be functionally normal 109 
 Although not all the factors that contribute to a low virus set point and good long-term prognosis (without ART) are known, it is clear that CD8 + T cells are important components. If a vaccine cannot completely prevent infection, there should be a benefit from stimulating appropriate CD8 + T cell responses, as shown recently in the macaque SIV model 113 . An effective vaccine would need to stimulate CD8 + T cell responses to multiple epitopes, especially to those that are highly conserved. It would also be favourable to stimulate a broad T cell response that recognizes common variants of the founder virus epitope sequence, which would limit escape options 114, 115 .
 Antibodies that neutralize autologous virus develop slowly, arising ~12 weeks or longer after HIV-1 transmission [116] [117] [118] . Antibodies that show some degree of neutralization of heterologous virus eventually arise in ~20% of patients years after infection 117, 119, 120 . To determine the specificity and kinetics of antibody production after HIV-1 transmission and to understand why broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies are not made during acute HIV infection, it is important to study the earliest B cell responses to the transmitted virus 117, 118 .
 Env-specific antibody responses to autologous, consensus Env epitopes were determined in the same plasma donor cohort as described earlier for innate immunity 57 . The first detectable B cell response was found to occur 8 days after T 0 in the form of immune complexes, whereas the first free antibody in the plasma was specific for Env glycoprotein (gp)41 and appeared 13 days after T 0 . By contrast, the appearance of Env gp120-specific antibodies was delayed an additional 14 days, as was the production of other nonneutralizing Env-specific antibodies 57, 118, [121] [122] [123] (FIG. 5; TABLE 1 ). The first HIV-1specific IgA responses in mucosal secretions, which were detected within the first 3 weeks after T 0 , also recognized gp41 during acute HIV infection (N. L. Yates and G.D.T., unpublished observations). A study that applied mathematical modelling to early viral dynamics indicated that the initial gp41-specific IgG and IgM responses did not significantly affect the early dynamics of plasma viral load 57 . These acute gp41-and gp120-specific antibodies did not select escape mutations, indicating that these early arising antibodies are ineffective against HIV-1. Similar analyses of the effect of the initial immune complexes and gp41-specific IgA responses on viral dynamics are needed to understand the interplay between the initial host antibody responses and virus replication. It is not known why the initial antibody response to Env is non-neutralizing; it may relate to the immunodominance of denatured or non-functional Env forms 124, 125 . The first antibodies to induce escape mutants are autologous-virus-neutralizing antibodies that develop ~12 or more weeks after transmission (TABLE 1) . Fc receptor (FcR)-mediated and complement-associated anti-HIV effector functions have also been reported during primary infection [126] [127] [128] ; however, further studies are required to define their role and capacity to select escape mutations.
 The range of epitopes bound by the first (specific to autologous virus) neutralizing antibodies in HIV-1 clade C infection is narrow and epitopes are often restricted to certain virus isolates 129 . Similar to infections with clade B HIV-1, the initial autologous-virusneutralizing antibodies induced in clade C infections are induced with similar kinetics and are usually specific only for the initially transmitted Env variant 116, 117 . Although the autologous-virus-neutralizing antibody response can control the virus quasispecies present when these antibodies appear in infections with HIV-1 clade B or C viruses, the narrowness of the response allows rapid viral escape 116,117 (K. Bar and G. Shaw, personal communication).
 Interestingly, antibodies specific for the conserved regions of HIV-1 Env -such as the carbohydrate epitope recognized by the unique broad-specificity neutralizing monoclonal antibody 2G12 (REF. 130 ), the CD4-binding site recognized by the monoclonal antibody 1b12 (REF. 131 ) and the membrane-proximal region recognized by the monoclonal antibodies 2F5, Z13 and 4E10 (REFS 132-134) -are rarely generated during HIV-1 infection; when they do occur, they develop only after ~20-30 months of infection 57, 119, 120, 135 . These observations indicate that both genetic factors and maturation of the antibody response to HIV-1 are necessary for the generation of this rare, late, broadspecificity, neutralizing antibody response. Affinity maturation through somatic hypermutation may be crucial for the generation of these neutralizing antibodies and may be delayed because of impaired CD4 + T cell help. Because the 2F5, 4E10 and 1b12 monoclonal antibodies have long hydrophobic complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences and show polyreactivity for autologous molecules, it has been suggested that B cell regulatory mechanisms such as self tolerance may control their production 136 .
 Acute HIV-1 infection profoundly affects blood and tissue B cells 123 
 The finding that the generation of potentially protective antibodies is delayed until after initial control of viraemia ~12 weeks after transmission and then focused on only a few epitopes implies that it will be important to develop a vaccine that primes a very early and broad antibody response that targets multiple neutralizing epitopes for effective control of early viral expansion; the natural process is too little, too late. The early perturbations to B cells by the virus similarly indicate the need for a vaccine that either has high levels of durable protective antibody responses or primes in order to induce a rapid secondary response. The rarity of broad-specificity, neutralizing antibody responses to conserved epitopes in Env emphasizes the need to search for and find those small B cell subsets that can make broad-specificity, neutralizing antibodies: immunogens and adjuvants are needed that target those specific B cells.
 A clear picture of the earliest immune responses to HIV-1 (FIG. 5) has major implications for HIV-1 prevention in general and for vaccine design. After transmission, there is probably only a 5-10 day window during the eclipse phase in which the virus-infected cells could be eradicated, before the virus spreads widely and integrates to generate long-lasting and noneradicable reservoirs of latent virus. True sterilizing immunity can be attained only if the virus is prevented from infecting any host cells. This could be achieved only through broadspecificity neutralizing antibodies that are already present in the plasma and at mucosal sites before virus transmission. In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that local application, or intravenous injection, of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SIV in macaques is protective against subsequent challenge with the virus [141] [142] [143] [144] .
 If neutralizing antibodies cannot be generated in sufficient quantity, affinity and breadth, other immune mechanisms could abort the infection by attacking the founder virus and/or the first infected cells. CD8 + T cell-mediated killing, antibody-mediated mechanisms dependent on FcRs (including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)), NK cell-mediated lysis and β-chemokine release all have the potential to prevent early infection. However, to prevent infection these effector mechanisms would have to be ready primed, as there is not time to activate and expand central memory CD8 + T cells 145 , for example, before chronic infection is established.
 Harnessing NK cells and NKT cells might be an effective strategy to control the increase of virally infected cells during the eclipse phase or during the increase in viraemia of early HIV-1 infection. Although it may be hazardous to induce chronic hyperactivation of these cells as a means to inhibit virus infection, it may be possible to immunize subjects with HIV-1 antigens such as peptides that specifically expand potentially protective NK and NKT cell subpopulations, thereby altering the cell repertoire to contain a higher proportion of protective NK cells 76, 77 .
 The modest protection offered by the vaccines used in the recent RV144 clinical trial carried out in Thailand with volunteers at low risk of HIV-1 infection 146 (BOX 1) may be an example of weak immune responses combining to raise the threshold for infection -a rare event.
 Once infection starts to spread, enhancing the natural containment processes might be the only immunological option to benefit infected individuals. CD8 + T cell responses, which are clearly effective in reducing the peak viraemia during acute infection, could be enhanced through vaccination by increasing their breadth of epitope recognition so that, rather than mediating sequential responses to single epitopes, there would be a simultaneous multi-epitope-specific CD8 + T cell response to the virus 113, 147, 148 . Focusing this response on conserved epitopes, for which escape incurs a fitness cost to the virus, would be desirable. Strategies for enhancing or preserving CD4 + T cell help would also be of benefit for supporting the CD8 + T cells. However, it is important to recognize that CD8 + T cells are highly sensitive to single amino acid variation in epitope peptides 75, 149 , so even minor mismatches between vaccine-encoded epitopes and viral epitopes could be a serious problem and could diminish the effectiveness of any vaccine-stimulated T cell response.
 If a vaccine can induce greater breadth in early T and B cell responses to HIV-1 than occurs naturally during acute infection, then the use of a combination of protective epitopes in a preventative vaccine may control the early dissemination of HIV-1, resulting in a lower viral set point and better long-term immune control. Preliminary unpublished results with experimental vaccines that include multiple common variants of HIV-1 proteins such as Gag (mosaic vaccines) have been shown to enhance the breadth and magnitude of T cell responses in animal studies [150] [151] [152] . This approach and other novel strategies for expanding the breadth of induced Env-specific B cell responses are also central to improving the prospects of vaccine success.
 It can be thought to be good news that most HIV-1 transmissions that result in productive infection are mediated by only one virion, indicating a vulnerability of the virus to immune attack during the eclipse phase. This suggests that a well-designed vaccine strategy might have a chance of achieving good (if not perfect) control around the time of acute peak viraemia, preventing the onset of damaging chronic immune activation and damage to generative immune cell environments. However, vaccine strategies must be developed that potentiate what is clearly a qualitatively and quantitatively insufficient immune response in the first few weeks of HIV-1 infection. It is hoped that both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system can be harnessed to develop an HIV-1 vaccine that ensures that adequate immune protection is in place before transmission, enabling earlier, broader and more effective secondary responses for preventing or controlling acute HIV-1 infection. 
 The time at which plasma viraemia settles to a stable level (within approximately 3-6 months from the onset of HIV infection). Viral set point is partially predictive of both how quickly HIV infection will progress and the risk of HIV transmission.
 A transmitted virus or a virus that gives rise to all virus quasispecies in an infected individual.
 The ability of a virus to replicate in a given environment. By definition in in vitro studies, a drug-resistant virus has greater ability to replicate than wild-type virus when measured in the presence of a drug, similarly a T cell escape mutant will replicate better than wild-type virus when co-cultured with specific T cells. The T cell-resistant or drug-resistant virus may replicate less well than the wild type when the selective force is withdrawn.

The Bw4 motif is involved in the recognition of certain HLA alleles by killer immunoglobulin-like receptors.
 Development of a detectable concentration of pathogen-specific antibodies in the serum as a result of infection or immunization. Seroconversion normally occurs in patients with HIV-1 infection 3-4 weeks following infection, around Fiebig stage III, typically when plasma virus loads are reaching their peak.
 A group of proteins, including C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, complement components and fibrinogen, that are secreted into the blood in increased or decreased quantities by hepatocytes in response to trauma, inflammation or disease. These proteins can be inhibitors or mediators of inflammatory processes.
 A subset of CD4 + T helper cells that produce interleukin-17 and that are thought to be important in antibacterial and antifungal immunity and may also have a role in autoimmune diseases. Their generation involves IL-23 and IL-21, as well as the transcription factors RORγt (retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-γt) and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3).
 Envelope proteins of HIV are initially produced as a precursor glycoprotein of 160 kDa (gp160) that is cleaved to generate gp120 and gp41. Three gp120 molecules and three gp41 molecules are thought to combine in a trimer to form the envelope spike.

The time between infection and the first detection of viral RNA in the plasma is referred to as the eclipse phase. Plasma virus levels then increase exponentially, peaking at 21-28 days after infection, and this is followed by a slower decrease in plasma viral RNA levels. Patients can be categorized into Fiebig stages I-VI, which are based on a sequential gain in positive HIV-1 clinical diagnostic assays (viral RNA measured by PCR, p24 and p31 viral antigens measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), HIV-1-specific antibody detected by ELISA and HIV-1specific antibodies detected by western blot). Patients progress from acute infection through to the early chronic stage of infection at the end of Fiebig stage V, approximately 100 days following infection, as the plasma viral load begins to plateau. b | Fundamental events in acute HIV-1 infection. Following HIV-1 infection, the virus first replicates locally in the mucosa and is then transported to draining lymph nodes, where further amplification occurs. This initial phase of infection, until systemic viral dissemination begins, constitutes the eclipse phase. The time when virus is first detected in the blood is referred to as T 0 ; after this there is an exponential increase in plasma viraemia to a peak 21-28 days after infection. By this time, significant depletion of mucosal CD4 + T cells has already occurred. Around the time of peak viraemia, patients may become symptomatic and reservoirs of latent virus are established in cells that have a slower rate of decay than CD4 + T cells. The 'window of opportunity' between transmission and peak viraemia, prior to massive CD4 + T cell destruction and the establishment of viral reservoirs, is the narrow but crucial period in which an HIV-1 vaccine must control viral replication, prevent extensive CD4 + T cell depletion and curb generalized immune activation.

An increase in the level of soluble tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; also known as TNFSF10) in the plasma is the first evidence of infection-induced apoptosis and/or immune activation and it occurs before the peak in viraemia. This increase in TRAIL also coincides with the appearance of high levels of interferon-α (IFNα; see FIG. 3 ). Soon thereafter increases in the number of apoptotic microparticles are observed, followed by increased levels of soluble TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2; also known as TNFRSF1B) and soluble FAS ligand. A portion of the microparticles express CC-chemokine receptor 5, suggesting that they originate from cellular targets of HIV-1 infection. The appearance of these soluble components in the plasma early during HIV-1 infection probably represents a pathological rather than a protective cascade of events that is a cause of, or is associated with, virus-induced CD4 + T cell death. b | Electron micrograph of apoptotic microparticles and exosomes in the plasma from a patient with acute HIV-1 infection. There are ~700-fold more microparticles than virions present in acute HIV-1 infection. Part a is based on data from REF. 23 
 The virus escape mutations occurring in a single representative patient during acute HIV-1 infection. The changes in plasma virus load (a) and the emergence of amino acid changes (b) are shown. At the first time point, when the patient was virus positive but seronegative (Fiebig stage II), the founder virus (which was clade B) showed no evidence of immune selection. Thereafter there is an increasing number of selected sites at which the founder virus sequence is completely altered by, usually a cluster of, amino acid changes. Those marked in red were selected early (within 50 days from peak viraemia) by demonstrable CD8 + T cell responses. Those in purple were selected later by CD8 + T cells. Those in light green are single amino acid reversions to the clade B virus consensus sequence. Those in blue were mutations in V1 and V3 of the env gene selected by neutralizing antibodies.
 Those in grey were selected through undefined means, possibly by T cells, natural killer cells or antibodies. Yellow represents changes that co-varied with another mutation. LTR, long terminal repeat. Figure is based on data from REF. 75 . The first systemically detectable immune responses to HIV-1 infection are the increases in levels of acute-phase proteins in the plasma, which are observed when virus replication is still largely restricted to the mucosal tissues and draining lymph nodes (eclipse phase). When virus is first detected in the plasma (T 0 ), broad and dynamic increases in plasma cytokine levels are also observed. Within days, as plasma viraemia is still increasing exponentially, the first antibody-virus immune complexes are detected. Expansion of the earliest HIV-1-specific CD8 + T cell responses also commences prior to peak viraemia, followed by detection of the first free glycoprotein (gp)41-specific but non-neutralizing IgM antibodies. Complete virus escape from the first CD8 + T cell responses can occur rapidly, within 10 days of T cell expansion. By this time, viral reservoirs exist, possibly becoming established within days of infection. The earliest autologous-virus-neutralizing antibodies are detected around day 80 following infection, as viral loads are still declining prior to the onset of the viral set point. Antibody escape virus mutants emerge in the plasma within the following week.",866ee0d70efc9713979aa032d14d22dfe7575f7a,2009-12-11,"McMichael, Andrew J.; Borrow, Persephone; Tomaras, Georgia D.; Goonetilleke, Nilu; Haynes, Barton F.",Nature Reviews Immunology,10.1038/nri2674,Nature Reviews Immunology,351.0,True,"Depletion of amino acids or growth factors induces autophagy by inhibiting mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a master regulator of metabolism that inhibits the ULK1 complex through phosphorylation under nutrient replete conditions (Box 1). PI3P binding proteins then recruit the ATG16L1 complex to this autophagosome precursor site (isolation membrane) 4 . Next, LC3-PE mediates membrane tethering and fusion to extend the isolation membrane through recruiting lipids, which are likely derived from multiple membrane sources including endosomal vesicles harboring the transmembrane protein ATG9L1. Inhibition of mTORC1, such as through nutrient deprivation, allows the ULK1 complex to activate the PI3KC3 complex (see the figure) . ATG16L1 noncovalently binds the ATG5-ATG12 conjugate to form a multimeric complex. In parallel, another UBL molecule, LC3, is processed by the ATG4 protease and subjected to a second UBL conjugation reaction involving ATG7 and ATG3. The ATG16L1 complex conjugates LC3 and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to complete the reaction. Subsequent fusion with the lysosome, mediated by class C VPS and SNARE-like proteins, leads to the degradation of the contents. First, the general function of autophagy in immunity will be summarized. The focus of the second section will be on specific modes of intersection between autophagy and immune pathways, especially signaling downstream of innate immune sensors. The third section will provide examples of how these mechanisms contribute to multicellular immune responses, with an emphasis on adaptive immunity and inflammatory disease. Finally, the barriers for targeting the autophagy pathway to treat disease will be discussed. Some pathogens are neutralized by non-canonical functions of the autophagy machinery, hereon referred to as 'non-canonical autophagy' (Box 2). The recruitment of IFN-γ effector molecules (IRGs and GBPs) to the parasitophorous vacuole during Toxoplasma gondii infection is dependent on the the ATG16L1 complex but not autophagosome formation or lysosomes 11 (see box figure, part d). There are several other examples not depicted. The inhibitory activity of ATG16L1 on NOD1 and NOD2 signaling can occur independently of the autophagy function of this protein 164 . Autophagy also reduces damage inflicted by pathogens. Autophagy is also essential for the survival of mice with S. aureus-mediated bacteremia and pneumonia. Additionally, as the above examples with S. aureus, Sindbis virus, and a large number of other studies illustrate, autophagy usually benefits the host during a lifethreatening infection. As the immune system evolved, autophagy and related pathways have been integrated into the complex signaling networks that coordinate multicellular defense strategies. Also, autophagy can feedback on the process of PAMP and DAMP recognition to serve a regulatory role of preventing an over exuberant response. NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are cytosolic sensors of PAMPs and DAMPs. Many NLRs are inflammasome subunits that mediate IL-1β and IL-18 production and pyroptosis. The NLRP3 inflammasome, for instance, is activated by diverse stimuli that disrupt mitochondrial integrity, including ATP, bacterial products, and uric acid crystals. In addition to these examples in which autophagy limits the availability of inflammasome activators (ROS, mtDNA, LPS) in the cytosol, one study has shown that SQSTM1 can target the inflammasome subunit ASC for incorporation into an autophagosome, leading to its inactivation 36 . Sensing of uric acid and nigericin by NLRP3, or recognition of poly(dA:dT) double-stranded DNA by AIM2, induces autophagy by triggering nucleotide exchange on the small GTPase RalB 36 . Amino acid deprivation also signals through RalB to induce autophagy by creating a large multi-protein complex with the exocyst protein Exo84 that links the ULK1 and PI3KC3 complexes 37 . NLR activation by infectious agents generally induces autophagy. As discussed later, autophagy induction in epithelial cells is critical to the intestinal barrier. These examples indicate that activation of inflammasomes is coupled with induction of autophagy, which most likely reflects the property of inflammasomes as a double-edged sword, where some activity is essential for defense, but excessive cytokine release and pyroptosis cause irreparable damage to the host. Both NOD1 and NOD2 mediate the recruitment of LC3 to vesicles containing internalized bacteria to initiate xenophagy ( Figure  1 ), although there is disagreement regarding whether this process involves signaling through RIP2 or direct binding between the NLR and ATG16L1 [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure, TLR4 promotes the assembly of the PI3KC3 complex through TRAF6-mediated K63 ubiquitination of beclin-1 to free it from an inhibitory interaction with BCL-2 55 . When antibody-bound DNA complexes are internalized by pDCs and bind Fcγ receptor (FcγR), LAP mediates the maturation of the phagosome to a vesicle that supports type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling downstream of TLR9 62 . However, A. fumigatus is unable to evade LAP upon removal of melanin during germination, and is ultimately degraded 8, 64 . These findings demonstrate how autophagy and LAP support vesicle trafficking events that are critical for TLR-mediated cytokine production and pathogen degradation. In contrast to the above examples, there are situations in which autophagy proteins and TLRs have an antagonistic relationship. In keratinocytes, SQSTM1 is targeted for autophagic degradation by virtue of binding to LC3, thereby disrupting TLR4 and TLR2 signaling 66 . Unlike the extensive antagonistic relationship observed between NLRs and autophagy, these situations in which autophagy and TLR signaling inhibit one another have thus far been exceptions and may apply to specific cell types or pathogens. For this reason, cells deficient in autophagy proteins, NLRX1, or COX5b display enhanced IFN-I production and are better able to restrict the replication of a variety of viruses [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] . Autophagy also intersects with pathways responsible for sensing cytosolic DNA, which is associated with viral infection, intracellular bacteria, and autoimmunity. Autophagy also prevents pathological STING activation by targeting damaged DNA that leaks from the nucleus to the lysosome where it is degraded by DNASE2a 76 . Consistent with the role of autophagy in supporting cellular immunity, the Th1 cytokines interferon-γ (IFNγ) and TNFα generally upregulate xenophagy in target cells [79] [80] [81] . IFNγ induces autophagy through the JAK1/JAK2 and p38 MAPK pathway independently of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) 82 . In addition to conventional autophagy, IFNγ induces a LAP-like process in hepatocytes infected by the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax. The deposition of LC3 onto the parasitophorous vacuole leads to the recruitment of lysosomes and killing of the parasite 84 . Cytokines that signal through other STAT molecules do not necessarily induce autophagy. These studies establish a link between autophagy and Th2 or regulatory cytokines. How this impacts host defense requires further investigation. There is less evidence that Th1 and other branches of adaptive immunity benefit from autophagy-deficiency in macrophages and DCs. An inflammatory milieu could also cause T cell exhaustion. As discussed later, the role of autophagy in antigen presentation is another variable that requires consideration. Autophagy is induced by ATP, and controls the secretion of ATP. This function is not mutually exclusive from antimicrobial functions of autophagy such as xenophagy; removing the infectious threat and removing the PAMP that triggers the inflammatory response are both ways to restore homeostasis. Inhibiting autophagy in regulatory T cells (Tregs) causes apoptosis and lineage instability due to aberrant metabolism, which leads to unrestrained Th2 responses and inflammation at intestinal barrier sites 125, 126 . Specific antigens have been shown to depend on autophagy for presentation. Autophagosomes transport peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) that convert arginine to citrulline, which generates the citrullinated self-peptides implicated in rheumatoid arthritis 129 (Figure 3 ). Autophagy in virally-infected cells generate antigens for presentation to CD4 T cells by delivering cytosolic proteins to the lysosome for antigen processing, such as the Epstein-Barr virus protein EBNA-1 130 (Figure 3 ). Now that the tools are available, future studies will be able to distinguish the role of canonical versus non-canonical forms of autophagy in antigen presentation. Genetic variants that occur near or within autophagy genes are implicated in several inflammatory disorders ( Table 1) . The relevance of these epithelial-specific functions of autophagy is supported by the observation that knock-in mice harboring the ATG16L1 T300A disease variant are susceptible to enteric bacterial infections, and display defects in Paneth cells and goblet cells 48, 49 . NPC1 mutation inhibits NOD2-mediated xenophagy 155 . Thus, restoration of autophagy may ameliorate many chronic inflammatory disorders. Through these functions, the autophagy machinery controls complex multicellular immune responses at the whole organism level. These three themes have implications for the clinical application of autophagy inducers and inhibitors. It is important to remind ourselves that the measure of an effective immune response is not how vigorous it is, but how efficiently the threat is neutralized without damaging the host. Finally, defects in autophagy coincide with aging, metabolic disease, cancer, myopathies, and neurodegenerative disorders. These peptides are generated posttranslationally by peptidylarginine deiminases. It most commonly affects the lower portion of the small intestine, resulting in symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever and weight loss. Affected patients suffer from increased susceptibility to recurrent infections. • Extensive crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory signaling cascades ensures a robust immune response towards pathogens while avoiding collateral damage to the host. Several chronic inflammatory disorders are associated with autophagy dysfunction. • Autophagy can increase and decrease different parts of the same inflammatory signaling cascade in a context-dependent manner. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 November 01. In addition to inhibiting pathogen replication, this process reduces leakage of bacterial LPS to prevent activation of the casapse-11 inflammasome. IL-10 can inhibit autophagy by promoting binding between STAT3 and PKR, which inhibits activation of eIF2α (c). Extracellular IL-1β signals through the IL-1R and MYD88 to induce autophagy, and autophagosome maturation and degradation of engulfed material including intracellular bacteria is dependent on TBK1 (d). Autophagy activity in T cells, antigen presenting cells (APCs), and dying cells affects T cell immunity. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) in autophagosomes generate citrullinated peptides, thereby affecting the repertoire of antigens being presented. Autophagy-mediated release of ATP by dying cells, such as those infected by viruses, leads to engulfment by the APC."
55,55,528bfcf1a4b7b7f134a87bd9bb9c13ab47a0d363,,The multifaceted biology of plasmacytoid dendritic cells,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a unique dendritic cell subset that specializes in the production of type I interferons (IFNs). pDCs promote antiviral immune responses and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases characterized by a type I IFN signature. However, pDCs can also induce tolerogenic immune responses. Here, we review recent progress from the field of pDC biology, focusing on: the molecular mechanisms that regulate pDC development and functions; the pathways involved in their sensing of pathogens and endogenous nucleic acids; the function of pDCs at mucosal sites; and their roles in infections, autoimmunity and cancer.
 A common DC progenitor (CDP) that generates both pDCs and classical DC (cDCs) but not other cell lineages has been identified in the bone marrow. The CDP is characterized by lack of lineage markers (LIN) and expression of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3, also known as CD135), macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR, also known as CD115) and the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT (also known as CD117) 22-26 . Recently, a clonogenic progenitor downstream of CDP with prominent pDC potential has been reported 27 . This progenitor is LIN − KIT int/lo FLT3 + IL-7Rα − and does not express M-CSFR. It expresses high levels of E2-2 (also known as TCF4), the transcription factor that defines the pDC lineage 28 , and can be derived from CDPs under conditions in which is E2-2 is upregulated, i.e. exposure to M-CSF or thrombopoietin. A subsequent step in pDC development is the generation of a CCR9 − pDC-like common DC precursor that expresses some of the phenotypic markers of mature pDCs, such as CD11c, B220 and SiglecH, but has low or negligible levels of MHC class II and CCR9. This CCR9 − pDC-like common DC precursor retains the potential to differentiate into either pDCs or cDCs, depending on the tissue environment 29,30 . Therefore, the conversion of progenitors into pDCs or cDCs may happen not only at the CDP stage of development, but also closer to terminal pDC differentiation.
 Although many studies have focused on pDC differentiation within the myeloid lineage, there is also evidence that pDCs can originate from the lymphoid lineage. The lymphoidprimed multipotent progenitor, delineated as LIN − KIT + SCA1 + CD34 + FLT3 + , can generate the M-CSFR − progenitor with prominent pDC potential described above 27 , which Swiecki and Colonna","Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were originally described in human lymph nodes in the 1950s 1 . These cells were later found to secrete high amounts of type I interferon (IFN; i.e. IFN-α, IFN-β) in response to viruses 2, 3 , thereby corresponding to the enigmatic natural IFNproducing cells identified in human peripheral blood 4, 5 . pDCs specialize in producing type I IFNs following their recognition of viruses or self nucleic acids through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR9 [6] [7] [8] . However, pDCs can also secrete other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-12, CXC-chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), CXCL10, CC-chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) and CCL4. Moreover, expression of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules enables pDCs to present antigens to CD4 + T cells. Thus, the biology of pDCs is multifaceted (Figure 1 ).
 The identification of pDCs in mice in 2001 [9] [10] [11] has bolstered research in the pDC field, permitting exploration of the mechanisms involved in their development and their roles in innate and adaptive immunity. In addition to contributing to innate antiviral immunity, pDCs can participate in the priming of both immunogenic or tolerogenic adaptive immune responses. Human pDCs also continue to be extensively studied with a view to understanding their potential roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, cancer and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In this Review, we discuss the recent progress that has been made in these areas of mouse and human pDC biology. We begin by discussing the phenotype of pDCs and the mechanisms that control their development.
 Human pDCs lack expression of the lineage-associated markers CD3, CD19, CD14, CD16 and CD11c and selectively express the C-type lectin BDCA2 (also known as CLEC4C), and the Ig-superfamily receptor ILT7 12 . Human pDCs also express CD4, CD68, ILT3 and the receptor for IL-3 (also known as CD123). Accordingly, IL-3 mediates human pDC survival in vitro 3 . CD2 is a cell adhesion molecule that is expressed by a subset of human pDCs 13 . CD2 hi pDCs produce lysozyme, but whether this endows them with the capacity to lyse bacteria is unknown. The markers most commonly used to identify pDCs in mice are CD11c, B220, Ly6C, bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2) and SIGLEC-H. In contrast to human pDCs, which are CD11c − , mouse pDCs express intermediate levels of CD11c . BST2 (also known as Tetherin 14 ) is fairly specific to pDCs and plasma cells in steady-state conditions but is induced on many cell types following exposure to type I and type II IFNs 15 . In cell suspensions from primary and secondary lymphoid organs, SIGLEC-H expression is mainly confined to pDCs 16, 17 and is downregulated upon activation 18 . However, specialized macrophage subsets in the spleen, lymph nodes and brain also express SIGLEC-H 17, 19 . In addition, studies in reporter mice have confirmed Siglech mRNA transcription in progenitor cells 18, 20, 21 . Mouse pDCs can also express CD8α and, like human pDCs, CD4. In peripheral tissues, the majority of mouse pDCs express CC chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9), Ly49Q and SCA1; however, in the bone marrow these markers distinguish pDC subsets that differ in developmental stage and/or activation state (Box 1).
 While CCR9, SCA1 and Ly49Q are expressed on the majority of mouse pDCs in the periphery, in the bone marrow these markers have unequal distribution, identifying pDC subsets that differ in their degree of maturation and their capacity to produce IFN-I or pro-inflammatory cytokines. CCR9 − cells are pDC-like common DC precursors, whereas CCR9 + cells are fully differentiated pDCs. CCR9 − pDC-like common DC precursors can respond to TLR stimulation and produce type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines better than mature CCR9 + pDCs 29 . While CCR9 − pDC-like common DC precursors are SCA1 lo , CCR9 + pDCs in the bone marrow can be further divided into SCA1 lo and SCA1 hi subsets. SCA1 lo pDCs are more efficient at producing IFN-α than SCA1 hi pDCs and give rise to SCA1 hi pDCs after activation or exposure to type I IFN 217 . Ly49Q − and Ly49Q + pDCs secrete type I IFN in response to the synthetic TLR9 ligand CpG or herpes simplex virus (HSV), a DNA virus, but Ly49Q − pDCs respond poorly to stimulation with influenza virus, a RNA virus. Ly49Q − pDCs also appear to produce lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after TLR stimulation compared to Ly49Q + pDCs 218 . Two pDC subsets have been defined by CD9 expression 219 . The CD9 + subset has high type I IFN producing and T cell stimulatory capacities and may partially overlap with the nonplasmacytoid, high type I IFN producing DC subset described in the bone marrow 220 and CCR9 − pDC-like common DC precursors.
 In general, studies on bone marrow pDC subsets concur that newly generated pDCs or their close precursors may be more efficient at producing type I IFN than mature pDCs in the bone marrow and in the periphery, at least in response to TLR agonists. However, it has also been reported that pDCs in the periphery and not in the bone marrow are the major source of type I IFN in mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) 221 . Most likely, the relative importance of bone marrow versus peripheral pDCs as sources of type I IFN depends not only on their intrinsic capacity but also on the degree of exposure to viruses or other stimuli that elicit a type I IFN response.
 In conclusion, pDC subsets in bone marrow reflect different stages of development and/or activation and differ in their capacity to produce type I IFN versus proinflammatory cytokines as well as their impact on T cell activation and T cell effector or regulatory functions. Clonogenic assays and consistency among gating strategies and markers used to define pDCs will be essential to determine which populations contain mature pDCs versus those that are heterogeneous and can give rise to different subsets.
 subsequently can differentiate into both Rag1-positive and Rag1-negative mature pDCs. pDCs of lymphoid origin may be distinct from pDCs of myeloid origin, but it has been reported that both myeloid-and lymphoid-derived pDCs can activate lymphoid-specific genetic programs 31 such as nonproductive rearrangements of immunoglogulin or TCR genes and expression of pre-T cell receptor alpha 32-34 . FLT3 and its ligand (FLT3L) are crucial for pDC development 35 . In the absence of FLT3 signaling, pDCs are reduced in number in the lymphoid organs and bone marrow of mice 36, 37 . FLT3L promotes pDC development through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 38, 39 . LAMTOR2 is a member of the Ragulator complex known to inhibit mTOR signaling. Conditional deletion of LAMTOR2 in CD11c + cells (which include cDCs and pDCs) causes accumulation of FLT3 on the cell surface and massive expansion of pDC and cDC populations in older mice 40 . Recently, it was shown that FLT3L and type I IFN act synergistically to promote pDC development from common lymphoid progenitors by inducing upregulation of FLT3 41 . In addition to FLT3 signaling, M-CSF (also known as CSF1) may support the generation of pDCs 42 . Indeed, pDCs can be derived from M-CSFR + CDP 23, 27 and Csf1 −/− mice have reduced numbers of both pDCs and cDCs 43 . By contrast, the growth factor GM-CSF inhibits FLT3L-driven pDC development 44 . GM-CSF-induced STAT5 signaling abolishes pDCrelated gene expression in FLT3 + progenitors and inhibits the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), which is crucial for pDC development, as discussed below 45 .
 E2-2 is the transcription factor essential for committing CDPs to the pDC lineage in both mice and humans 28, 46 (Figure 2 ). E2-2, along with the transcription factors E12, E47 and HEB (also known as TCF12), make up the E family of class I basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors 47 . E proteins form homodimers or heterodimers with each other and bind to conserved E box sequences, a process that can be perturbed by inhibitor of differentiation (ID) proteins. E2-2 binds to a large fraction of pDC-enriched genes and continuous expression of E2-2 in pDCs is required to maintain cell fate 28, 48 . Deletion of E2-2 in mature pDCs causes the loss of pDC-associated markers, spontaneous differentiation into cDC-like cells, upregulation of MHC class II molecules and, ultimately, an increase in the ability to prime T cells 48 . These cDC-like cells are similar to the steadystate noncanonical CX3CR1 + CD8α + DC population that is related to pDCs 49 . CX3CR1 + CD8α + DCs require E2-2 for development, harbor Ig heavy-chain (IgH) D-J rearrangements and are enriched for pDC-specific genes; however, they do not produce type I IFN in response to influenza virus and lack surface expression of classical pDC markers like B220 and BST2. Thus, noncanonical CX3CR1 + CD8α + DCs may represent an alternative fate of pDC-committed cells that are unable to reach or maintain high enough levels of E2-2.
 ID2, a repressor of E2-2, is essentially absent in pDCs, but is prominently expressed in cDCs and supports CD8α + DC development from CDPs 28, 50 . pDC numbers are increased in Id2 −/− mice 50 STAT3 and STAT5 help to regulate the balance between E and ID proteins during DC development by controlling the expression of E2-2 and ID2, respectively 52 . STAT3 stimulates FLT3L-dependent expression of E2-2, whereas STAT5 induces GM-CSFdependent expression of ID2 ( Figure 2) . A recent study also identified a transcriptional cofactor of the ETO family, MTG16, as a key factor that represses ID2, thereby driving pDC differentiation and restricting cDC development (Figure 2 ) 53 .
 Transcriptional targets of E2-2 in pDCs encode proteins involved in the development, homeostasis and function of pDCs, including the transcription factors SPIB, BCL11A, IRF8, RUNX2 and CIITA; the cell surface markers BDCA2, ILT7, SIGLEC-H; and the nucleic acid sensors TLR7, TLR9 and PACSIN1 28,48,54 ( Figure 2 ).
 SPIB is a transcription factor critical for the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors into pDCs and controls the survival of pDCs and their progenitors through induction of the antiapoptotic gene BCL2-A1 [55] [56] [57] [58] . pDC numbers are reduced in the bone marrow of Spib −/− mice but are increased in the periphery, suggesting impaired retention in the bone marrow 59 . Furthermore, Spib −/− pDCs exhibit attenuated expression of pDC-specific genes and display defects in type I IFN production following TLR7 or TLR9 stimulation. SPIB was also recently shown to be a novel immunohistochemical marker for the identification of human blastic pDC neoplasms 56 .
 BCL11A is necessary for the expression of IL-7R and FLT3 in early hematopoietic progenitor cells and wildtype mice reconstituted with Bcl11a −/− fetal liver have severely reduced numbers of pDCs 60 . Moreover, genome-wide analyses of DNA binding has revealed that BCL11A regulates transcription of E2-2, Id2 and Mtg16 61 , thereby inducing a positive feedback loop for pDC development. IRF8 is essential for pDC and CD8α + DC development: IRF8 deficiency results in the absence of pDCs and a reduction in the numbers of CD8α + DCs 62 , as well as a decrease in all splenic DC subsets after competitive reconstitution of irradiated mice with wildtype and Irf8 −/− bone marrow 63 . Loss of pDCs, cDCs and monocytes in an individual with an IRF8 mutation that impairs DNA binding and transactivation has also been reported 64 .
 factor independent 1 (GFI1) and nuclear polyadenylated RNA-binding protein 2 (NAB2). Mice that express low levels of IKAROS lack peripheral pDCs, but not other DC subsets, and are impaired in their ability to produce type I IFNs in response to TLR7 or TLR9 ligands 222 . PU.1 directly regulates FLT3 expression in a concentration-dependent manner and is necessary for both pDC and cDC development 223 . XBP1 is a target of the unfolded protein response sensor IRE-1α that maintains endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and prevents activation of cell death pathways 224 . XBP1 deficiency results in impaired survival and reduced numbers of pDCs and cDCs 225 . Treatment of pDCs with the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib reduces the active form of XBP1 and suppresses pDC survival and immunostimulatory functions by targeting ER homeostasis and the intracellular trafficking of TLRs 226 . Hypoxia-inducible factors influence hematopoiesis and maintain HSC function. Recently, it was shown that low oxygen content upregulates ID2 and suppresses FLT3L-induced pDC development, in a manner dependent on HIF1α 227 . GFI1 controls the development and functions of pDCs and cDCs in a STAT3dependent manner 228 and represses Rag transcription in pDCs 229 . NAB2 is a transcriptional corepressor that induces TRAIL expression in activated pDCs 230 . TRAILexpressing pDCs are tumoricidal 231 and induce apoptosis of CD4 + T cells in HIV viremic patients or after exposure to HTLV1 [232] [233] [234] .
 MicroRNAs represent another class of regulatory molecules that control different aspects of pDC development and function. miR-22 is induced in progenitor cultures by GM-CSF and it targets Irf8 mRNA for post-transcriptional repression 235 . Overexpression of miR-22 during DC development promotes the expansion of CD11b + cDC populations at the expense of pDCs. Epigenetic or chromatin modifiers may also have a prominent role in DC lineage commitment and development. In support of this, histone deacetylation is required for PU.1 recruitment to target genes (including Flt3, Irf8 and PU.1 itself) and for pDC differentiation from progenitors 236 .
 In conclusion, while E2-2 is the master transcription factor for pDC development, it is becoming clear that E2-2 is a component of a multi-protein complex that includes both positive and negative regulators. More studies are required to define the various components of this complex as well as the genomic regions that interact with this complex and drive the expression of molecules that define pDC phenotype and function.
 Initial studies showed that pDC migration is quite different from that of cDCs. Following their development in the bone marrow, pDCs circulate in the blood and reach T cell areas of lymph nodes mainly through high endothelial venules (HEVs) and not through afferent lymphatics 67, 68 . In addition to secondary lymphoid organs, pDCs also migrate from blood into peripheral tissues. pDC migration involves CD62L, PSGL1, β1 and β2 integrins and multiple chemokine receptors, such as CXCR4, CCR7, CXCR3, CCR5, CCR2, CCR6, CCR10 and CCR9 ( Figure 3 ) 68, 69 .
 CXCR4 is required for the retention of pDCs in the bone marrow stromal niche and their development 70 . CXCR4 and CCR7 mediate the migration of pDCs into the splenic white Swiecki pulp 71 . CXCR4 also promotes pDC recruitment to tumors that produce CXCL12 72 . During inflammation, CXCR3 and CCR5 drive pDC migration into inflamed tissues 73,74 . CCR2, which is expressed with a bimodal distribution on pDCs 65 , drives recruitment of pDCs to the skin following inflammation induced by topical application of imiquimod 75 . CCR6 and CCR10 are expressed by a subset of pDCs in human tonsil and facilitate migration to inflamed epithelia in response to CCL20 and CCL27 76 . pDC recruitment to the thymus and small intestine requires CCR9 77,78 , whereas pDC migration into the colon is CCR9independent 79 . MAdCAM-1 and β7 integrin were recently shown to promote pDC trafficking into the intestinal intraepithelial compartment 80 . pDCs can also migrate in response to engagement of receptors for chemerin (ChemR23), adenosine, as well as C3a and C5a, which are released at sites of tissue damage 68 . CX3CR1 is expressed by pDCs; however, its role in pDC migration and homeostasis is not well characterized.
 Several studies have recently identified intracellular proteins that selectively impact pDC trafficking in the steady-state and in disease. Human and mouse pDCs express CD2associated protein (CD2AP) 81 , an intracellular protein that regulates actin dynamics and promotes pDC migration to lymph nodes during inflammation 82 . DOCK2, a hematopoietic cell-specific CDM (Caenorhabditis elegans Ced-5, mammalian DOCK180 and Drosophila melanogaster myoblast city) protein, is necessary for migration of pDCs to lymph nodes and the periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths of the spleen 83 . Chemokine-induced Rac activation is severely impaired in Dock2 −/− pDCs, resulting in the reduction of motility and the loss of polarity during chemotaxis 83 .
 The recognition of viruses or self nucleic acids by pDCs is mainly mediated by TLR7 and TLR9, which are located in endosomal compartments. Activation of these receptors in pDCs results in secretion of type I IFNs via the MyD88-IRF7 pathway as well as production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines via the MyD88-NF-κB pathway (reviewed in [6] [7] [8] Whether engagement of TLR7 or TLR9 results in the production of type I IFN or proinflammatory cytokines depends on the type of compartment in which these TLRs encounter their ligands ( Figure 4 ) 93, 94 . Multimeric CpG-A oligonucleotides aggregate in early endosomes where they activate the MyD88-IRF7 pathway that induces type I IFNs. In contrast, monomeric CpG-B is transferred to an endolysosomal compartment, where it activates the MyD88-NF-κB pathway that triggers expression of costimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. IkappaB kinase-alpha (IKKα) 95 , osteopontin 96 and mTOR 97 are key components of the MyD88-IRF7 signaling pathway, while IRF5 is essential for MyD88-NF-κB signaling 98, 99 . Trafficking of TLR9 to the subcellular compartment for type I IFN production is dependent on adapter protein 3 (AP3), as virus-or CpG-induced type I IFN expression is abolished in the absence of AP3 100, 101 . Forward genetic approaches have further identified Slc15a4, which encodes the peptide/histidine transporter 1 (PHT1), and BLOC1 and BLOC2 Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome proteins as key components required for TLR9 signaling in pDCs but not in other cell types 101 . However, TLR9-mediated recognition of large DNA-containing immune complexes is independent of AP3 102 and requires the convergence of phagocytic and autophagic pathways. This process is called microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)associated phagocytosis (LAP) and involves autophagy-related proteins but not the conventional autophagic pre-initiation complex. Recognition of live, single stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses by TLR7 in pDCs also occurs in a distinct subcellular compartment that requires transport of cytosolic viral replication intermediates into the lysosome by autophagy 103 .
 Several additional molecules involved in TLR7/9 signaling have been identified in pDCs. The scavenger receptor SCARB2/LIMP-2 is highly expressed in pDCs and regulates TLR9dependent type I IFN production by mediating TLR9 endosomal translocation and IRF7 nuclear translocation 104 . Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is a TLR9-interacting protein that regulates TLR9 trafficking to endosomal compartments and type I IFN production in pDCs 105 . PACSIN1 is an endocytic adapter specifically expressed in mouse and human pDCs that is essential for TLR9-induced type I IFN secretion but not pro-inflammatory cytokine production 54, 106 . VIPERIN is an IFN-inducible antiviral protein that promotes TLR7 and TLR9 signaling in pDCs by recruiting IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) to lipid bodies and inducing nuclear translocation of IRF7 107 . In addition to having a role in pDC migration, DOCK2 is essential for TLR7-and TLR9-mediated type I IFN production in pDCs, most likely because of its influence on actin cytoskeleton and vesicular trafficking 108 . In the absence of DOCK2, phosphorylation of IKKα and nuclear translocation of IRF7 are impaired in pDCs, but the capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines is maintained. TLR9, but not TLR7, signaling is also dependent on Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) 109 . Blocking BTK inhibits all TLR9-induced responses in pDCs, including cytokine production and expression of costimulatory molecules. Additional studies are required to provide an integrated view of how all these molecules coordinate the trafficking and signaling properties of TLR7/9containing vesicles in pDCs.
 Although TLR7 and TLR9 are important for pDC detection of viruses and self nucleic acids, recent evidence indicates that mouse pDCs also express TLR12 and TLR2, which permit detection of Toxoplasma gondii profilin 110 and bacterial polysaccharide A (PSA) 111 , respectively. Although TLR11 and TLR12 can both recognize profilin, TLR12 is sufficient for profilin detection in pDCs and triggers the production of IL-12 and type I IFNs, which activate NK cells 110 . Furthermore, in contrast to Tlr11 −/− mice, Tlr12 −/− mice are highly susceptible to T. gondii infection, which suggests a critical role for pDCs in the induction of the innate immune response and host resistance. PSA is an immunomodulatory molecule expressed by the ubiquitous gut microorganism Bacteriodes fragilis 112 . pDCs exposed to PSA via TLR2 express MHC class II, inducible costimulatory ligand (ICOSL) as well as CD86, and stimulate IL-10 production by CD4 + T cells, all of which are required for protection against colitis 111 .
 Although TLRs have been established as the main innate receptors involved in pDC activation, the impact of cytosolic nucleic acid sensors on type I IFN or pro-inflammatory cytokine production by pDCs has just begun to be explored. CpG-A oligonucleotides selectively bind to the DExD/H-box helicase 36 (DHX36) and this is associated with the nuclear translocation of IRF7 and type I IFN production in pDCs 113 . By contrast, CpG-B oligonucleotides are bound by DHX9, and this results in NF-κB activation and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in pDCs. Additionally, in the absence of type I IFN signaling, viruses can replicate in pDCs, producing viral nucleic acid that can be detected in a RIG-I-like helicase-dependent manner 85 . Major cytosolic sensors of nucleic acids, such as cGAS and STING 114 , are likely to be investigated in pDCs in the near future as well.
 Human and mouse pDCs express cell surface receptors that control the amplitude of type I IFN production and pDC activation state in response to TLR7 or TLR9 ligands 115 . Many of these receptors either contain intracellular tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) or they deliver intracellular signals through an associated adaptor, usually DNAX activation protein 12 (DAP12) or the γ chain of Fc receptors (FcRγ), which have an intracellular tyrosinebased activation motif (ITAM 
 MicroRNAs and hormones can also impact TLR7 and TLR9 signaling and pDC functions. Expression of miR-146a is induced upon engagement of TLR7 and TLR9, and this suppresses NF-κB activation and TLR-mediated signaling in pDCs 128 . miR-155 and its starform partner miR-155* are expressed in pDCs after TLR7 signaling and have opposing effects on type I IFN production 129 . Shortly after TLR7 stimulation, miR-155* is induced and augments type I IFN expression by inhibiting IRAKM, whereas miR-155 induction occurs later and shuts down type I IFN production by targeting TAB2. miR-126 has a prominent role in promoting the survival and function of pDCs 130 . miR-126 targets the mTOR pathway and regulates the expression of genes including Tlr7, Tlr9, Nfkb1 and Kdr, which encodes the growth factor receptor VEGFR2. pDC homeostasis and the capacity to respond to TLR ligands are impaired in both miR-126 −/− and Kdr −/− mice, indicating a role for VEGFR2 in supporting type I IFN production 130 .
 Recently, it was shown that TLR7-mediated signaling in pDCs is enhanced by estrogen 131 .
 Notably, this would provide a mechanistic basis for the observation that pDCs from women produce more type I IFN in response to HIV than pDCs from men 132 .
 Because pDCs express MHC class II molecules as well as the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86, they can present antigens to CD4 + T cells, albeit not as efficiently as cDCs (reviewed in 133, 134 ) . Antigen presentation by pDCs can lead to CD4 + T cell activation or tolerance induction, depending on the context (Figure 1 ). When pDCs receive activation signals through TLRs or other pattern recognition receptors, they act as immunogenic cells. When pDCs are either unstimulated or alternatively activated such that they express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) [135] [136] [137] [138] , ICOSL 139 , OX40L 140 , programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) 141 and/or granzyme B 142 , they promote tolerance to tumor cells, alloantigens and harmless antigens. Recent studies have proposed that pDCs that capture antigens in peripheral tissues utilize CCR9 to migrate to the thymus, where they induce deletion of antigen-specific thymocytes, thus contributing to immune tolerance 77 . It has also been reported that CCR9 + pDCs are potent inducers of regulatory T (T Reg ) cell function and can inhibit acute graft-versus-host disease induced by allogeneic CD4 + donor T cells in irradiated recipients 143 . This study defined pDCs as being either B220 + CD11c + CCR9 + or B220 + CD11c + CCR9 − , the former being the tolerogenic subset; however, a later study argued that B220 + CD11c + CCR9 − cells are not a subset of pDCs, but rather precursors of lymphoid tissue-resident cDCs 144 . In a mouse model of lung inflammation, adoptive transfer of CD8α + pDCs suppressed the development of airway hyper-reactivity by inducing T Reg cells 145 ; however, it has been reported that CD8 subunit expression by mouse pDCs is variable and does not define stable subsets 146 . Corroborating this, earlier studies found that CD8α is expressed by a fraction of pDCs in the steady-state but is induced on the majority of pDCs after activation 9, 147 . Thus, the role of pDC subsets in tolerance remains to be further explored.
 To selectively examine pDC antigen presentation capacity, antigens have been specifically targeted to pDCs by conjugating them to antibodies specific for pDC cell surface molecules.
 A recent study found that targeting antigens to BDCA2 promotes immunological tolerance by suppressing antigen-specific CD4 + T cell and antibody responses upon secondary exposure to antigen in the presence of adjuvant, a process that involves both preservation of TReg cells and a decrease in effector CD4 + T cells 148 . Antigens targeted to pDCs through DCIR are also presented to T cells 120 . In mice, it was shown that targeting a T cell epitope derived from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) to pDCs via SIGLEC-H delays onset and decreases disease severity in a model of MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by reducing the expansion and polarization of Th1 and Th17 cell populations 149 . In contrast, antigen delivery to pDCs via BST2 in combination with TLR agonists generates robust cellular and humoral immunity and protects mice against subsequent viral infection or tumor growth 150 . Thus, targeting antigen to pDCs can either promote or inhibit antigen-specific immune responses, depending on the antigen formulation and mode of stimulation or delivery.
 While in mouse models, pDCs have been mostly studied for their impact on antigen presentation to CD4 + T cells, human studies have focused on pDC antigen presentation to CD8 + T cells 151, 152 . Human pDCs have recycling endosomes in which peptides can be continuously loaded on to MHC class I molecules, which enables efficient presentation of viral antigens to CD8 + T cells 153 . Through this mechanism, pDCs may contribute to adaptive responses during viral infections. 155 . Only in the case of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and HSV-2 infections has pDC-derived type I IFN been shown to be critical for viral control in mice, reducing both morbidity and mortality [156] [157] [158] . A recent study found that individuals carrying inactivating mutations in the IRF7 gene have a severe defect in pDC function and are selectively susceptible to influenza virus infections 159 . It remains to be determined whether the pDC defect is sufficient to cause susceptibility to influenza or if IRF7 has a more general impact on the capacity of all cells to respond to the virus. Paradoxically, pDC responses to acute viral infections may not always be beneficial. Recent evidence indicates that excessive production of type I IFNs, probably by pDCs, during influenza virus infection in 129 mice can result in uncontrolled inflammation and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis of bronchial epithelium 160 . Thus, the impact of pDCs on acute viral infections may vary considerably depending on the virus, route of infection and genetic background.
 The role of pDCs in chronic viral infections, such as HIV-1, is even more complex, involving pDC activation, trafficking, type I IFN production and interaction with CD4 + T cells (reviewed in 161 ). HIV induces pDC activation through TLR7 but can also directly infect pDCs as they express CD4, CXCR4 and CCR5, which are co-receptors for viral entry.
 HIV promotes pDC trafficking to peripheral lymph nodes, and this is reflected by the reduced numbers of pDCs found in the blood of patients with HIV 161 . Moreover, new evidence indicates that pDCs upregulate the gut-homing markers α4β7 and CD103 and accumulate in the gut mucosa during SIV and HIV infections 162, 163 . Interestingly, pDCs from elite controllers also maintain a gut-homing phenotype, suggesting that gut trafficking of pDCs is independent of viral load 164 .
 pDCs may contribute to the chronicity of HIV infection through dysregulated activation and type I IFN production (reviewed in 165 ). HIV-stimulated pDCs express low levels of maturation molecules, induce weak T cell responses and persistently secrete type I IFNs, due to HIV trafficking to early endosomes 166 . In addition, HIV-stimulated pDCs produce chemokines and express TRAIL, thereby promoting recruitment and apoptosis of T cells.
 HIV can also activate the noncanonical NF-κB pathway in pDCs, resulting in the expression of IDO and induction of TReg cells 167 . Noncanonical NF-κB signaling and induction of a tolerogenic pathway in pDCs stimulated with high doses of CpG has also been reported 168 . Studies in humanized mice have shown that depletion of pDCs prior to or during chronic HIV-1 infection severely reduces type I IFN production and increases viral replication 169 . However, HIV-1-induced CD4 + T cell death is curbed despite elevated viral loads, suggesting that pDCs suppress HIV-1 replication but also contribute to HIV-1 immunopathogenesis. Conversely, studies in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection have provided a different view. Blockade of TLR7-and TLR9-mediated IFN-α production by pDCs did not diminish immune activation during SIV infection 170 , suggesting that other sources of type I IFN may contribute to immunopathology.
 The beneficial or detrimental effects of pDCs and type I IFNs in chronic viral infections may also depend on the timing of their action. During SIV infection, the timing of type I IFN production has a marked effect on the disease course 171 . Exogenous administration of IFN-α2a early on augments expression of antiviral genes and prevents systemic infection;
 however, sustained IFN-α2a treatment induces type I IFN desensitization, decreases antiviral gene expression, increases viral load and accelerates CD4 + T cell loss. In mouse, constitutive absence of pDCs or loss of their ability to signal through TLR7 and TLR9 in chronic LCMV infection appears to negatively impact T cell priming and viral clearance 157, 172 . Moreover, early administration of exogenous type I IFN prevents chronic LCMV infection. However, late type I IFN administration has no beneficial effects 173 . In fact, blockade of type I IFN signaling during chronic LCMV infection improves T cell function and diminishes viral persistence 174, 175 . Thus, there is a window of opportunity -i.e. early during infection -when type I IFNs and pDCs can be both beneficial and necessary to prevent or control chronic viral infection and preserve T cell numbers and functions. Sustained activation of pDCs is also detrimental in SLE because it results in the resistance of pDCs to therapeutic glucocorticoids (GC), which are often administered to patients with SLE to control inflammation 182, 183 . Bioinformatics and functional analyses have suggested that TLR activation prevents GC-induced pDC apoptosis by inhibiting miR-29b and miR-29c, which promote pDC apoptosis by targeting MCL1 and BCL2 184 . Endogenous GC also have an impact on pDC homeostasis and survival 185 . Regulation of endogenous GC concentrations involves conversion of inactive substrates to active 11hydroxyglucocorticoids by an enzyme complex containing 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD1) and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH). Under physiologic conditions, 11βHSD1-H6PDH increases the sensitivity of pDCs to GC-induced apoptosis; however, following activation with TLR ligands, the effects of enzyme activity are overridden. Genetic models that specifically address the contribution of pDCs in autoimmunity have been lacking until recently. Deletion of Irf8 in NZB mice and a mutation in Slc15a4 in C57BL/6.Fas lpr mice abolish production of autoantibodies and disease manifestations 188 .
 While this study provides compelling evidence that pDCs and their TLR7/TLR9-mediated responses are damaging in SLE, IRF8 and SLC15A4 are not exclusively expressed by pDCs.
 In fact, B cell expression of SLC15A4 appears to be necessary for TLR7-induced expression of type I IFN and pathogenic antibody production in a mouse model of lupus 189 . Analysis of MRL.Fas lpr mice lacking MyD88 showed that MyD88-dependent production of IFN-α by pDCs contributes to SLE pathogenesis, particularly B lymphopenia, but not to nephritis 190 . Two recent studies using lupus-prone mice that specifically lack pDCs have confirmed that pDCs are pathogenic in SLE. Global or CD11c-specific Tcf4 haplodeficiency in lupus-prone mice nearly abolishes autoantibody production and glomerulonephritis 191 , whereas transient depletion of pDCs prior to disease initiation in BXSB mice impairs expansion and activation of B and T cells and reduces antinuclear antibodies and expression of type I IFN-induced genes in tissues 192 . Taken together, these studies validate pDCs as a therapeutic target in SLE.
 Chronic activation of pDCs and dysregulated type I IFN production also appear to be contributing factors in initiating and/or promoting psoriasis and type I diabetes (T1D). In psoriasis, self nucleic acids form complexes with antimicrobial peptides which activate pDCs through TLR7 and TLR9 [193] [194] [195] . Interestingly, the Vitamin D analogue calcipotriol, which is used to treat psoriatic skin lesions, triggers tolerogenic responses in cDCs and was recently shown to impair the capacity of both human and mouse pDCs to induce T cell proliferation and effector T cell differentiation 196 . In the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D, activated B-1a cells produce DNA-reactive antibodies that stimulate release of cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) from neutrophils; CRAMP subsequently binds to self DNA and activates pDCs through TLR9 197 .
 The deleterious role(s) of pDCs in psoriasis and T1D have not been confirmed yet in genetic models, but blockade of type I IFN or antibody-mediated depletion of pDCs appears to confer protection in mouse models of these diseases [197] [198] [199] . Future studies will be necessary to address whether either blockade of type I IFN or depletion of pDCs are potential therapeutic avenues for intervention in psoriasis and T1D in human.
 As mucosal immunity and microbiome research is rapidly progressing, pDCs that reside within gut and gut-associated lymphoid tissues are also becoming the focus of increasing interest. In the TNBS-induced colitis model, PSA-induced protection is highly dependent on the ability of pDCs to induce the generation of IL-10-producing T Reg cells 111 . pDCs from the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes are also important for suppression of T cell responses and induction of oral tolerance 200 . In contrast to splenic pDCs, pDCs from Peyer's patches are unable to produce type I IFN after TLR7 or TLR9 stimulation 201 . pDCs that have been developed in the presence of type I IFN resemble Peyer's patch pDCs, produce inflammatory cytokines, stimulate Th17 cell generation and fail to secrete IFNα after TLR engagement 202 . Therefore, factors expressed at mucosal sites inhibit type I IFN secretion by pDCs, but do not block the ability of pDCs to prime naïve T cells and trigger T Reg and Th17 differentiation 203, 204 .
 Gut-associated pDCs are also efficient at generating mucosal B cell responses under normal conditions and during infection with a gut-tropic virus. In the steady-state, pDCs from Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes induce T cell-independent IgA production 205 . Specifically, the microbiota activates stromal cells to produce type I IFN, which drives pDC expression of BAFF and APRIL that facilitate IgA responses in the gut. Viral clearance and protection against reinfection with rotavirus, an intestinal pathogen, is highly dependent on B cells 206 . Type I IFN production by human and mouse pDCs exposed to rotavirus appears to be necessary for B cell activation, virus-specific antibody secretion and viral clearance during infection 206 . How the microbiota influences pDC functions is largely unknown, but an earlier study found that colonization of the intestine with a restricted microflora resulted in lysis of pDCs by activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes 207 . Therefore, specific microbial communities are likely to have a profound impact on pDC homeostasis and function through both direct and indirect mechanisms.
 Although many immune functions of pDCs have now been described, many questions still remain concerning their complex biology. Tuberculosis in humans is associated with a type I IFN signature 208 and pDC accumulation in lymph nodes 209 . So what is the role of pDCs in tuberculosis and in bacterial infections in general? Can bacterial products activate pDCs and what are the sensors for these products? Although pDCs accumulate in the microenvironment of some tumors, they are reduced in other cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 210 . What is the impact of pDCs in anti-tumor immune responses and can we exploit them to generate effective T cell responses (Box 3)?
 The recruitment of pDCs to tumors is often associated with poor prognosis as tumorinfiltrating pDCs tend to be tolerogenic rather than immunogenic. Unstimulated or alternatively activated pDCs can induce T Reg cells through expression of IDO [135] [136] [137] [138] or ICOSL 139 . The accumulation of IDO-expressing cells in tumor draining lymph nodes has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with malignant tumors including breast carcinoma 137 . The infiltration of pDCs in primary tumors of patients with invasive nonmetastatic breast cancer correlates with shorter survival times, suggesting that pDCs contribute to the progression of breast cancer 237 . Breast tumor-associated pDCs are poor producers of type I IFN and favor the expansion of T Reg cells 238 . The mechanisms suppressing type I IFN production and immunogenic capacity of breast tumor infiltrating pDCs include tumor cell-derived TGF-β and TNF-α 239 , both TGF-β and TNF-α inhibit type I IFN secretion by pDCs 201, 240 . ICOSL expression on pDCs also appears to correlate with breast cancer progression by supporting amplification of IL-10 producing T Reg cells 241 .
 Recruitment of pDCs to ovarian tumors is driven by CXCL12 and is associated with impaired T cell responses and poor prognosis 72,242 . Compared to pDCs in blood or ascites, ovarian tumor-associated pDCs produce less type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in response to TLR stimulation and induce IL-10 production from allogeneic naive CD4 + T cells, suggesting that they play a critical role in the induction of immune tolerance and progression of ovarian cancer 243 .
 Human pDCs may also contribute to cancer progression via the production and release of the pro-apoptotic molecule granzyme B 12 , which suppresses T cell proliferation. Activation of pDCs through TLR agonists and CD40 ligand negatively regulates granzyme B expression and the ability of pDCs to suppress T cells 142 . In contrast to NK cells, pDCs do not release the pore-forming protein perforin, and therefore are unable to kill tumor target cells by release of lytic granules.
 On the other hand, pDCs can promote immunogenic anti-tumor responses if appropriately stimulated. Injection of activated pDCs loaded with tumor-associated peptides into metastatic melanoma patients leads to favorable CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, indicating that vaccination strategies employing activated pDCs might be an attractive therapeutic strategy to overcome immune tolerance in certain types of cancer 244 . In an orthotopic murine mammary tumor model, intratumoral administration of a TLR7 ligand results in tumor-associated pDC activation and has a potent anti-tumor effect 245 . In the B16 melanoma mouse model, TLR-stimulated pDCs mediate tumor killing through expression of TRAIL and granzyme B 75 as well as through the activation of NK cells 246 . The ability of pDCs to produce cytolytic mediators and the functional relevance of this capacity in the elimination of target cells and immune regulation has been extensively debated; however, it has been shown that the FSME-IMMUN vaccine against tick-borne encephalitis stimulates pDCs to upregulate neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1, also known as CD56) and TRAIL expression, thereby generating a subset of pDCs that combines the abilities of interferon production and antigen presentation with that of lysing target cells 247 . CD56 expression is also typical of several neoplastic human pDC tumors 248 .
 Although SLE is generally associated with a type I IFN signature, it has been recently shown that pDC production of type I IFN is impaired in patients carrying a variant of the PTPN22 gene predisposing to SLE 211 . This observation raises the question of whether pDC and type I IFN depletion is a valid strategy for all SLE patients or should be adopted after stratification of the patients for pDC activity. Recent studies suggest that pDC dysfunction in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases may extend to scleroderma 212 , Sjögren syndrome 213 , Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome 214 and atherosclerosis 215 . Is there a role for pDCs in other inflammatory diseases such as IBD? Is manipulation or elimination of pDCs a feasible therapeutic strategy for some of these diseases? Whether pDCs are valid targets during viral infections remains a matter of debate. While pDC activation may be beneficial at early stages of infection, depletion of pDCs may be considered during chronic viral infections, such as HIV, when type I IFN may exert negative effects.
 Addressing these and other questions in mouse models will require advanced tools to deplete pDCs in vivo. The development of CLEC4C-DTR transgenic mice has provided a method for specific but transient pDC depletion 216 . Conditional targeting of E2-2 in CD11c + cells has enabled constitutive depletion of pDCs 157 , although CX3CR1 + CD8α + DCs 49 , which are closely related to pDCs, and possibly B cell subsets expressing CD11c may also be affected. It will be important to continue to identify pDC-specific genes that can be used for development of pDC lineage-specific deficient mice and pDC-specific Cre deleters. With the recognition of pDC involvement in human pathologies, it is predicted that these cells will be more extensively evaluated for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Indeed, it will be interesting to explore the therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies that selectively target pDCs in many of the disease scenarios discussed above.
 The less abundant of the two strands of microRNA (miRNA) that are generated during miRNA biogenesis. Star-form miRNAs may have important functions in miRNA regulatory networks noncanonical NF-κB pathway
 Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling that is induced by certain members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily and predominantly activates p52-RELB NF-κB complexes. By contrast, canonical (or classical) NF-κB signaling typically involves the activation of p50-RELA dimers and is induced by a wider range of pro-inflammatory stimuli The development of pDCs from CDPs is regulated by specific cytokines and transcription factors. FLT3L-STAT3 signaling promotes expression of E2-2, which is the master transcription factor required for pDC development. The absence of E2-2 or its deletion in mature pDCs results in the complete loss of pDCs or the differentiation of pDC-committed cells into cDC-like cells, respectively. In contrast, GM-CSF-STAT5 signaling blocks pDC differentiation during DC development by inducing expression of ID2, which is an antagonist of E2-2. The transcriptional cofactor MTG16 promotes pDC differentiation and restricts cDC development in part by repressing ID2. Transcriptional targets of E2-2 encode proteins associated with pDC development, homeostasis and function. SPIB, BCL11A and IRF8 are necessary for pDC differentiation and/or survival while RUNX2 controls pDC homeostasis through expression of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5, which permit egress from the bone marrow. CIITA promotes MHC class II expression. BDCA2, ILT7 and SIGLEC-H are markers that are selectively expressed by human or mouse pDCs and are involved in regulation of type I IFN production. TLR7, TLR9 and PACSIN1 enable pDC recognition of nucleic acids and pathogens (i.e. RNA and DNA viruses), resulting in type I IFN secretion and/or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Swiecki pDCs express chemokine receptors and homing molecules that promote recruitment in the steady-state and during inflammation. Development of pDCs in bone marrow (BM) stromal cell niche requires CXCR4 expression, while pDC egress from the BM into the blood is dependent on CCR5 and CCR2. pDCs are attracted to tumors that produce CXCL12 (not shown) and the splenic white pulp via CXCR4. DOCK2, a hematopoietic cell-specific CDM family protein involved in CXCR4 signaling, is also necessary for pDC migration to spleen and lymph nodes (LNs). pDCs express CD62L, PSGL-1, β1/β2 integrins and the chemokine receptors CCR5, CXCR3 and CCR7 which mediate adhesion and chemotaxis to peripheral LNs and the splenic white pulp under normal and/or inflammatory conditions. Blood pDCs express the chemerin receptor, ChemR23, as well as A1-R, C3aR and C5aR, which may guide them to peripheral LNs and damaged tissues. CD2AP is an intracellular protein that regulates actin dynamics and promotes pDC migration to LNs under inflammatory settings. CCR2 drives the recruitment of pDCs to the skin following inflammation induced by the TLR7 agonist, Imiquimod. CCR6 and CCR10 are expressed by a subset of human tonsil pDCs and enable migration to inflamed epithelia producing CCL20 and CCL27 (not shown). CCR9 and its ligand CCL25 (not shown) promote trafficking of peripheral pDCs to the thymus and are required for pDC recruitment to the small intestine under both normal and inflammatory conditions. MAdCAM-1, β7 integrin and CD103 also influence pDC trafficking to the gut. Finally, pDCs express CX3CR1 (not shown), which may impact their homeostasis. pDCs sense DNA viruses, synthetic CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODN) and endogenous DNA through TLR9. All TLR9 signaling requires MyD88 but additional factors determine whether TLR9 engagement will result in type I IFN (IFN-I) or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. These factors include mode of ligand entry, and the intracellular compartment where TLR9 encounters its ligand. TLR9 is transported to appropriate intracellular compartments by UNC93B 249, 250 and requires cleavage in order to recruit MyD88 251, 252 . DNA viruses, CpG ODN and small DNA immunecomplexes (DNA-ICs) enter pDCs through endocytosis and meet TLR9 in the early endosome. In contrast, large DNA-ICs are internalized by phagocytosis and encounter TLR9 and UNC93B in the early phagosome. If AP3 or LC3 are recruited then the IRF7 endosome or IRF7 phagosome is formed which leads to IFN-I production. Several molecules/pathways are involved in this process including IKKα, osteopontin (OPN), SLC15A4, BTK, BLOC1, BLOC2, DOCK2, PACSIN1, PLSCR1, VIPERIN, SCARB2 and the mTOR pathway. Alternatively, TLR9containing compartments can form NF-κB endosomes or NF-κB phagosomes resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (i.e. IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α, etc). This process requires IRF5, BTK and SLC15A4. CpG ODN have different structures which results in trafficking to different compartments: CpG-A is transported to the IRF7 endosome and is a strong inducer of IFN-I, while CpG-B aggregates in the NF-κB endosome and is a potent stimulator of maturation and cytokine/chemokine production. CpG-C exhibits properties of both CpG-A and CpG-B in that it can induce both IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokines. TLR7 stimulation by viral and endogenous RNA may follow similar pathways.",528bfcf1a4b7b7f134a87bd9bb9c13ab47a0d363,2015-07-10,"Swiecki, Melissa; Colonna, Marco",Nature Reviews Immunology,10.1038/nri3865,Nature Reviews Immunology,351.0,True,"In rheumatoid arthritis, however, both inhibitory and promoting roles for NK cells have been reported 13, 14 . The distribution of NK cells is not static because these cells can recirculate between organs 15 . NK cells can be divided into functionally distinct subsets, which differ between humans and mice. Human NK cells can be functionally classified based on the levels of CD56 and CD16 expression. By contrast, CD56 hi CD16 − NK cells, which are the predominant NK cell subset in peripheral lymphoid organs, produce large amounts of cytokines -including interferon-γ(IFNγ), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)following stimulation by pro-inflammatory cytokines and acquire cytotoxicity only after prolonged activation 31, 32 . Mouse NK cells share many characteristics with human NK cells, but the lack of CD56 expression and other surface markers on mouse NK cells makes it difficult to identify functionally comparable NK cell populations in mice. Several subsets of ILCs are enriched in mucosal tissues, particularly in the gut. NK cells have a crucial role in antiviral immunity; LTi cells are important for the development of lymph nodes during embryogenesis, tissue remodelling, homeostasis of epithelia and host defence; and natural helper cells and nuocytes have been implicated in immunity to extracellular parasites and in the development of asthma. Cytotoxicity against infected or transformed cells and production of cytokines are the main effector functions of NK cells. The liver represents a unique immunological environment, in which constant exposure to gut-derived antigens does not result in inflammation. In mice, 5-10% of hepatic lymphocytes are NK cells, whereas, strikingly, up to 30-50% of all human hepatic lymphocytes are NK cells. Moreover, studies in mice have shown that the number of NK cells changes substantially in different experimental models of liver diseases. In support of this notion, splenic NK cells can migrate to the liver following adoptive transfer, where they adopt a phenotype and function that closely resembles that of liver-resident NK cells 44 . Memory NK cells specific for such antigens are enriched in the liver (FIG. In addition to its role in NK cell-mediated memory, tonic engagement of CXCR6 protects the liver from NK cell-mediated hepatotoxicity by regulating the killing activity of NK cells 50 . NK cells may assist in maintaining liver tolerance through their interactions with various cell types. Kupffer cells, which are mainly localized around the periportal regions in the liver, function as hepatic tissue macrophages and are crucial for endotoxin removal from the blood. 53 ), which induces expression of NKG2A 51 . The liver encounters relatively high levels of LPS derived from the gut, which could be potentially harmful. Chronic liver disease is often associated with the development of fibrosis, a wound-healing process. Transcriptional profiling studies using gene arrays identified TRAIL as one of the most significantly upregulated genes in NK cells after IFNα stimulation. IFNα-stimulated NK cells killed HCV-infected hepatoma cells in a TRAILdependent manner. However, during chronic liver infections, NK cells promote the persistence of the pathogen and liver injury while inhibiting liver fibrosis and tissue regeneration. Interpretation of studies performed with NK cells in mucosal tissues is complicated by the fact that many studies often have not been able to distinguish bona fide NK cells from NKT cells and the growing population of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that are particularly prevalent in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)
 . Nevertheless, based on the available evidence, NK cells represent a major lymphocyte subset in the healthy lung (accounting for ~10% of all lymphocytes in the lung in mice) 16 , and are also present in healthy skin in humans 62 and in the GALT of humans and mice 65 . In humans, infection with Staphylococcus aureus triggers a vigorous NK cell influx into the broncho-alveolar space 64 . Specifically, lung NK cells express multiple LY49 receptors, whereas most NK cells that develop from bone marrow-derived progenitors express CD94-NKG2 heterodimers but not LY49, suggesting a major impact of the microenvironment on NK cell development 66 . During S. aureus infection, lung NK cells produce increased amounts of TNF 64 . IFNγ production peaks at 48 hours postinoculation in this model. Importantly, this study also showed that mothers with uterine NK cells that express activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors with similar specificities are less likely to suffer from unsuccessful pregnancy. In summary, uterine NK cells can either develop in situ or migrate to the decidua after being attracted by locally produced chemokines. This indicates that NK cells can be recruited to the pancreas in the absence of profound inflammation. NK cells might be recruited to the pancreas by chemokines such as CXCL10 (a ligand for CXCR3 on NK cells) and CCL5 (a ligand for CCR5 on NK cells), which can be produced by multiple cell types, including pancreatic β-cells (TABLE 1) , and their numbers are increased in the pancreas of NOD mice in an accelerated model of T1D 86 . Molecular, phenotypic and functional characteristics of NK cells in the pancreas and spleen have been compared between diabetes-prone NOD mice and diabetes-resistant mice 5, 85 . The phenotype of NK cells in the pancreas might be influenced by cytokines produced by other cell types. There is also evidence that NK cell functions are kept in check by T Reg cells, as ablation of CD4 + FOXP3 + T Reg cells in diabetes-prone BDC2.5 T cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic NOD mice results in rapid activation of NK cells within the insulitic lesions, before the activation of effector T cells 6 . Chemokine ligands for these receptors have been detected in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis 94 (TABLE 1) . NK cells in the inflamed joint that express RANKL and M-CSF are frequently juxtaposed with monocytes in the synovium of inflamed joints 13 (TABLE 2) . These factors, in particular IL-15, might also contribute to the induction of RANKL and M-CSF in synovial NK cells 13 . These observations suggest opposite functions of NK cells in lymph nodes versus inflamed joints during rheumatoid arthritis. The current available information is not sufficient to provide a clear linkage between the divergent phenotypes and functions of NK cells in lymphoid organs and joints. In the CNS, the brain and spinal cord are shielded from the circulating blood by the bloodbrain barrier and the epithelial blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, respectively, which are formed by the tight junctions of endothelial cells and prevent the influx of immune cells under normal physiological conditions. However, it remains unclear which NK cell subset executed this killing activity and how microglia were maintained within a resting state during this experiment. Under pathophysiological conditions, an array of soluble factors is produced by microglia, astrocytes and neuronal cells (FIG. Thus, there is strong evidence that CNS-specific NK cells control CNS inflammation during EAE in mice. These findings might be relevant to the mode of action of daclizumab, a humanized antibody specific for the IL-2 receptor α-chain (CD25). Although the exact cellular and molecular interactions that shape NK cell phenotype and function in the CNS still need to be determined, it appears that activated NK cells have a protective role in the brain under the circumstances of ongoing inflammation, as they eliminate viral infection and inhibit the activation of autoimmune T cells through the killing of activated microglia. In doing so, NK cells may kill infected or transformed cells. When this process becomes dysregulated, damage to neighbouring cells and autoimmune disease might ensue. Furthermore, the studies discussed here raise the possibility that organ-specific factors shape NK cell phenotype and contribute to the organspecific functions of these cells. Additional determinants include inciting pathogens or autoantigens that induce inflammation. There are many outstanding questions and future challenges in this area (BOX 2) . Progress will be facilitated by novel approaches such as two-photon microscopy, which has been used to record the trafficking of several types of lymphocytes to reveal the cellular interactions within solid organs in physiological and pathological situations [119] [120] [121] [122] . The application of this and other techniques to studies of NK cells in solid organs should reveal valuable information on the physical localization of NK cells within specific anatomical structures, as well as interactions with resident cellular components. Imaging studies in live animals may yield insight into the behaviour of NK cells during the course of organ-specific inflammation. • How are the local effects of NK cells affected by tissue-specific MHC class I expression? How are these processes affected by local inflammatory responses and the influx of additional inflammatory cells that may alter tissue MHC class I expression levels? Improved access to human organs will also be paramount. Once we understand these mechanisms, the next challenge will be to exploit this information to harness NK cells for combating infectious agents and tumours and for avoiding autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Cytotoxic lymphocytes of the innate immune system. Human NK cells express the surface marker CD56, and mouse NK cells express the surface markers DX5 (CD49b) and, in some mouse strains (for example, C57BL/ 6), NK1.1 (CD161)
 A form of diabetes caused by autoimmune destruction of insulinproducing pancreatic β-cells. Autoimmune destruction is predominantly mediated by CD8 + T cells, but natural killer cells may affect disease outcome
 A systemic inflammatory disorder that may affect many tissues and organs, but principally attacks synovial joints. The pathology of the disease process often leads to the destruction of articular cartilage and ankylosis of the joints Hepatic NK cells face the challenging task of balancing immunity to multiple hepatotropic viruses and bacteria with tolerance to food and self antigens. IL-10 in turn renders NK cells hyporesponsive to IL-12 and IL-18 and promotes tolerance in the liver. Activated hepatic NK cells can lyse hepatocytes or stellate cells via TRAIL-dependent pathways during hepatitis B virus infection or fibrosis, respectively. Thus, Kupffer cells appear to have a dual role in shaping hepatic NK cell phenotype and function. Hepatic NK cells are also subjected to the influence of interferon-γ (IFNγ) released by natural killer T (NKT) cells. CCR, CC-chemokine receptor; CXCR, CXC-chemokine receptor; S1PR, S1P receptor. The entry of lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS) is normally shielded by the blood-brain barrier, which becomes compromised in several pathological circumstances. Brain-specific cell types and neurotransmitters alter the features of NK cells that migrate from the periphery. An array of cytokines, growth factors and neurotransmitters produced by microglial cells, astrocytes and neurons can influence NK cell activation and proliferation.

56,56,40c239fc6881ef05629eaa6da85a343a23614a72,,Identification of Viral Pathogen Diversity in Sewage Sludge by Metagenome Analysis,"The large diversity of viruses that exist in human populations are potentially excreted into sewage collection systems and concentrated in sewage sludge. In the US, the primary fate of processed sewage sludge (class B biosolids) is application to agricultural land as a soil amendment. To characterize and understand infectious risks associated with land application, and to describe the diversity of viruses in human populations, shotgun viral metagenomics was applied to 10 sewage sludge samples from 5 wastewater treatment plants throughout the continental U.S, each serving between 100,000 and 1,000,000 people. Nearly 330 million DNA sequences were produced and assembled, and annotation resulted in identifying 43 (26 DNA, 17 RNA) different types of human viruses in sewage sludge. Novel insights include the high abundance of newly emerging viruses (e.g. Coronavirus HKU1, Klassevirus, and Cosavirus) the strong representation of respiratory viruses, and the relatively minor abundance and occurrence of Enteroviruses. Viral metagenome sequence annotations were reproducible and independent PCR-based identification of selected viruses suggests that viral metagenomes were a conservative estimate of the true viral occurrence and diversity. These results represent the most complete description of human virus diversity in any wastewater sample to date, provide engineers and environmental scientists with critical information on important viral agents and routes of infection from exposure to wastewater and sewage sludge, and represent a significant leap forward in understanding the pathogen content of class B biosolids.","Despite the important global public health burden of environmental viral infections, methods have not been fully developed and applied for describing the broad diversity of human viruses in environmental samples. Over 140 different viral pathogen genotypes have the potential to exist in the environment 1 , and new pathogenic strains and species continue to be discovered 2 . Each viral type has unique infectious, structural, environmental transport, and environmental survival characteristics. Due in large part to culturability limitations and cost associated with identifying and quantifying human viruses through culture-based methods, environmental regulations and monitoring schemes typically focus on bacterial indicators, such as fecal coliforms 3 .
 Shotgun metagenomic approaches enable simultaneous and target independent identification of viral pathogens, and provide a potential solution to the challenges associated with the traditionally culture-based methods for viral identification. By isolating virus-sized particles, extracting their nucleic acids, sequencing random short nucleic acid fragments, and assembling and classifying these short sequences, the full diversity of viral pathogens in an environmental sample can be revealed 4, 5 . Although the rapid reductions in the time and cost of DNA sequencing and the increasing set of sequenced genomes from human viral pathogens have enabled this metagenome approach for human viral pathogen detection [4] [5] [6] , viral metagenomic approaches have yet to be applied to highlight viral pathogen diversity, prevalence, and dominant genotypes in a large cross-section of environmental samples.
 Sewage sludge, the solid waste stream resulting from wastewater treatment, represents an ideal matrix with which to apply metagenomic viral pathogen detection technologies. Sewage sludge has a high potential for pathogen diversity due to its source of concentrated human waste from thousands to millions of humans, and all known viral pathogens can be excreted by humans in to wastewater collection systems. The ultimate fate of particleassociated viruses contained in raw sewage and secondary wastewater clarifiers is sewage sludge. In the U.S., the majority of biosolids (stabilized sewage sludge) are applied to agricultural land and approximately 75% of these are of class B status 7 . While class B biosolids are known to contain pathogens, the full pathogen content has not been fully described, especially for viruses 8, 9 . The independent identification of viral pathogen diversity in sewage sludge would represent a significant advance in the science of sewage sludge management. More broadly, viral pathogen diversity data can assist in making rational regulatory and treatment design decisions in a variety of environmental scenarios including the assessment of human exposure routes to viruses in wastewater effluents, transport of reclaimed wastewater viruses through the subsurface, wastewater source tracking, and tracking the efficacy of virus removal from a variety of water and wastewater treatment schemes, including point of use devices 10, 11 .
 We conducted a metagenomic analysis on ten sewage sludge samples (mesophilic anaerobic digester influent and effluent from five plants) collected from major wastewater treatment facilities located throughout the continental United States. DNA and RNA (cDNA) from virus-sized particles were isolated and sequenced using three separate runs of Illumina® HiSeq technology. These sequences were then quality trimmed, assembled, and annotated to identify the diversity of human DNA and RNA viruses in raw and stabilized sewage sludge. Replicated sample preparation and sequencing runs, and independent confirmation by polymerase chain reaction were employed to assess the quality of viral pathogen annotation. The ability to identify the full diversity of human viruses in environmental samples will assist in moving environmental science and engineering away from a strong reliance on indicator organisms, and closer to the analysis of the relevant infectious agents, thus enabling new approaches for determining the environmental fate of and exposure to viruses that are infectious to humans.
 Summaries of the materials and methods for sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction and sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses are provided below. In-depth details of these methods are provided in the Supporting Information.
 The influent and effluent sludge from mesophilic anaerobic digesters was sampled from five domestic wastewater treatment plants within the continental United States (one each from the Southwest, Southeast and Midwest, and two from the Northeast). All influent samples were mixtures of primary and secondary sludge. Effluent sewage sludge samples were of a class B product, prior to dewatering. Samples were shipped on ice and fecal coliform and coliphage analysis plus virus extraction was performed within 24 hours of sampling. The sampled treatment plants served populations between 100,000 and 1,000,000 residents and utilized activated sludge processes.
 Viruses were eluted from sewage sludge samples and then concentrated following a procedure adapted from Monpoeho and co-workers 12 (see Supporting Information for details). The viral particles were then purified and concentrated further by overnight polyethylene glycol 8000 (Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) precipitation. The final product was suspended in 12 ml of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 0.13M sodium chloride, 0.003M potassium chloride, and 0.01M phosphate, pH=7.3) (Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) and used for subsequent coliphage culturing and nucleic acid extraction.
 Somatic and male-specific coliphages in the samples were cultured using U.S. EPA method 1602 13 via the dual agar method (see Supporting Information for details). Fecal coliforms were enumerated by serial diluting sewage sludge in sterile PBS, spread plating on m-FC agar (BD Diagnostics, Maryland, USA), incubating at 44.5°C overnight, and visually enumerating colonies. Treatment plant digester characteristics and indicator organism concentrations are summarized in Table 1 .
 RNA and DNA were recovered from the viral concentrate using a Qiagen Viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, California, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. To obtain a sufficient quantity of DNA and reverse transcribed RNA (cDNA) for sequencing, it was necessary to amplify the viral nucleic acids using a random transcription/amplification protocol as previously described 6, 14 . This nucleic acid kit and amplification method have previously been recognized to extract and amplify both genomic RNA and DNA 5, 15 . Recovered DNA and cDNA was sent to the Yale University Center for Genome Analysis where the viral genomic DNA and cDNA were fragmented to ~200 bp (base pair) lengths and sequenced using the Illumina® HiSeq 2000 platform in three separate runs, generating both paired-end (2 runs) and single-end (1 run) 76 bp reads (see Supporting Information for details).
 The overall bioinformatic strategy included the following steps: (i) trim and clean sequencing reads, (ii) generate a master assembly of all sequence data, (iii) annotate the assembled contiguous sequences (contigs) through MG-RAST tBLASTx, and (iv) map sample specific reads onto the master assembly to determine sequence coverage (relative abundance). In total, 12 samples were sequenced; ten representing the influent (I) and effluent (E) of the five digesters (A, B, C, D, E) and an additional set of true biological replicates of the digester B samples (BI2 and BE2). Sequencing was also performed twice (technical replicates) for digesters B, C, D, and E. Biological replicates are defined as different nucleic acid extracts prepared from the same sample and viral elution. Technical replicates are defined as replicate sequencing runs from the same nucleic acid extracts. Short reads were assembled into contiguous sequences (contigs) and blasted against the NCBI viral genome database using tBLASTx with a maximum e-value of 0.001, which has previously been shown to minimize false negatives in metagenome annotation for human viral pathogen identification 4 . To determine sample-specific sequence presence and relative abundance, reads from each sample were mapped onto contigs generated from the master assembly. For each sample, this relative abundance is presented as the log 10 of reads mapped to a specific viral pathogen contig divided by the total reads in that sample. Assembled contigs are available via MG-RAST accession number 4497937.3.
 Finally, PCR of selected human viruses was used to validate metagenome annotation results. Viruses targeted by specific PCR primers (Table S1 ) included human strains of Adenovirus, Enterovirus, Parechovirus, and Norovirus GII. All PCR assays were performed on the nucleic acid extracts from the viral elution. The Supporting Information contains full details of the bioinformatic analysis and PCR validation experiments.
 Shotgun metagenome DNA and cDNA sequencing was done on three lanes of an Illumina® HiSeq 2000 generating 38.7 Gb (gigabases) of raw sequence data. Following trimming for quality scores, amplification adaptors, and read length, 21.6 Gb (~330 million reads) were used for assembling reads into contiguous sequences. The number of trimmed reads produced for each sample is summarized in Table S2 .
 The master assembly, which incorporated sequence reads from all samples, produced 412,654 contigs longer than 200 bp ( Figure S1 , Table S2 ). A contig length cutoff of 200 bp was chosen based on previous results 4 that indicated contigs shorter than 200 bp are subject to increased annotation error. For the master assembly, the N50 (median contig size) was 512 bp, N90 was 231 bp, and the total assembly size was 186,505,658 bp. A histogram of contig sizes is shown in Figure S1 .
 Master assembly contigs were annotated through a tBLASTx comparison with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) viral genome database. General annotation characteristics compiled by MG-RAST are shown in Figure 1A . Even though MG-RAST predicted that over 90% of all sequences coded for proteins, only 19.7% (81,265 contigs) had significant hits to known sequences in the MG RAST database ( Figure 1A ). The failure to annotate contigs demonstrates the limitations of viral diversity (especially for bacteriophages) represented in genome databases. Our experimental efforts to remove contaminating nucleic acids and also the low rRNA gene identifications in MG-RAST annotation ( Figure 1A ) suggest that contamination by non-viral nucleic acids was minimal. The majority of contigs annotated by tBLASTx searches ( Figure 1B) were bacteriophages, followed by non-human eukaryotic viruses. Human pathogens comprised 0.1% of all contigs.
 Of the 81,265 annotated contigs and 412,654 total contigs, 470 contigs (0.58% of annotated and 0.11% of total contigs) were tentatively identified as human viral pathogens. The N50 sequence length of these human pathogen contigs was 630 bp (Figure S1 inset) . The most abundant potential human pathogen, with the majority of annotated contigs, belonged to the taxonomic family Herpesvirus. Of the other viral pathogen annotations, 32 contigs were identified as DNA viruses of non-Herpesvirus origin (Table S3 ) and 25 contigs were identified as RNA human viral pathogens (Table S4) The relative abundances and occurrence of viral pathogens are presented in Figure 2 . The relative abundance of pathogen-annotated contigs in each specific sample represents the log 10 transformed number of reads within a sample that map to a specific pathogenannotated contig, normalized by the number of sequences in that sample. These values are not quantitative on an absolute (i.e. per mass) basis; thus, reliable estimates of pathogen removal through the digester cannot be performed. Figure 2 results demonstrate that the most abundant and ubiquitous viruses identified by metagenomics were the DNA viruses. Adenovirus, Herpesvirus, Papillomavirus, and Bocavirus were found in more than 90% of the samples. RNA viruses with occurrence greater than 80% of samples were Coronavirus, Klassevirus, and Rotavirus ( Figure 2 ). Relative abundance was linked with occurrence, with the most abundant regions the figure (darkest shade) corresponding to highest occurrence. Variations of up to four orders of magnitude in normalized relative abundance were also observed in pathogen annotations between samples. To observe variations between influent and effluent viral populations for the different locations, viral pathogen populations are presented in a principle coordinate analysis using the Sorensen similarity index (Figure 3 ) 16 . The Sorensen similarity index is a pair-wise measure of sample similarity based on presence-absence data. Using this method of visualization, the normalizing impact of treatment was apparent, as effluent samples grouped with each other and were distinct from the influent samples.
 Two types of reproducibility, biological (replicates starting from DNA and RNA extraction) and technical (sequencing replicates), were investigated. Graphical representations comparing the duplicate relative abundances of annotated viral contiguous sequences are shown in Figure 4 . It is both qualitatively and quantitatively evident from the scatter plots and line of best fit statistics that there is a high level of reproducibility (i.e. results are nonrandom) in metagenome annotation and sequencing. Technical reproducablity (average slope=0.90±0.03, average R 2 = 0.88±0.02) is higher (p<0.01) than biological reproducibility (average slope=0.79±0.2, average R 2 =0.62±0.07). Pathogen annotations for the true biological replicates were highly reproducible. Of the 40 virus data points presented in Figure 3 (see red box) for BI and BE, 37 agreed for presence and absence in the BI2 and BE2 samples.
 Additionally, PCR-based molecular assays were conducted for a suite of viruses that were expected to be present in the influent and effluent viral metagenomes. The results of these assays are presented in Table 2 and demonstrate the greater sensitivity of the targeted PCR methods. The sole DNA virus considered by targeted PCR, Adenovirus, was found in every sample by PCR and 92% of samples by metagenome annotation. Results for RNA viruses consistently showed higher occurrence by PCR than sequencing. Enteroviruses occurrence was 70% by PCR and 42% by sequence annotation (Coxsackievirus and Rhinovirus are included as Enterovirus), Parechoviruses occurrence of 100% by PCR and 58% by sequence annotation, and Norovirus GII occurrence of 80% by PCR, while not being identified by metagenome sequencing.
 Two important, novel contributions can be drawn from this work's results. The first is the broad diversity of human viruses revealed in the sludge samples. In every sample surveyed, the degree of viral pathogen diversity is greater than had been previously demonstrated in any environmental or wastewater sample. The realistic implications of this diversity include the need to consider a broader selection of viruses in environmental fate and transport studies, and importance of considering multiple human exposure routes to sewage sludge and wastewater. For the second major contribution, this work demonstrates the utility of metagenomic approaches for viral pathogen identification. Metagenome results are highly reproducible, and verification of pathogen identifications highlights the conservative nature of metagenomic pathogen identifications.
 DNA viruses causing latent infections, namely Herpesvirus and Papillomavirus, were the most ubiquitous and abundant viruses identified. Both viruses are highly prevalent in the general population. Papillomavirus infection has been previously documented in 68% of women (female-only cohort) 17 , and seroprevalence rates have been estimated at 85% for human Herpesvirus 6A and 6B 18 . This high prevalence coupled to the elevated relative abundances and 100% occurrence in the 12 influent and effluent samples considered here also demonstrate the potential for these viruses to be used as indicator or source tracking organisms for human waste. However, due to the presence of conserved genes between Herpesvirus and the human genome 19 , it has previously been recognized that Herpesvius will require additional confirmation before these applications can be developed 20 .
 Beyond viruses causing latent infections, high occurrence and abundances were also observed for viruses associated with respiratory disease. Adenoviruses were highly occurring and abundant in samples considered in this study and were dominated type B and C respiratory strains, consistent with recent reports of Adenovrius diversity in sewage sludge 21 . By qPCR, Adenovirus has been observed at concentrations of 10 4 to 10 6 genome copies per dry gram in class B biosolids 22 . Bocavirus is frequently the cause of respiratory disease in children, has been recently detected in raw wastewater and occurred in 90% of the samples considered in this study 23 . The second most prevalent RNA virus was Coronavirus HKU1, a recently described agent associated with acute respiratory infections 24 . While the traditional concern with wastewater exposure has been ingestion, viruses that result in respiratory infections or are transmitted by the airborne route, droplet nuclei, or by fomite (Rhinovirus C, Bocavirus, Rubella virus, Coxsackievirus A16, Coronavirus HKU1, and respiratory Adenovirus B and C, and Parechovirus) were more abundant and prevalent than those which are transmitted by ingestion and result in gastrointestinal infection (Parvovirus, Rotavirus, Astrovirus, Sappovirus, Aichi virus, Parechovirus, and Adenovirus F). This load of respiratory viruses suggests the need for a broader view of human disease transmission modes due to wastewater exposure, and supports the concern over exposure to aerosols emitted during the land application of class B biosolids 22, 25 .
 Among the most widely occurring and abundant RNA viruses were the emerging Picornaviruses including Parechovirus, Klassevirus and Cosavirus. Studies suggest Parechovirus seroprevalence in adults to be as high as 95%, and Parechoviruses are associated with both gastrointestinal and respiratory infections 26 . The infectious characteristics of Klassevirus, the most abundant and highly occurring RNA viruses identified, are currently unknown. Klassevirus has recently been found to be globally widespread in sewage 27 . Finally, Cosavirus, a novel genus in the Picornaviridae family that was present in 25% of sludge samples in this study, has been recently identified in children with non-poliovirus acute flaccid paralysis in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and more recently in a minority of raw sewage samples from U.S. and European wastewater treatment facilities 23 .
 The presence of some emerging Picornaviruses in sewage may be potentially captured by Enterovirus culture-based monitoring. Plaque formation on BGM cell lines has been documented for Parechoviruses but not Klassevirus or Cosavirus 28 . However, these emerging Picornaviruses may have risk implications that are independent of typical Enteroviruses. Overall, the human virus content in sewage sludge samples is diverse. The occurrence and relative abundance values in this study reveal the gaps in approaches such as using fecal coliforms as an indicator of pathogen content in biosolids. As an example, limitations in the indicator approach can be viewed in a comparison of sample BE versus EE, where fecal coliforms are greater in the EE sample than the BE sample, but occurrence of viruses (Figure 2 ) was 40% for EE versus 75% for the BE sample.
 Although not common in metagenome studies, scientific investigations are dependent upon, and assume the reproducibility of results. Both biological and technical replicates performed in this study indicated that metagenome sequencing results were non-random and reproducible. The average coefficient of determination value (r 2 ) for biological replicates was 0.62 and the average r 2 value for technical sequencing replicates was 0.88. For biological replicates, human virus annotation was highly reproducible with only 3 disagreements in 40 pathogen annotations. These small differences are likely a factor of both inherent variability in the subset of nucleic acids prepared from the sample, laboratory variation in sample preparation, and the inclusion of technical sequencing variability in biological replicates. For all replicates, a bias was shown for sequences to be more readily annotated in one sequencing run over the other, as demonstrated by a slope of less than one and a non-zero intercept (Figure 4) , and pointing to factors such as inconsistencies in sample loading onto the sequencing instrument or variation between instrument performance.
 A selected group of metagenome viral pathogen identifications were further validated by PCR-based assays. For all viruses considered in this validation, metagenome sequencing under-represented human viruses compared to PCR. A lower degree of under-representation was associated with the higher relative abundances of human viruses identified through metagenomics, suggesting that these disagreement are likely due to insufficient sequencing depth, which ultimately results in higher method detection limits for human viruses. Adenovirus and Norovirus are notable examples. While PCR measures absolute presence/ absence, regardless of the abundance of non-target nucleic acids such as those from bacteriophages or other sewage-derived viruses, metagenomics measures only a relative abundance, meaning that even in cases when a pathogen has a high absolute abundance, the identification may be obscured by even higher concentrations of other viruses (bacteriophages or non-human eukaryote viruses). Based on the virus extraction efficiency and fraction of eluted RNA or DNA used in the PCR reaction, detection levels were in the range of 1.9×10 3 to 5.7×10 3 genome copies/dry gram. Previously reported concentrations of Enterovirus, Adenovirus, and Norovirus GII genomes in biosolids have averaged 1.4×10 4 , 1.3×10 5 , and 3.2×10 4 genome copies/dry gram, respectively 22 While the detection level is unknown for metagenomic approaches and partially dependent on the amount of sequence information generated (38.7 Gb generated here), the results in Table 2 illustrate that it is most certainly greater than the detection level for that of PCR. The greater sensitivity by PCR highlights the role of metagenomics as a method to reveal overall pathogen diversity, rather than a method to quantify concentration, and suggests that for biosolids, which are rich in bacteriophages and non-pathogenic eukaryote viruses, a greater amount of sequencing data will result in revealing an even larger diversity of human pathogens. The continuing trend of declining DNA sequencing costs should continue to enable and strengthen viral metagenomic approaches for revealing viral diversity 29 .
 Additional limitations to uncovering the full human virus diversity exist. Of the more than 10 8 unique viral genotypes estimated to exist in the world 30 , only 4,159 genomes were included in the amended NCBI viral genome database when this study was conducted. Additionally exacerbating this problem, sequenced viral genomes are biased towards those that have a culturable host (bacterial culture or eukaryotic cell line). The vast majority of viruses are unculturable in the laboratory, thus challenging efforts to improve our limited view of viral diversity. While this problem is less severe for human pathogens due to high medical interest and also because genomes are now being produced for viruses that are not culturable (e.g. Klassevirus and Norovirus), there is still likely human pathogen diversity that is not represented in the viral genome database. Large percentages of illnesses are currently undiagnosed. Indeed, efforts to understand the etiological agent in diarrheal and respiratory illness in humans have consistently resulted in no identified agent in more than 40% of cases 27, 31 .
 The results of this study serve to expand our view on the type, occurrence and abundance of viral pathogens in raw sewage sludge and class B biosolids. These results strongly suggest that current regulations for pathogens in sewage sludge that focus on fecal coliform indicators or the presence of Enterovirus, do not capture the full degree of pathogen diversity to which the public may be exposed during biosolids land application. Emerging viruses including Parechovirus, Klassevirus, Bocavirus, and Coronavirus HKU1, were abundantly identified, highlighting previously undemonstrated pathogen diversity in sewage sludge. These identifications demonstrate the need for developing an improved suite of indicator pathogens, and at a minimum, both DNA and RNA viruses, rather than just the RNA virus Enterovirus, must be considered in any future updates to sewage sludge regulation. More broadly, the viral metagenomics approaches applied here are reproducible and are applicable to any environmental sample where viral pathogen diversity may be a concern. However, viral metagenomics should be considered as an approach for revealing diversity, and should act as a basis for, rather than a substitute to, qPCR and culture-based monitoring.

Although it is not possible to study the very first events following HIV-1 transmission in humans in vivo, we have gained some understanding from studies in which mucosal tissue explants were infected in vitro [3] [4] [5] . In addition, the mechanism by which HIV-1 crosses the genital mucosal epithelium is unclear. Diffusion of HIV-1 across the vaginal mucosa is slowed by cervicovaginal mucus 9 . Virus replication at this focus might in fact be supported by early innate immune responses that lead to the recruitment of additional susceptible T cells to the site 16 . The failure of most infected foci to become established may be explained by the high error rate in reverse transcription that occurs during HIV-1 replication and the effects of the host antiviral apolipoprotein B mRNAediting enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) cytidine deaminases APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F, which cause many viruses produced in infected CD4 + T cells to be defective 17
 At the end of the eclipse phase, virus and/or virus-infected cells reach the draining lymph node, where they meet activated CD4 + CCR5 + T cells, which are targets for further infection. Up to 50% of germinal centres in the gut are lost within the first 80 days of infection 26 . In the absence of antiretroviral drug therapy (ART), the set point is maintained by a balance between virus turnover and the immune responses. For most infected memory T cells, the half-life is less than a day 34 . This is despite high levels of virus replication and acute CD4 + T cell depletion 39 , suggesting a role for immune activation in AIDS development. Multiple related events (reviewed in REF. Three vaccine approaches have been tested in clinical trials for efficacy. Frequent samples were taken before infection, through peak viraemia and sero-conversion 57, 58 . The production of acute-phase proteins can be triggered by proinflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-1 (IL-1)) and also by extrinsic factors such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is detectable in the plasma during chronic infection with HIV-1 or SIV and may be derived from commensal bacteria that translocate from the gut lumen following depletion of HIV-1-infected intestinal CCR5 + T helper 17 cells 21, 22, 59 . However, the intense cytokine response during acute HIV infection may also promote viral replication and mediate immunopathology (discussed below). High-level systemic cytokine responses during acute infections with avian influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus are likewise associated with immunopathological consequences 62, 63 . Prior to the peak in viraemia, blood NK cells proliferate and show enhanced activity when tested ex vivo 56 . NK and NKT cells can control HIV replication through cytolysis of virally infected cells and the production of antiviral cytokines and chemokines. This finding, and the clear role of KIR3D molecules in determining the viral set point 52, 54 , supports the involvement of NK cells in the control of HIV-1. However, the timing of NK cell antiviral effects remains uncertain. However, the activation of innate immunity should be attempted with caution, as innate immune responses can also be harmful. For example, induction of mucosal inflammatory responses by some microbicides has led to increased acquisition of HIV-1 infection (reviewed in REF. The opposing effects of innate immune activation were highlighted in a study in which IL-15 was administered to treat acute SIV infection in rhesus macaques: NK cell and SIV-specific CD8 + T cell numbers were increased, resulting in fewer SIV-infected cells in lymph nodes, but the activation and proliferation of CD4 + T cells was enhanced and a higher viral load was established 80 . Following the peak in the CD8 + T cell response, the virus sequence starts to change dramatically. Mutations in the viral envelope protein that were selected by neutralizing antibodies appeared later, at ~12 weeks. This pattern continues throughout the course of HIV infection 75 . Responses to other viral proteins, including the conserved Gag p24 and Pol proteins, tended to arise during later waves of T cell responses and may be more important for maintaining the viral load at the set point than for controlling early viraemia 75, 87, 88 . The loss of T cells after virus mutation implies complete loss of the epitope and no tendency for the virus to revert to the original sequence because of loss of fitness. A mathematical model has provided some answers 75 . Therefore, CD8 + T cells curb viraemia in acute HIV-1 infection. When a virus that has undergone such escape mutations is transmitted, its set point is also lower in the new host 90 . CD8 + T cells are also important for the maintenance of viral set point. There have been many reports of virus escape mutations from around the time the set point is reached 30,32,84,85,91-99 . Nevertheless, several epitopes for CD4 + T cells have been identified, particularly in Gag 105 . The first HIV-1specific IgA responses in mucosal secretions, which were detected within the first 3 weeks after T 0 , also recognized gp41 during acute HIV infection (N. L. Yates and G.D.T., unpublished observations). 130 ), the CD4-binding site recognized by the monoclonal antibody 1b12 (REF. 131 ) and the membrane-proximal region recognized by the monoclonal antibodies 2F5, Z13 and 4E10 (REFS 132-134) -are rarely generated during HIV-1 infection; when they do occur, they develop only after ~20-30 months of infection 57, 119, 120, 135 . Acute HIV-1 infection profoundly affects blood and tissue B cells 123 
 The finding that the generation of potentially protective antibodies is delayed until after initial control of viraemia ~12 weeks after transmission and then focused on only a few epitopes implies that it will be important to develop a vaccine that primes a very early and broad antibody response that targets multiple neutralizing epitopes for effective control of early viral expansion; the natural process is too little, too late. True sterilizing immunity can be attained only if the virus is prevented from infecting any host cells. This could be achieved only through broadspecificity neutralizing antibodies that are already present in the plasma and at mucosal sites before virus transmission. CD8 + T cell responses, which are clearly effective in reducing the peak viraemia during acute infection, could be enhanced through vaccination by increasing their breadth of epitope recognition so that, rather than mediating sequential responses to single epitopes, there would be a simultaneous multi-epitope-specific CD8 + T cell response to the virus 113, 147, 148 . It can be thought to be good news that most HIV-1 transmissions that result in productive infection are mediated by only one virion, indicating a vulnerability of the virus to immune attack during the eclipse phase. The time at which plasma viraemia settles to a stable level (within approximately 3-6 months from the onset of HIV infection). Viral set point is partially predictive of both how quickly HIV infection will progress and the risk of HIV transmission. The ability of a virus to replicate in a given environment.

57,57,f5589aa53f51c3495d6f07bb1e4ad600f8b53b3f,,Resident viruses and their interactions with the immune system NIH Public Access Author Manuscript,"The human body is colonized with a diverse resident microflora that includes viruses. Recent studies of metagenomes have begun to characterize the composition of the human 'virobiota' and its associated genes (the 'virome'), and have fostered the emerging field of host-virobiota interactions. In this Perspective, we explore how resident viruses interact with the immune system. We review recent findings that highlight the role of the immune system in shaping the composition of the virobiota and consider how resident viruses may impact host immunity. Finally, we discuss the implications of virobiota-immune system interactions for human health.
 The human body is colonized by commensal microorganisms that encompass diverse phyla from the three domains of life: Eukarya, Archaea and Bacteria. Most of these microorganisms reside at body surfaces that are in direct contact with the environment, including the intestine, skin and respiratory tract. Research efforts over the past two decades have focused primarily on the bacterial component of the human microbiota and its associated genes (the 'microbiome'). These efforts have yielded a wealth of insight about the composition of human-associated bacterial communities, how these resident bacteria interact with the immune system and how bacteria-immune system interactions are altered in disease 1,2 .
 Recently, it has become apparent that the microbiota of healthy humans also includes viruses, termed the 'virobiota' 3 . Much of our current knowledge of the virobiota is derived from metagenomics, studies in which the DNA (and sometimes RNA) content of a microbial community is sequenced 4-6 . These studies have revealed that the human microbiome includes many viral genes (the 'virome'). The intestine and the skin, for example, are both associated with viruses that replicate in eukaryotic cells (eukaryotic viruses), and viruses that replicate in bacteria (bacteriophages or phages) 5-7 . The intestinal microbiota also contains viruses that infect plants, which are likely associated with the host diet 5,6,8 .
 Bacteria that inhabit the intestine and skin are generally regarded as stable residents that confer metabolic and/or immune benefits to their hosts 9 . It is therefore reasonable to ask","whether viruses also can be stably associated with healthy human tissues. In the case of bacteriophages, a persistent, nonpathogenic association seems possible as viral replication occurs in bacterial hosts, which can themselves be stable members of the microbiota. In contrast, the relationship of eukaryotic viruses to their human hosts is much less clear. Such viruses require host cells to replicate and in most cases trigger innate and/or adaptive immune responses after entry into host cells. Thus, the eukaryotic viruses sampled in metagenomic studies could include those from acute, acute recurrent or chronic infections, or newly emerged latent viruses. In the absence of detailed longitudinal metagenomic studies of the virobiota, it is difficult to know at this point whether the human eukaryotic virobiota includes truly resident viruses that are stably associated with healthy host tissues.
 In this Perspective we will discuss how the virobiota interacts with the immune system and how this could impact host health. We will focus most of our discussion on viruses associated with tissues that interface with the external environment (for example, intestine, skin and respiratory tract). It is important to recognize that the study of the virobiota is an emerging field and that our understanding of how these viruses interact with the immune system is currently minimal. Thus, some of our discussion will be speculative by necessity. However, our aim is to provide a framework for thinking about virobiota-immune system interactions in mammalian hosts and to motivate experimental studies of these interactions.
 Metagenomic studies of microbiota at various tissue sites have revealed that many of the viruses associated with healthy human tissues are bacteriophages 5, 6, 10 . Sequencing of the metagenome from human fecal material has revealed that many phages associate with the gastrointestinal microbiota, which can harbor up to 10 14 bacterial cells. Phage populations diversify in the intestine as new members of the bacterial community are introduced, suggesting that phage diversity and bacterial diversity are linked 11 .
 Intestinal phages are genetically and morphologically heterogeneous. They include both lysogenic prophages, which are stably integrated into the bacterial chromosome, and lytic phages, which actively infect and lyse bacteria 12 . Prophages can undergo lytic induction to produce infectious phage particles when bacterial cells encounter environmental stressors or are stimulated by nutrients 13, 14 . Metagenomic sequencing has revealed a few dominant families of intestinal phages that include double-and single-stranded DNA phages 5, 15 . Although there is minimal variation of intestinal phage populations in individuals over time, there is substantial variation between individuals 5,6 , even when those individuals have similar bacterial community structures 9 .
 Phages likely have a profound impact on the composition and functional properties of the bacterial microbiota, which in turn could shape development and function of the immune system. First, phages may serve as important reservoirs of genetic diversity in the microbiota by acting as vehicles for the horizontal transfer of virulence, antibiotic resistance and metabolic determinants among bacteria 16 . Bacterial acquisition of phage genes could modify the functional properties of the microbiota, thereby substantially impacting host metabolism and immunity.
 Second, phages may impact the composition of commensal bacterial populations through the predation of susceptible bacterial strains. This was suggested by recent studies of Enterococcus faecalis V583, a commensal of the human intestine. When E. faecalis V583 colonizes the intestines of mice, it produces lytic phages derived from chromosomally encoded prophage elements 14 . Production of the phage particles confers an advantage to E. faecalis V583 in competition with closely related enterococcus strains. This indicates that phages have the potential to influence the assembly and composition of intestinal bacterial communities 14 . Phage predation may be widespread, as suggested by the presence of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) systems in many human commensal bacteria. CRISPRs are genetic modules in which short repeats of foreign DNA are inserted between spacer sequences in the bacterial chromosome. The spacer sequences are transcribed into short complementary RNAs that target invading DNA for destruction. Bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract and oral mucosa have acquired CRISPR-specific spacer sequences homologous to phage DNA 6, 17 , suggesting that commensal bacteria are preyed upon by lytic phages in the mammalian host.
 The ability of phages to shape the genetic diversity and the species diversity of the microbiota is likely to substantially impact the host immune system. It is well established that certain bacterial groups have distinctive effects on maturation of the immune system. For example, individual commensal species in the intestine influence the proportions of lamina propria T lymphocyte subsets that have distinct effector functions 18, 19 . This in turn has profound effects on whether proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory immunity develops. Furthermore, commensal bacteria specifically limit and promote viral infection and transmission in mammalian hosts [20] [21] [22] . It is thus interesting to consider whether phage predation of intestinal bacteria could alter community composition in ways that impact function of the immune system and influence the spread of pathogenic viruses.
 The resident viruses of humans also include viruses that infect eukaryotic cells. Like bacteriophages, populations of eukaryotic viruses in humans are heterogeneous, with distinct groups of viruses predominating in different tissues (Fig. 1 ). For example, the virobiota associated with adult human skin swabs is composed almost exclusively of polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, a DNA virus associated with cutaneous cancer 7, 23 . The frequency of human infection by resident polyomaviruses is likely to be high because ~70% of humans test seropositive for antibodies to Merkel cell polyomavirus 23 . Human skin also harbors an abundance of human papillomaviruses that are related to the βand γpapillomaviruses 7 .
 A complex viral population is also associated with the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity and the respiratory tract. Both PCR and metagenome sequencing have been used to characterize the composition of the viral communities associated with the oral mucosa. These studies show a consistent presence of DNA from human herpes viruses and related viruses 24, 25 . Metagenomic studies of the nasopharynx microbiota also suggest that the respiratory tract is rich in viruses. Analysis of nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients experiencing respiratory-tract infections revealed the presence of many respiratory viruses, including human respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus and rhinoviruses. Viral nucleic acid is also present in respiratory aspirates of healthy children and indicates the presence of adenoviruses, picornaviruses and coronaviruses 26, 27 .
 Several studies of the human intestinal virome have suggested that eukaryotic viruses are rare relative to bacterial viruses 5, 6, 8 . However, genetic signatures of eukaryotic singlestranded RNA viruses, single-stranded DNA viruses, double-stranded DNA viruses and retroviruses have been detected in the fecal viromes of healthy individuals 5 . Human papillomavirus also has been detected but only in a single subject 28 . Genetic signatures of many plant viruses have been detected in metagenomic studies of the human intestinal virome 5, 8 . In particular, metagenomic studies of RNA viruses of the human intestine suggest that plant viruses are prevalent in this group and are likely derived from the diet 8 . Eukaryotic viral sequences are more prevalent in the intestines of diseased individuals. For example, feces from individuals with diarrheal disease and acute flaccid paralysis harbor a dominant population of DNA and RNA eukaryotic viral sequences derived from picornaviruses and parvoviruses 29, 30 .
 Much remains to be done to fully define the composition of the viral communities associated with human mucosal tissues and skin. For example, most metagenomic studies of humanassociated viral populations have focused on analyzing viral DNA content. A more complete characterization of RNA viruses associated with humans will undoubtedly provide a more complete picture of the virobiota. Furthermore, as noted above, it remains unclear whether the eukaryotic viruses associated with healthy human mucosal tissues are the result of chronic or latent infections or whether they arise from acute but transient viral infections. Careful longitudinal metagenomic studies of viral populations associated with mucosal tissue will be required to resolve these issues and to identify those viruses that stably inhabit human tissues.
 The study of resident viruses is an emerging field, and thus our current understanding of how these viruses interact with the immune system is limited. However, our knowledge of how the bacterial microbiota interacts with the immune system provides a useful framework for our initial consideration of virobiota-immune system interactions. Here we consider key concepts that have emerged from studies of the bacterial microbiota and how they might promote our understanding of host-associated viruses and their interactions with the mammalian immune system.
 Studies of commensal bacteria-host interactions have suggested that a key driving force in the evolution of the mammalian immune system has been the need to maintain homeostatic relationships with resident bacteria 31, 32 . In the intestine, for example, the immune system has a central role in controlling the density and the composition of resident bacterial communities 33, 34 . Recent studies in primates suggest that there is a similar relationship between the immune system and the intestinal virobiota. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a primate virus related to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), causes AIDS in rhesus monkeys. SIV infection of rhesus monkeys is associated with damage to the intestinal barrier (enteropathy), which promotes AIDS progression. Until recently, the causes of this enteropathy have not been clear. A metagenomic study of the virome of SIV-infected rhesus monkeys showed that SIV infection is associated with a dramatic expansion of the intestinal virome 4 . This viral expansion was associated with enteropathy, particularly in monkeys that harbored adenoviruses (Fig. 2) . These findings suggest that virome expansion is linked to the pathology observed in AIDS and highlights the role of the immune system in controlling virus populations in the intestine. Viral populations associated with mucosal tissue are also altered in other disease states. In the human lung, cystic fibrosis or acute respiratory infection can result in the expansion of certain viral species 35, 36 . The lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis have many retrotranscribing RNA viruses and human herpes viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus, which has been linked to poor clinical outcomes in children with cystic fibrosis. The lung virome of patients with cystic fibrosis is highly variable as compared to healthy human lungs, where virome composition is relatively constant 36 . It has been proposed that viruses in healthy lungs may cause short-term infections that are rapidly cleared by the host immune system, whereas in the lung of a patient with cystic fibrosis these viruses may be more persistent 36 , perhaps as a result of compromised host immunity. The metabolic profile of the lung of a patient with cystic fibrosis suggests that it is enriched in aromatic amino acids and phosphate 36 . This may influence the outgrowth of bacterial species that can shape the virobiota and possibly alter the severity of disease. It is intriguing to consider that competition among bacteria in the lungs and the success of certain species based on the metabolic environment may modulate the composition of virobiota in the lungs, ultimately leading to progression of disease if host immunity is compromised.
 Early comparisons of germ-free and conventionally colonized mice revealed a profound effect of the microbiota on the formation of lymphoid tissue and subsequent development of the immune system 1 . Since then, many studies have established the importance of resident bacteria in promoting normal development and function of the immune system 18, 19 . Commensal bacteria also can prime immune responses that provide cross-protection for pathogenic infections 37, 38 . Given the presence of diverse families of eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses at multiple human body sites, it is likely that viruses associated with mucosal tissue also have a pronounced influence on development and function of the immune system and could impact the host's ability to fight pathogenic viral infections.
 One way that the virobiota could impact host immunity is by triggering immune responses that protect against pathogenic viral and/or bacterial infections. It has been estimated that the average human has ~8-12 chronic viral infections at any given time 39 . These infections are caused by a variety of different viruses, including papillomaviruses, herpes viruses and polyomaviruses, that often reside in tissues of healthy individuals (Fig. 1) . Certain resident eukaryotic viruses can cause acute or latent infections that transition to chronic infections, where viral particles are shed throughout life. For example, herpes viruses infect most people during childhood, and latent herpes infection can lead to shedding of viral particles throughout the lifetime of an individual. Although latency and reactivation of herpes virus infection is considered pathogenic, chronic herpes virus infection has been shown to protect the host from viral and bacterial infections 40 . Protection is conferred by chronic infection with select types of herpes viruses, including γ-herpes viruses, which increase basal interferon γ (IFN-γ) expression and facilitate activation of macrophages. This in turn limits the spread of other infecting bacteria and viruses.
 Some chronic viral infections lead to a decrease in host immunity that promotes immune suppression and greater susceptibility to infection. As discussed above, SIV can trigger AIDS in some primate species, which results in an expansion of the intestinal virome 4 . In another example, chronic infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus hinders the expression of type I interferons and promotes the opportunistic invasion of murine cytomegalovirus 41 .
 These studies highlight a fine balance between viral symbiosis and pathogenesis during chronic infections. As discussed above, the community of resident human associated viruses is not yet clearly defined, but viruses that maintain chronic infections may represent bona fide stable residents of the human virobiota. The nature of the association of particular viruses with the host (chronic or transient) will likely have a profound impact on the immune response to viral and bacterial pathogen challenge. This suggests that when analyzing host immune status, composition of the resident viral community and the potential existence of chronically associated viruses must be considered.
 Bacteriophages are a long-overlooked component of the virobiota that have the potential to shape mammalian immunity. Several studies have shown that phages can trigger a host immune response or can modulate host immunity. It is not surprising that humoral antibody responses can be mounted to phages that have been used to immunize animals at high titers 42, 43 . Phages can also inhibit activation and proliferation of human T cells in vitro through an unknown mechanism 44 . Finally, phage and their nucleic acids alter the expression of innate immune genes in mouse tissues 45, 46 . Despite these intriguing findings, virtually nothing is known about whether phages can influence innate and adaptive immunity during natural associations with mammals.
 There are several possible routes by which phages could become exposed to mammalian tissues and trigger immune responses. For example, it is known that oral administration of phages to animals results in the translocation of phages to systemic tissues [47] [48] [49] . This suggests that mammals have mechanisms for uptake and delivery of phage that may allow intestinal phages to elicit innate and adaptive immune responses. One possible uptake route involves dendritic cells, which are known to sample intestinal luminal contents 50 and can actively phagocytize phage particles in culture 51 . Phage engulfment renders dendritic cells incapable of further phagocytosis, suggesting that phage sampling by dendritic cells could negatively impact their proinflammatory functions 52 . Alternatively, phage antigens could be presented by dendritic cells to T cells, resulting in the development of cell-mediated immunity and cytokine release. Intestinal phages associate with the intestinal mucosal surface in larger numbers in patients afflicted with Crohn's disease 53 , raising the question of whether phages may influence the development of intestinal inflammatory diseases.
 It is also interesting to consider whether bacteriophages might elicit antiviral innate immune responses. Mammalian cells are endowed with the ability to detect viral nucleic acids through several pattern-recognition receptors that are positioned to detect viral entry into cells (Fig. 3) . These pattern-recognition receptors include viral RNA sensors, such as the endosomal Toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR8, and RIG-I, a cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA helicase 54 . There are also DNA sensors, including TLR9, which detects endosomal DNA, and the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase 55, 56 . RIG-I can also indirectly sense viral DNA with the aid of RNA polymerase III, which converts cytoplasmic DNA into 5′-phosphorylated RNA that can be recognized by RIG-I (ref. 54) . Each of these sensors initiates signaling cascades that activate expression of type I interferon, inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-1β and chemokines including IL-8 and CXCL-10. If resident bacteriophages can enter host cells, it is possible that they would activate one or more of these pathways, as their nucleic acids would likely be exposed to either the endosomal or cytoplasmic viral nucleic acid sensors (Fig. 3) . This could induce a tonic stimulation of antiviral immunity that might confer an advantage to the host by protecting against pathogenic viral infections.
 Another way in which phages could become exposed to the mammalian immune system is through their association with commensal bacteria. Many commensal bacteria harbor prophages in their genomes and can induce these elements to produce phage particles in vivo 14 . Under certain conditions, such as host immunodeficiency, commensal bacteria from the intestine can enter epithelial cells or become engulfed by phagocytic cells. Phage particles associated with these bacteria could be exposed to the cytoplasm or to endocytic compartments of cells and could thus prime innate or adaptive immune responses (Fig. 3) . In this way, bacteria could be delivery vehicles for phages that are sensed by the immune system.
 Human intestinal phages have diversity-generating mechanisms that may facilitate evasion of host adaptive immunity. Sequencing of the metagenome of the human intestinal virome revealed that phage genomes are rich in regions of hypervariability 28 . Most of these hypervariable regions map to phage tail-fiber genes that are diversified to allow the encoded proteins to bind variable phage receptors 28 . Other hypervariable regions have been observed in genes encoding predicted immunoglobulin superfamily proteins, suggesting that such proteins could act as scaffolds for the presentation of diversified phage peptide sequences. The phage diversity-generating mechanism relies on error-prone reverse transcription 28, 57 . Although the physiological relevance of these hypervariable regions is not yet clear, such a diversity-generating mechanism could allow phages to evade antibodies that target the phage particles.
 Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have led to the discovery that viruses are an important component of the microbial communities that inhabit healthy human tissues. Emerging information about the interactions between resident viruses and the immune system suggests that these interactions are as intricate and as coevolved as those involving the bacterial microbiota.
 Going forward, it is imperative that resident host-associated viruses be incorporated into models of host-microbiota interactions. It will be important to perform careful longitudinal studies of the viral populations associated with healthy human tissues to determine the stability of these populations and how they may evolve over time. There is a need for further studies aimed at understanding how resident prokaryotic phages and eukaryotic viruses shape commensal bacterial communities and how this impacts host immunity. Future work should also focus on exploring the extent to which resident phages and eukaryotic viruses activate host innate and adaptive immunity. Examination of how resident viruses interact with host cells may reveal new host immune factors that lie outside of currently known canonical pathways of antiviral immunity.
 Future experimental explorations of virobiota-immune system interactions will undoubtedly be challenging and will require new tools and approaches. However, such studies hold the promise of exciting insight into the complex relationships between humans and their associated microbial communities and may yield new strategies for enhancing human health. Anatomical locations of resident viruses in humans. The human body is populated by resident viruses that include both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses. These viruses are associated with various tissues, including the oral cavity, nasopharynx, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, and the skin surface. Studies that identified viruses in various host tissues are referenced. Model for bacteriophage recognition by antiviral innate immune sensors. DNA and RNA phages could be sensed by components of the mammalian innate immune system if cells directly phagocytize phage particles or if phages are delivered to the intracellular environment by phage-producing bacteria. After degradation of the phage particle, phagocytized phage nucleic acids could be sensed by endosomal Toll-like receptors such as TLR7 or TLR9. If intracellular phages are uncoated in the cytoplasm, the released nucleic acids could be sensed by the sensors cGAMP synthase (DNA) or RIG-I (RNA), which signal through stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), respectively. These viral nucleic acid sensors activate the transcription factors NF-κB, IRF3 and IRF7 to promote the transcription of antiviral effectors such as IFN-β and proinflammatory cytokines.",f5589aa53f51c3495d6f07bb1e4ad600f8b53b3f,2013-06-18,"Duerkop, Breck A; Hooper, Lora V",Nature Immunology,10.1038/ni.2614,Nature Immunology,344.0,True,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were originally described in human lymph nodes in the 1950s 1 . We begin by discussing the phenotype of pDCs and the mechanisms that control their development. CD2 is a cell adhesion molecule that is expressed by a subset of human pDCs 13 . CD2 hi pDCs produce lysozyme, but whether this endows them with the capacity to lyse bacteria is unknown. BST2 (also known as Tetherin 14 ) is fairly specific to pDCs and plasma cells in steady-state conditions but is induced on many cell types following exposure to type I and type II IFNs 15 . In addition, studies in reporter mice have confirmed Siglech mRNA transcription in progenitor cells 18, 20, 21 . In peripheral tissues, the majority of mouse pDCs express CC chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9), Ly49Q and SCA1; however, in the bone marrow these markers distinguish pDC subsets that differ in developmental stage and/or activation state (Box 1). CCR9 − cells are pDC-like common DC precursors, whereas CCR9 + cells are fully differentiated pDCs. In general, studies on bone marrow pDC subsets concur that newly generated pDCs or their close precursors may be more efficient at producing type I IFN than mature pDCs in the bone marrow and in the periphery, at least in response to TLR agonists. subsequently can differentiate into both Rag1-positive and Rag1-negative mature pDCs. FLT3L promotes pDC development through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 38, 39 . LAMTOR2 is a member of the Ragulator complex known to inhibit mTOR signaling. Indeed, pDCs can be derived from M-CSFR + CDP 23, 27 and Csf1 −/− mice have reduced numbers of both pDCs and cDCs 43 . E proteins form homodimers or heterodimers with each other and bind to conserved E box sequences, a process that can be perturbed by inhibitor of differentiation (ID) proteins. ID2, a repressor of E2-2, is essentially absent in pDCs, but is prominently expressed in cDCs and supports CD8α + DC development from CDPs 28, 50 . STAT3 stimulates FLT3L-dependent expression of E2-2, whereas STAT5 induces GM-CSFdependent expression of ID2 ( Figure 2) . factor independent 1 (GFI1) and nuclear polyadenylated RNA-binding protein 2 (NAB2). PU.1 directly regulates FLT3 expression in a concentration-dependent manner and is necessary for both pDC and cDC development 223 . XBP1 deficiency results in impaired survival and reduced numbers of pDCs and cDCs 225 . Hypoxia-inducible factors influence hematopoiesis and maintain HSC function. NAB2 is a transcriptional corepressor that induces TRAIL expression in activated pDCs 230 . MicroRNAs represent another class of regulatory molecules that control different aspects of pDC development and function. Epigenetic or chromatin modifiers may also have a prominent role in DC lineage commitment and development. More studies are required to define the various components of this complex as well as the genomic regions that interact with this complex and drive the expression of molecules that define pDC phenotype and function. Initial studies showed that pDC migration is quite different from that of cDCs. In addition to secondary lymphoid organs, pDCs also migrate from blood into peripheral tissues. CXCR4 also promotes pDC recruitment to tumors that produce CXCL12 72 . During inflammation, CXCR3 and CCR5 drive pDC migration into inflamed tissues 73,74 . CCR6 and CCR10 are expressed by a subset of pDCs in human tonsil and facilitate migration to inflamed epithelia in response to CCL20 and CCL27 76 . CX3CR1 is expressed by pDCs; however, its role in pDC migration and homeostasis is not well characterized. IkappaB kinase-alpha (IKKα) 95 , osteopontin 96 and mTOR 97 are key components of the MyD88-IRF7 signaling pathway, while IRF5 is essential for MyD88-NF-κB signaling 98, 99 . Forward genetic approaches have further identified Slc15a4, which encodes the peptide/histidine transporter 1 (PHT1), and BLOC1 and BLOC2 Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome proteins as key components required for TLR9 signaling in pDCs but not in other cell types 101 . This process is called microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)associated phagocytosis (LAP) and involves autophagy-related proteins but not the conventional autophagic pre-initiation complex. In addition to having a role in pDC migration, DOCK2 is essential for TLR7-and TLR9-mediated type I IFN production in pDCs, most likely because of its influence on actin cytoskeleton and vesicular trafficking 108 . TLR9, but not TLR7, signaling is also dependent on Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) 109 . Additional studies are required to provide an integrated view of how all these molecules coordinate the trafficking and signaling properties of TLR7/9containing vesicles in pDCs. PSA is an immunomodulatory molecule expressed by the ubiquitous gut microorganism Bacteriodes fragilis 112 . Major cytosolic sensors of nucleic acids, such as cGAS and STING 114 , are likely to be investigated in pDCs in the near future as well. When pDCs receive activation signals through TLRs or other pattern recognition receptors, they act as immunogenic cells. Thus, the role of pDC subsets in tolerance remains to be further explored. Antigens targeted to pDCs through DCIR are also presented to T cells 120 . In mice, it was shown that targeting a T cell epitope derived from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) to pDCs via SIGLEC-H delays onset and decreases disease severity in a model of MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by reducing the expansion and polarization of Th1 and Th17 cell populations 149 . Thus, targeting antigen to pDCs can either promote or inhibit antigen-specific immune responses, depending on the antigen formulation and mode of stimulation or delivery. Through this mechanism, pDCs may contribute to adaptive responses during viral infections. Paradoxically, pDC responses to acute viral infections may not always be beneficial. The role of pDCs in chronic viral infections, such as HIV-1, is even more complex, involving pDC activation, trafficking, type I IFN production and interaction with CD4 + T cells (reviewed in 161 ). Moreover, new evidence indicates that pDCs upregulate the gut-homing markers α4β7 and CD103 and accumulate in the gut mucosa during SIV and HIV infections 162, 163 . Conversely, studies in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection have provided a different view. Moreover, early administration of exogenous type I IFN prevents chronic LCMV infection. However, late type I IFN administration has no beneficial effects 173 . Thus, there is a window of opportunity -i.e. early during infection -when type I IFNs and pDCs can be both beneficial and necessary to prevent or control chronic viral infection and preserve T cell numbers and functions. Endogenous GC also have an impact on pDC homeostasis and survival 185 . Genetic models that specifically address the contribution of pDCs in autoimmunity have been lacking until recently. The deleterious role(s) of pDCs in psoriasis and T1D have not been confirmed yet in genetic models, but blockade of type I IFN or antibody-mediated depletion of pDCs appears to confer protection in mouse models of these diseases [197] [198] [199] . pDCs that have been developed in the presence of type I IFN resemble Peyer's patch pDCs, produce inflammatory cytokines, stimulate Th17 cell generation and fail to secrete IFNα after TLR engagement 202 . Gut-associated pDCs are also efficient at generating mucosal B cell responses under normal conditions and during infection with a gut-tropic virus. Therefore, specific microbial communities are likely to have a profound impact on pDC homeostasis and function through both direct and indirect mechanisms. Although many immune functions of pDCs have now been described, many questions still remain concerning their complex biology. So what is the role of pDCs in tuberculosis and in bacterial infections in general? Can bacterial products activate pDCs and what are the sensors for these products? CD56 expression is also typical of several neoplastic human pDC tumors 248 . Addressing these and other questions in mouse models will require advanced tools to deplete pDCs in vivo. It will be important to continue to identify pDC-specific genes that can be used for development of pDC lineage-specific deficient mice and pDC-specific Cre deleters. Indeed, it will be interesting to explore the therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies that selectively target pDCs in many of the disease scenarios discussed above. Transcriptional targets of E2-2 encode proteins associated with pDC development, homeostasis and function. TLR7, TLR9 and PACSIN1 enable pDC recognition of nucleic acids and pathogens (i.e. RNA and DNA viruses), resulting in type I IFN secretion and/or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Swiecki pDCs express chemokine receptors and homing molecules that promote recruitment in the steady-state and during inflammation. Blood pDCs express the chemerin receptor, ChemR23, as well as A1-R, C3aR and C5aR, which may guide them to peripheral LNs and damaged tissues. CD2AP is an intracellular protein that regulates actin dynamics and promotes pDC migration to LNs under inflammatory settings. MAdCAM-1, β7 integrin and CD103 also influence pDC trafficking to the gut. pDCs sense DNA viruses, synthetic CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODN) and endogenous DNA through TLR9. TLR9 is transported to appropriate intracellular compartments by UNC93B 249, 250 and requires cleavage in order to recruit MyD88 251, 252 . This process requires IRF5, BTK and SLC15A4. TLR7 stimulation by viral and endogenous RNA may follow similar pathways."
58,58,47599902cfeaaf5cea64838d8179f9ac326a38ea,,The Effects of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine on Nasopharyngeal Bacteria in Healthy 2 to 4 Year Olds A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Rationale: Viral infections of the upper respiratory tract may influence the commensal nasopharyngeal bacteria. Changes in the bacterial niche could affect transmission dynamics. Attenuated vaccine viruses can be used to investigate this empirically in humans.
 Objectives: To study the effects of mild viral upper respiratory infections on nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization using live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) as a surrogate.
 Methods: We used trivalent LAIV to evaluate the effects of viral infection on bacterial carriage and density of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 151 healthy children were randomized 1:1 to receive the vaccine starting either at recruitment (n = 74) or 28 days later (n = 77) in a stepped wedge fashion, allowing comparisons between recipients and nonrecipients as well as wholegroup comparisons pre-and postvaccination. Bacterial carriage and density were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays.","Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are effective principally through populationwide effects on carriage and transmission (1) . Despite this, the biology of colonization and determinants of transmission remain poorly understood. Evidence from both animals (2) and humans (3) suggests that respiratory viral infections can affect upper respiratory tract bacteria. However, the relevance of experiments in animal models to humans is uncertain, and deductions about causation based on observational studies are difficult. Studies by our group and others have shown that presence and colonization density of commensal bacteria of the nasopharynx (NP) are associated with symptoms of rhinitis and presence of respiratory viruses (4, 5) .
 Intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was licensed in Europe in 2012 for children aged 2-18 years, and until 2014 (when a second B strain was added) it consisted of three replication-competent viruses (two type A strains and one type B strain) attenuated by recombination of wild-type (WT) and attenuated donor viruses (6) and by cold adaptation through passages of progressively lower temperature in eggs (7) . The vaccine viruses induce broad cell-mediated and local mucosal antibody responses (8) . They replicate well at the lower temperatures of the upper respiratory mucosa but poorly in the lower airways or systemic circulation (9) . LAIV is well tolerated, safe, and effective in preventing culture-and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-proven influenza in children (10, 11) , among whom influenza is a common and sometimes serious infection. However, when compared with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV), higher rates of medically significant wheezing were observed during the second to fourth weeks postvaccination in children 6-23 months of age after the first dose of vaccine (5.9% in LAIV recipients vs. 3.8% in TIV recipients, as shown in Figure 3 in the online supplement in Belshe and colleagues [12] ). In addition, increased all-cause hospitalization in children aged 6-11 months within 180 days of vaccination (6.1% in LAIV recipients vs. 2.6% in TIV recipients) (11) was observed, leading to restriction of licensure to children aged 2 years and older (13, 14) . The pathophysiology of these adverse events is not understood.
 Mina and colleagues (15) found a transient increase in density and delayed clearance of NP Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus in a mouse model after administration of either a single cold-adapted LAIV strain or WT influenza virus. No clinical disease was seen in animals given attenuated virus, although up to 5% weight loss was observed if S. pneumoniae was present before vaccination. Thus, both WT and attenuated influenza infection could influence bacterial load in the human NP, although extrapolation to humans and LAIV should be done with caution.
 Demonstration of a similar effect in humans might help elucidate the relationships between respiratory viral infections and carriage prevalence and density dynamics of NP bacteria. The availability of LAIV that induces a mild upper respiratory tract infection without significant clinical illness offers an opportunity to undertake randomized interventional experimental studies in humans to explore this possibility.
 Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) can enumerate bacterial species-specific gene copies and thus both viable and nonviable bacteria in biological samples over wide concentration ranges with less effort and expense than required with conventional quantitative plate cultures. Using qPCR, we recently described upper respiratory bacterial density ranges as wide as 6 orders of magnitude in healthy children (16) . Such differences may result in wide variation in efficiency of onward transmission among carriers. Although alternatives exist, nasopharyngeal swabbing is the most widely used method to sample the nasal flora, is easy to perform, and is reasonably well accepted by children.
 To explore the effect of LAIV on carriage rates and density of four bacterial species that commonly colonize the human NP, we recruited 151 children into a prospective randomized study to compare vaccinated and unvaccinated children at 1 and 4 weeks postvaccine and colonization before and after vaccination in the whole group. At the time of the study, no routine influenza immunization was being offered to healthy children in the United Kingdom.
 Some of the results of this study were reported previously in the form of an abstract (17) .
 We conducted a cohort stepped wedge study of an LAIV containing three (two A and one B) influenza strains in children at 10 day care centers (DCCs) in Bristol, UK.
 Children aged 2-4 years attending the DCCs were eligible to participate. We attempted to provide written information sheets with an invitation to take part in the study to parents of all of the 659 eligible children in the 10 DCCs. We were able to make contact with 80% of the parents and invite them to take part in the study between September 3 and October 15, 2012. Only children for whom the vaccine was contraindicated were excluded ( Figure 1 (Figure 1 ). If the child refused vaccination, only NP swabbing was attempted. Laboratory staff were blinded to the intervention assignment during analysis.
 Vaccine doses were given intranasally following monitored cold chain storage and after medical assessment of each subject. Following immunization, children were observed for 30 minutes. At all study visits, which were conducted at the DCCs between October 2012 and February 2013, a fine-tip pediatric NP swab (Peel Pouch Dryswab; Medical Wire and Equipment, Corsham, UK) was taken. For the swabbing procedure, the child was seated comfortably with the head slightly extended. The swab was inserted horizontally until resistance was met when the swab was retracted with a slight twisting action along the axis of the shaft and inserted into a 2-ml tube prefilled with 1.5 ml of skim milk, tryptone, glucose, and glycerol broth, which was labeled with a random number to blind laboratory analysis. The records linking the study participant and visit numbers with the blinding numbers were kept in a locked facility until after the completion of laboratory analysis. Tubes were kept at 0-4 8 C until transferred to storage at 280 8 C within 4 hours of collection. At the time of collection of each swab, the severity of any rhinitis symptoms was recorded (Symptoms of Nasal Outflow Tally score of 0-3 as previously reported [4] and as described in the online supplement).
 Nucleic acid was extracted from all samples using the Virus/Pathogen Mini Kit from QIAGEN (Valencia, CA), yielding 110-ml extracts from 300 ml of skim milk, tryptone, glucose, and glycerol broth. These extracts were stored at 280 8 C. Monoplex qPCR assays were used to detect S. pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and S. aureus (16) . The cycle threshold (Ct) value used to define detection was set at less than or equal to 35 cycles. For density values, Ct values were converted into gene copies (GC)/ml using standard curves (16) . qPCR assays for adenovirus, bocavirus, influenza (A and B), respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza (types 1-3), parechovirus, coronavirus (229E, OC43, and NL63), and enterovirus were performed using methods described previously (4, 18) . In addition, an assay for coronavirus HKU1 (see Table E1 in the online supplement) was used.
 The primary endpoint was a comparison of the proportion of children positive for S. pneumoniae 1 week after a first dose of LAIV compared with the control group. Additional planned endpoints included similar comparisons for M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae or S. aureus at 1 and 4 weeks after LAIV; the density of all four species after the same intervals, both singly and combined; the proportions of positive subjects; and carriage density for the four species before and after one or two doses of LAIV over all study visits, both in all children studied and in those who were or were not carriers of each species at the first visit. Exploratory and descriptive analyses, respectively, were also done with respect to rhinitis symptom scores and presence of respiratory viral nucleic acid in samples.
 Statistical analyses were done using Stata version 12.0 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX). To assess balance at randomization, differences in characteristics were analyzed using Pearson's x 2 test and t tests when appropriate. We estimated the odds ratio of carriage for each bacterial species in the early vaccine group compared with the control (late vaccine) group at V2 and V3 postenrollment using logistic regression, including a fixed effect for the vaccine group and a random effect (intercept) for nurseries to allow for between-nursery variability. We also estimated the odds ratios of carriage after one and two doses of LAIV (i.e., children contributed measurements before and after their vaccination) using logistic regression and adjusting for confounders (detailed in footnotes to Tables 1 and 2), with random effects (intercept) for nurseries and children to allow for repeated measures in the same individuals and between-nursery variability. We estimated the difference in mean density (GC/ml) of bacteria in those children positive for carriage (at baseline and the visit of interest) using g-regression (because GC/ml were positively skewed), including the same fixed and random effects as we used for the odds of carriage analysis. We modeled the effect of the vaccine from one visit after the vaccine was administered. Analyses were done on the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all enrolled participants who provided an assessable swab sample, regardless of whether they actually received the vaccine doses. Analyses were undertaken using the GLLAMM program in Stata (19) (20) (21) .
 Trial registration was initiated (EudraCT identifier 2011-002964-25), but, owing to regulatory authority determination that this was not an investigational medicinal product trial because the vaccine was licensed for this age group, registration could not be completed.
 The study was approved by the U.K. National Research Ethics Service -Central Bristol Committee (11/SW/0186), and responsibility for governance oversight was taken by the University of Bristol, UK.
 A Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram detailing screening, enrollment, randomization, loss to follow-up, and completion is shown in Figure 1 (see details by nursery in Table E2 ). A total of 125 children completed the vaccination protocol, and 120 completed all visits (six withdrew before or at the time of the first visit, two departed from the area during the study, and the others repeatedly refused sampling). The number of subjects recruited in each DCC ranged from 4 to 29. The median number of days after first vaccine dose at V2 sampling was 7 days for both groups (range, 5-26 d) and, at V3, 28 days (range, 27-43 d). The median durations after the second vaccine dose were (V4) 7 days (range, 6-16 d) and (V5) 28 days (range, 21-48 d). The control (late vaccine) group had a greater mean number of siblings, but otherwise the groups were similar following randomization (Table 3) . There was no evidence to suggest a difference in antibiotic use between the groups at baseline ( Changes in bacterial density were investigated in those children who were positive for carriage at baseline (V1). Among these children, there was no evidence to suggest a difference in mean S. pneumoniae density (GC/ml) between the study groups at baseline (V1) or 7 days (V2) after the intervention. However, at V3 (28 d after vaccination), a sixfold higher mean bacterial density was found in children positive for carriage in the vaccinated group, whose values had risen, compared with controls, whose values appeared to have fallen slightly over this period (Table 5 ). There was no evidence of a difference at either V2 or V3 (7 or 28 d after vaccination) for M. catarrhalis or H. influenzae. There were too few children with positive results for S. aureus at baseline to permit statistical analysis (n = 15), although there was a trend toward higher density carriage in vaccinees ( Figure E1 ).
 At the first visit, 45 children tested negative for carriage of S. pneumoniae (samples at V1 were unavailable for 9 children). Over the course of the study, 42 of these children subsequently tested positive, including 9 children before receiving a vaccine, 20 after receiving one dose, and 10 after receiving two doses; the 3 remaining children left the study. Similarly to the findings of the between-groups analysis, in the before versus after vaccine analysis across all visits, there was little to suggest any difference in carriage prevalence after vaccination (one or two doses of LAIV) for S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, or S. aureus (Table 1) . However, once again, there was evidence for an effect of vaccine to increase H. influenzae prevalence, with higher odds of carriage after both one and two doses of LAIV, after controlling for confounding Definition of abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; OR = odds ratio.

Estimates of arithmetic mean ratio allow for clustering by nursery (random effect, intercept) and so is not the simple quotient of the respective means. Too few children carried Staphylococcus aureus for statistical analysis. and allowing for clustering by nursery and repeated measures in children over time.
 Analyses of bacterial density were again restricted to those children with detectable carriage at baseline (to assess changes in density as opposed to acquisition). Again, there was evidence of an increase in S. pneumoniae density with increasing doses of vaccine. In particular, compared with prevaccine levels, a 2.5-fold increase in density was observed after two vaccine doses when samples were considered over all time points in the study ( Table 2 ). There was also evidence of vaccine-associated increases in M. catarrhalis density in carriers, with a more than doubling observed after the first vaccine dose. Although point estimates postvaccine were also raised relative to prevaccine values for H. influenzae, the confidence intervals were wide. Again, too few children were carriers of S. aureus to permit analysis of density using this approach. The relationship between nasal discharge score (Symptoms of Nasal Outflow Tally score) and bacterial density was investigated by including nasal discharge scores in the S. pneumoniae model, and evidence was found for an independent positive association with pneumococcal density (Table E3 ).
 To our knowledge, this study represents the first exploration of the effects of experimental respiratory viral infection on bacterial upper respiratory colonization in humans. We show that infections with attenuated viruses can result in increases in carriage density of common bacteria or increases in acquisition, raising the possibility that WT influenza and other viruses may have more marked such effects. Children carrying more bacteria are probably more infectious than those with fewer, and it makes biological sense that such bacteria should evolve to sense viral rhinitis or the host response to it and exploit it as a transmission opportunity. In addition to proliferating, bacteria might change phenotype to one better suited to successful transit. Our findings also suggest that LAIV could be used as an experimental tool with which to elucidate relationships between nasal bacterial abundance and transmission rates between children. Because the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines depends on their impact on bacterial transmission both within and beyond the pediatric population, there are good practical reasons why the biology of this process should be elucidated in detail. Does this study raise safety concerns about LAIV? We did not detect any safety signals associated with increased bacterial colonization density, but the study was not powered to do so. Upper respiratory carriage of bacteria is not an illness, and many authors assume it to be asymptomatic (22, 23) . We previously reported an association between carriage of H. influenzae and rhinitis in healthy children (4) , and in the present study we demonstrate an association for S. pneumoniae density independent of detectable viral nucleic acid and age. However, these symptoms are mild, and the vaccine has been studied in clinical trials (10) (11) (12) (13) . In addition, it has been widely used in children aged 2 years and older without any safety signals that one might attribute to higher bacterial density such as otitis media, pneumonia, or bacteremia, and overall the vaccine protects against the former (10). One might expect evolutionary pressures to select for bacteria that exploit the ubiquitous respiratory viral infections of early childhood to promote colonization and transmission while minimizing serious pathology in their hosts.
 An apparent short-term effect of LAIV on carriage prevalence of H. influenzae in the randomized comparison was confirmed in multivariable analysis, where it was also observed for the second vaccine dose. However, measurement of colonization rates with this and other bacterial species was not the primary study aim and absolute numbers of carriers constituting the difference were small, so it is possible that this finding may have occurred by chance. If it is a genuine increase in bacterial acquisition induced by the vaccine, it has echoes of the observation of pneumococcal acquisition in ferrets experimentally infected with influenza (2). In a recent adult pneumococcal challenge study, colonization was more likely in the presence of a respiratory virus (24) , although this was not associated with higher carriage density, possibly reflecting differences between adults and children. Confirmatory studies of acquisition of H. influenzae and other bacterial species are needed. A twofold rise in M. catarrhalis density was seen in the comparison of pre-and postvaccine doses but not in the randomized comparison, most likely due to a population average effect (specifically, the big impact of those with very high colonization densities). We also found that colonization at the time of vaccination was associated with greater overall rises in density, suggesting that increases in bacterial load were due not to acquisition of new strains but to proliferation of those already present (data not shown). This could be confirmed in future studies. We also found no effects of number of siblings (Table 3 ) on the observed differences between groups (data not shown). There were too few S. aureus carriers to analyze the effects of the vaccine on density, although we saw rises in density at V3 (28 d) apparently similar to those seen for S. pneumoniae ( Figure E1 ), observations that are concordant with those made in animal models (15) .
 More generally, the use of randomization and the blinding of the laboratory analysis make it unlikely that our results were subject to bias or confounding, and the size of the effects seen was sufficiently large to allow for possible biological effects on transmission rates. Although several bacterial species were studied, increasing the possibility of apparent differences arising by chance, individual upward trends were consistently seen, while secondary, larger, nonrandomized but conservative multivariable analysis reconfirmed the positive findings of the randomized comparisons and extended them to other species when potential confounding factors, in particular age and clustering by nurseries, were taken into account.
 The stepped wedge design that we used reduced the period over which randomized comparisons could be made but allowed more children and samples to be included in a confirmatory before versus after vaccine multivariate analysis and had the ethical and practical advantage of offering all participants protection against influenza. The higher dropout rate in the early vaccine group was evident mostly after the third visit ( Figure 1 ) and thus did not influence the findings of the between-groups analysis (V1-V3). That no placebo was used is a limitation, but an administration device identical to the vaccine could not be obtained. Less than 30% of the available parents consented to participate, which is high for a pediatric vaccine study but raises the possibility of selection bias. We could not collect information on parents who refused or on their children and so cannot exclude this possibility, but we have no reason to believe that our subjects were unrepresentative of the population.
 Our estimate of the effect of LAIV on bacterial carriage may be conservative. Available resources permitted us to conduct an individually randomized study. Through exposure to vaccinated children with elevated rates or density of colonization, control subjects may also have had their values elevated, diluting the observed effect of the intervention. Future confirmatory studies should preferably have a cluster randomized design.
 We detected and quantified speciesspecific bacterial DNA using PCR rather than viable bacteria by conventional culture techniques and thus, in part, detected DNA from nonviable organisms. Had cultures been done, doubtless some PCR-positive, culture-negative individuals would have been found. However, we have recently shown that individuals with discordant PCR and culture results tend to have low density colonization (16) . Although DNA may be present in the absence of living organisms, it nevertheless represents a footprint of recent bacterial presence, which is what this study was designed to measure. Nevertheless, it will be important to perform follow-up confirmatory studies and to elucidate how the bacterial density measurements we report here relate to efficiency of transmission between colonized children.
 On the basis of murine studies (15), our expectation was that changes in nasal bacterial colonization density would be evident around 7 days after immunization, and our observations of increases at 28 days were unexpected, raising questions about the time course of this effect in children. As no intermediate samples between 7 and 28 days were taken, nor were any taken more than 28 days after a vaccine dose, the timing of the peak of this effect remains unclear. Because bacteria can divide very rapidly, one can speculate that the time lag that rendered the density rise undetectable at 7 days, by when vaccine viral infection would have been well established, indicates that bacterial proliferation is triggered by the host response rather than by the viruses themselves. It is also possible that the usually asymptomatic infections caused by attenuated cold-adapted vaccine viral strains induce relatively slow, small bacterial responses that were hard to detect at the earlier time point. Future studies should include additional sampling times to clarify the duration of this effect and the timing of its peak.
 Although we present results on several bacterial species that commonly colonize children, we offer no information about serotypes of the studied species or the many others that are commonly present (25) . We are now undertaking further analysis of these samples using microbiomic techniques to further explore viral-bacterial interactions.
 In conclusion, we show that viral infections may induce species-specific changes in both bacterial density and acquisition and that it is important to study bacterial colonization as a continuous variable. Although not associated with disease, these effects may be important at the population level, especially in the context of more virulent WT respiratory virus infections, which may have potent effects on bacterial transmission between individuals. Nearly all childhood vaccination programs rely to an extent on the interruption of transmission of infections, so our findings should encourage further human studies of transmission dynamics. n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.",47599902cfeaaf5cea64838d8179f9ac326a38ea,2016-06-15,"Thors, Valtyr; Christensen, Hannah; Morales-Aza, Begonia; Vipond, Ian; Muir, Peter; Finn, Adam",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,10.1164/rccm.201510-2000oc,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,343.0,True,"Despite the important global public health burden of environmental viral infections, methods have not been fully developed and applied for describing the broad diversity of human viruses in environmental samples. Each viral type has unique infectious, structural, environmental transport, and environmental survival characteristics. In the U.S., the majority of biosolids (stabilized sewage sludge) are applied to agricultural land and approximately 75% of these are of class B status 7 . The independent identification of viral pathogen diversity in sewage sludge would represent a significant advance in the science of sewage sludge management. Summaries of the materials and methods for sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction and sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses are provided below. In-depth details of these methods are provided in the Supporting Information. Somatic and male-specific coliphages in the samples were cultured using U.S. EPA method 1602 13 via the dual agar method (see Supporting Information for details). Recovered DNA and cDNA was sent to the Yale University Center for Genome Analysis where the viral genomic DNA and cDNA were fragmented to ~200 bp (base pair) lengths and sequenced using the Illumina® HiSeq 2000 platform in three separate runs, generating both paired-end (2 runs) and single-end (1 run) 76 bp reads (see Supporting Information for details). In total, 12 samples were sequenced; ten representing the influent (I) and effluent (E) of the five digesters (A, B, C, D, E) and an additional set of true biological replicates of the digester B samples (BI2 and BE2). For each sample, this relative abundance is presented as the log 10 of reads mapped to a specific viral pathogen contig divided by the total reads in that sample. Assembled contigs are available via MG-RAST accession number 4497937.3. Finally, PCR of selected human viruses was used to validate metagenome annotation results. The master assembly, which incorporated sequence reads from all samples, produced 412,654 contigs longer than 200 bp ( Figure S1 , Table S2 ). Human pathogens comprised 0.1% of all contigs. These values are not quantitative on an absolute (i.e. per mass) basis; thus, reliable estimates of pathogen removal through the digester cannot be performed. To observe variations between influent and effluent viral populations for the different locations, viral pathogen populations are presented in a principle coordinate analysis using the Sorensen similarity index (Figure 3 ) 16 . It is both qualitatively and quantitatively evident from the scatter plots and line of best fit statistics that there is a high level of reproducibility (i.e. results are nonrandom) in metagenome annotation and sequencing. Pathogen annotations for the true biological replicates were highly reproducible. Results for RNA viruses consistently showed higher occurrence by PCR than sequencing. Two important, novel contributions can be drawn from this work's results. Both viruses are highly prevalent in the general population. Bocavirus is frequently the cause of respiratory disease in children, has been recently detected in raw wastewater and occurred in 90% of the samples considered in this study 23 . Klassevirus has recently been found to be globally widespread in sewage 27 . Finally, Cosavirus, a novel genus in the Picornaviridae family that was present in 25% of sludge samples in this study, has been recently identified in children with non-poliovirus acute flaccid paralysis in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and more recently in a minority of raw sewage samples from U.S. and European wastewater treatment facilities 23 . Plaque formation on BGM cell lines has been documented for Parechoviruses but not Klassevirus or Cosavirus 28 . Adenovirus and Norovirus are notable examples. The continuing trend of declining DNA sequencing costs should continue to enable and strengthen viral metagenomic approaches for revealing viral diversity 29 . Additional limitations to uncovering the full human virus diversity exist. While this problem is less severe for human pathogens due to high medical interest and also because genomes are now being produced for viruses that are not culturable (e.g. Klassevirus and Norovirus), there is still likely human pathogen diversity that is not represented in the viral genome database. Large percentages of illnesses are currently undiagnosed. These identifications demonstrate the need for developing an improved suite of indicator pathogens, and at a minimum, both DNA and RNA viruses, rather than just the RNA virus Enterovirus, must be considered in any future updates to sewage sludge regulation. More broadly, the viral metagenomics approaches applied here are reproducible and are applicable to any environmental sample where viral pathogen diversity may be a concern. However, viral metagenomics should be considered as an approach for revealing diversity, and should act as a basis for, rather than a substitute to, qPCR and culture-based monitoring.

59,59,135895ffa21a3c75c822f185f2072ba8a224fbcb,,Single particle assay of coronavirus membrane fusion with proteinaceous receptor-embedded supported bilayers,"Total internal reflection microscopy combined with microfluidics and supported bilayers is a powerful, single particle tracking (SPT) platform for host-pathogen membrane fusion studies. But one major inadequacy of this platform has been capturing the complexity of the cell membrane, including membrane proteins. Because of this, viruses requiring proteinaceous receptors, or other unknown cellular co-factors, have been precluded from study. Here we describe a general method to integrate proteinaceous receptors and cellular components into supported bilayers for SPT fusion studies. This method is general to any enveloped virus-host cell pair, but demonstrated here for feline coronavirus (FCoV). Supported bilayers are formed from mammalian cell membrane vesicles that express feline aminopeptidase N (the viral receptor) using a cell blebbing technique. SPT is then used to identify fusion intermediates and measure membrane fusion kinetics for FCoV. Overall, the fusion results recapitulate what is observed in vivo, that coronavirus entry requires binding to specific receptors, a low-pH environment, and that membrane fusion is receptorand protease-dependent. But this method also provides quantitative kinetic rate parameters for intermediate steps in the coronavirus fusion pathway, which to our knowledge have not been obtained before. Moreover, the platform offers versatile, precise control over the sequence of triggers for fusion; these triggers may define the fusion pathway, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity of coronaviruses. Systematically varying these triggers in this platform provides a new route to study how viruses rapidly adapt to other hosts, and to identify factors that led to the emergence of zoonotic viruses, such as human SARS-CoV and the newly emerging human MERS-CoV.","Coronaviruses are membrane-enveloped viruses that show a high degree of adaptability for infecting a wide range of host cells and different species. It is not well-understood how these viruses adapt to new hosts, yet they are an increasing concern as a source of emerging viruses for the human population, including SARS-CoV and the newly emerging MERS-CoV [1e3]. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV produce fatal disease in the majority of people who contract the infection. Quantitative studies of the entry process of the virus are therefore necessary for understanding the cues that mitigate host adaptation and for developing strategies to prevent infection. But accurately establishing the impact of various triggers on membrane fusion requires experimental techniques capable of quantifying fusion kinetics to characterize the fusion intermediates, the kinetic rate constants for transitional steps, and the fusion pathway.
 A relatively new approach for quantitatively studying viral entry kinetics is single particle imaging using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) [4] . TIRFM requires that a supported lipid bilayer (SLB) containing viral receptors is located within 100 nm of an evanescent wave produced by total internal reflection at the interface between two dissimilar materials. This requirement is easily achieved by coating the walls of a glass microfluidic channel with an SLB. SLBs preserve many properties of the cell membrane, like chemical tunability, lipid diversity, and mobility of its constituents in a planar geometry, but without the experimental complications imposed by live cells. However, a significant limitation of this platform has been capturing the complexity of cell membranes, especially the incorporation of membrane proteins. This limitation has precluded studies of viruses that use proteinaceous receptors (like coronaviruses) to date. As such, these platforms have been limited to the study of a few viruses, such as influenza virus [5e7], Sindbis virus [8] , and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [9] , because these viruses have either known glycolipid receptors or are known to interact with specific lipids that are easily incorporated into SLBs. Herein we describe a method to integrate the proteinaceous receptor for feline alphacoronavirus WSU 79-1683 (referred to here as FCoV) into a supported bilayer and measure membrane fusion kinetics using single particle tracking. Importantly, this new method of forming proteinaceous supported bilayers for virus fusion studies opens single particle fusion assays to any enveloped virus that binds to proteinaceous receptors.
 To initiate infection, coronaviruses typically engage specific proteinaceous receptors on the surface of host cells. The specificity of receptor binding is believed to be one of the key factors in the host range of a given coronavirus [10] . One of the best-characterized receptors is aminopeptidase N (APN), which is utilized by the majority of coronaviruses in the alphacoronavirus genus [11e13] . Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells are transfected with the feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) and encapsulated into vesicles using a cell blebbing technique [14e18] . These vesicles are then used to form proteinaceous supported bilayers to which coronavirus can fuse and be observed at the single particle level using TIRF microscopy. This method for creating proteoliposomes is in contrast to the usual approach to incorporate membrane proteins into vesicles, where proteins are reconstituted into proteoliposomes using detergent. Detergents solubilize the proteins out of the cell membrane and can result in loss of native conformation of the proteins. For pathogenesis, the conformation of proteins in the membrane and its glycosylation are critical to controlling the host-pathogen interaction. We show here that fAPN in the supported bilayer made from blebs is enzymatically active, oriented properly, and competent to bind FCoV prior to membrane fusion.
 Feline coronavirus was chosen for this work because it has a well-characterized receptor (APN), grows readily in cell culture, and is not infectious in humans. FCoV, therefore, serves as a safe and effective model virus to demonstrate the use of the single particle approach to characterize membrane fusion of a virus requiring a proteinaceous receptor.
 Like influenza virus, many coronaviruses can use the endocytic pathway to enter cells [19] . Once inside the endosome, the challenge for viruses is delivering their genetic material across the membrane and into the cytosol for viral replication. All enveloped viruses have membrane proteins that facilitate the fusion of their lipid envelope with the host cell membrane [20] . Coronavirus particles possess at their surface the spike (S) envelope glycoprotein, which is a class I fusion protein [21] . Whereas the structure and function of the prototypical class I fusion protein, influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), is well understood, structureefunction relationships for coronavirus S proteins are not well characterized. For coronaviruses, the S protein mediates virus entry and determines cell tropism and pathogenesis [22] . Like influenza virus HA, the coronavirus S protein has two primary functions: 1) it controls the binding of the virus to a cell membrane receptor, and 2) it mediates membrane fusion between the viral and host membranes [20] . In general, receptor binding is controlled by the S1 domain of the protein, while membrane fusion is mediated by the S2 domain. A conformational change in the S2 domain is believed to drive the viral membrane to fuse with the host membrane. For most coronaviruses, this conformational change is triggered by the acidification of the endosome, although pH-independent fusion can also be observed.
 It is generally believed that all class I fusion proteins follow a common fusion pathway that has been well-established in the prototypical class I influenza virus. Class I fusion proteins go through a multi-step process to achieve a fusion pore that begins with a fusion protein conformational change triggered by low pH. During the conformational change the fusion protein unfolds and thrusts the fusion peptide into the hydrophobic region of the host membrane. Next, the protein folds back, bringing the anchored membrane in close contact with the viral membrane until a stalklike structure is formed. The stalk structure results from the mixing of the outer leaflet of the host membrane with the viral membrane, referred to as hemifusion. After a short lag time, the stalk is converted into a fusion pore through which the viral contents can exit. It may be necessary for multiple fusion proteins to work in concert to bend the membrane to induce fusion.
 Analogous to influenza HA, it is believed that the coronavirus S protein, undergoes proteolytic cleavage prior to fusion activation [22] . Proteolytic cleavage is believed to expose specific regions of the S protein, including the fusion peptide [23] . Because proteolytic cleavage dictates fusion competency, the availability of proteases in the extracellular milieu is another key factor in tropism of coronavirus. A dramatic example of this is human SARS-CoV. The bound virus is able to fuse at the cell surface in absence of acidic pH, when exposed to exogenous proteases [24] . This route of entry may even be 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more efficient that the endosomal pathway [24] . In this case, proteolytic cleavage changed the fusion pathway. By combining single particle fusion with proteinaceous supported bilayers and microfluidics, the sequence of triggers can be controlled and the associated fusion pathway and kinetics quantitatively measured.
 Baby hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, CellGro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin and 10 mg/ml streptomycin (CellGro), 1% HEPES buffer (CellGro) in a 37 C, 5% CO 2 incubator. The pcDNA-fAPN and pCI-neo-hAPN plasmids were used for transfections of BHK-21 cells. They encode the feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) and human aminopeptidase N (hAPN), respectively, and are generous donations from Kathryn Holmes of the University of Colorado. pCAGGS-FCoV-1683 S plasmid encodes the S protein of FCoV-1683 [25] . The pCAGGS vector was used as an empty vector control.
 Feline Coronavirus (FCoV) strain WSU 79-1683, also referred to FCoV-1683, was obtained from the Cornell Animal Health Diagnostic Center (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). The virus was grown in canine A-72 cells provided by Dr. Colin Parish (Baker Institute of Animal Health, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY).
 The formation of cell blebs was established in the mid-1970's [14] . An excellent review of cell blebbing protocols is available in Ref. [17] . Here, we use a blebbing procedure published previously by our group [18] . For transfections, 1.5 Â 10 6 cells were seeded in 10 cm culture dishes, and incubated for 24 h. Transfections were performed using TurboFect transfection reagent (ThermoScientific) according to manufacturer's instructions and using 6 mg of plasmid DNA for each plate. Twentyfour hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with buffer A (2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.4). 3 ml of buffer B (2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES, 25 mM formaldehyde, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.4) was added to each dish to induce cell blebbing. The dishes were then incubated for 1 h at 37 C with gentle rocking. After incubation, the cell supernatant, containing detached cell blebs, was decanted into a 15 ml falcon tube and placed on ice for 20 min to allow any detached cells to settle out. The supernatant was transferred to new test tube. Blebs were then dialysed using cellulose dialysis tubing (Fischer Scientific), in two 100 ml volumes of buffer A for 24 h. The size of cell blebs was determined by dynamic light scattering using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano (Worcestershire, UK). The sample registered 3 peaks at approximately 38 nm, 106 nm, and 530 nm.
 The following lipids/materials were used in the experiments: 1-oleoyl-2palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-oleoyl-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), cholesterol, and sphingomyelin. These materials were all purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Oregon green DHPE purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) was used to label supported bilayers and as a pH sensor to mark acidification of the bilayer during membrane fusion experiments. Octadecyl Rhodamine (R18), a red-emitting, lipophilic fluorophore, was used to label cell bleb membranes and was purchased from Molecular Probes. We also synthesized in house a green-emitting, lipophilic fluorophore, Rhodamine 110 Octadecyl ester (R110C18), from Rhodamine 110 Chloride and 1-octadecanol purchased from SigmaeAldrich. The synthesis procedure has been published previously [7] . R110C18 was used to label viral membranes during dual-labeling virus fusion experiments. Sulforhodamine B (SRB), a red-emitting, water-soluble fluorophore purchased from Molecular Probes was used to label virus interiors.
 The liposome formulation used in these studies (BHK-liposome) contained POPC, POPE, sphingomyelin and cholesterol in the ratio 37.3:34.2:5.7:22.8. This composition was formulated to match the native lipid content of BHK cells as closely as possible [26] and primarily used in the formation of bleb-derived supported bilayers.
 To form liposomes, appropriate amounts of each component were mixed in biotechnology grade chloroform in a scintillation vial. For formulations containing sphingomyelin, this component was first dissolved in a 4:1 mixture of chloroform:methanol then added to the mixture. The bulk solvent was removed from the vial under a stream of high purity nitrogen gas and then placed in a desiccator under vacuum overnight to ensure complete evaporation of all solvent. Phosphatebuffered saline at pH 7.4 was added to the dried lipid film and gently resuspended in a sonication bath (Model # BD2500A-DTH; VWR) for 20 min on the lowest setting. The final lipid concentration was approximately 2 mg/ml. Liposomes were then extruded twice through a polycarbonate filter (Whatman Nucleopore) with pore size 100 nm, and five times through a filter with a pore size of 50 nm. The average liposome diameter for all formulations ranged between 90 and 100 nm as determined by dynamic light scattering.
 To visualize both the formation of the fAPN-bleb supported bilayer formation and viral membrane fusion, blebs and viruses were fluorescently labeled. To visualize fusion using a fluorescence dequenching technique, viral membranes must be labeled with a semi-quenched amount of fluorophores following standard procedures [27, 28] . In these experiments, FCoV was labeled with R110C18 according to the following general procedure. To fluorescently label FCoV membranes for fusion experiments, R110C18, dissolved in ethanol, was used. 5 ml of virus solution was diluted with 250 ml of buffer A and mixed with 3 ml of 2 mM R110C18 for 1 h in a sonicating bath. In this case, it is desired to label membranes with a quenched amount of R110C18 to trigger dequenching during membrane fusion. Free R110C18, which did not insert into the membranes, was removed from the solution by centrifuging (Eppendorf, Centrifuge 5451C, Hauppauge, NY) through a G-25 spin column for 2 min at rate of 3 Â 1000 min À1 . The supernatant containing the purified virus was diluted with 0.8 ml of buffer A and gently vortexed to mix.
 For pore formation experiments, 5 ml of virus solution was mixed with 10 ml of 20 mM Sulforhodamine B (SRB) solution and incubated overnight. Excess SRB, which did not partition into the virus interior, was removed from the solution by centrifuging through a using a G-25 spin column for 2 min at rate of 3 Â 1000 min À1 . The supernatant was diluted in 0.8 ml of buffer A prior to use.
 For FCoV hemifusion experiments, it was necessary to label the membrane with a green fluorophore to distinguish it from the red internal flouorophore label. For these experiments, virus that had been labeled with SRB as described in the previous section, was labeled with 3 ml of R110C18 (2 mM). The mixture was sonicated gently for 1 h and excess dye was removed as previously described using at G-25 spin column.
 Glass microscope coverslips (25 mm Â 25 mm; No. 1.5) from VWR were cleaned in piranha solution consisting of 70% sulfuric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide. Slides were immersed in 150 ml of piranha solution for 10 min then rinsed for 30 min with copious amounts of deionized water with a minimum resistance of 18.2 MU cm obtained from a Siemens Purelab Ultra water purification system. Clean slides were stored under deionized water and dried with a stream of ultra-pure nitrogen gas prior to use. For bilayer formation, glass surfaces were used either with PDMS wells or microfluidic devices.
 To form the PDMS wells, a thin sheet of PDMS was made in a Petri dish using 10:1 elastomer/crosslinker mixture of Sylgard 184 (Robert McKeown Company; Branchburg, NJ). The PDMS was baked for 3 h at 80 C, cut into small squares approximately the same size as a coverslip, and a hole punched through each square to form the wells. PDMS squares were then attached to a clean glass coverslips, which formed the bottom of the wells. The approximate volume of a well was 100 ml.
 Microfluidic devices for the fusion experiments were fabricated using soft lithography. The microchannel pattern was designed using the CAD software program L-Edit (Tanner EDA) and a master of the flow pattern was made on a silicon wafer at Cornell Nanoscale Science and Technology Facility (CNF). Each microfluidic device contained six channels. The dimensions of each channel are 1 mm wide by 70 mm deep with a total length of the channel of 1.5 cm. The spacing between the centers of each channel is 1 mm. The silicon wafer was coated with P-20 primer in a spin coater, followed by SPR220 (Megaposit) photo-resist. The wafer was baked for 90 s at 115 C and then exposed to UV light for 7.5 s in an ABM contact aligner to pattern the wafer with the flow cell design. Following this step, the wafer was baked again for 90 s at 115 C and then developed for 60 s in a Hamatech-Steag Wafer Processor. The pattern was then etched into the wafer using an Unaxis 770 Deep Si Etcher. The depth of the channel was determined using a Tencor P10 Profilometer.
 Microfluidic devices were formed using PDMS in a molding process. To facilitate the release of the cured PDMS after molding on the etched silicon master, the master slide was first coated with Sigmacote (Sigma). A 10:1 (elastomer/crosslinker) mixture of Sylgard 184 was mixed and then degassed before pouring on the silicon master slide etched with the flow cell pattern. The PDMS was then baked for 3 h at 80 C. After baking, PDMS microfluidic devices were peeled off of the wafer, and inlet and exit ports were punched in each channel of the device. Both the clean glass coverslip and PDMS mold were treated with oxygen plasma using a Harrick Plasma Cleaner (Model # PDC-32G; Ithaca, NY) at a pressure of 750 mm on the high setting for 25 s. Gently pressing the surfaces together resulted in a tight bond between the glass and PDMS and formed the four walls of the microfluidic channel.
 A solution containing a 1:4 dilution fAPN-blebs in buffer A was drawn into the microchannel at a flow rate of 30 ml/min for 1 min and incubated on the glass surface for 20 min. The microchannel was then rinsed with buffer A at 100 ml/min for 2 min.
 A solution of BHK-liposomes (0.5 mg/ml) was drawn into the microchannel at 100 ml/min for 1 min and incubated for 10 min. To heal any defects in the membrane, more vesicle solution was drawn into the microchannel at 10 ml/min for 5 min. Finally, the microchannel was rinsed with buffer A at 100 ml/min for 2 min to remove any excess liposomes.
 Integrity of bilayers and diffusion of the lipids within it was examined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Bilayers were formed following the above procedures inside PDMS wells. R18 was used to label the bilayer and carry out the photobleaching experiments. Once formed, bilayers were gently scratched with a dissection tool to remove a thin section to aid in focusing on the plane of the bilayer on the microscope. Following this step, the bilayer was rinsed again for 1 min with buffer A to wash out any lipids removed by scratching. A 20 mm diameter spot in the supported lipid bilayer was bleached with a 4.7 mW 488 nm krypton/argon laser for 200 ms. The recovery of the intensity of the photobleached spot was recorded for 15 min at regular intervals. The fluorescence intensity of the bleached spot was determined after background subtraction and normalization for each image. The recovery data was fit using a Bessel function following the method of Soumpasis [29] . The diffusion coefficient is then calculated using the following equation: D ¼ w 2 =4t 1=2 , where w is the full width at half-maximum of the Gaussian profile of the focused beam.
 For protein mobility, single particle tracking at 100Â magnification was conducted. Fluorescently labeled fAPN-specific antibodies (see next section for antibody and labeling details) were bound to fAPN in the bilayer and monitored for at least 40 min to determine if any proteins diffused during that time. Fig. S3 summarizes the protein mobility results.
 To confirm that fAPN proteins were incorporated into the supported bilayer and the active, extracellular end was oriented facing the bulk solution (i.e., not inverted towards the glass support), the bilayer was incubated with an fAPN-specific antibody, RG4 [30] (generously donated by Tsutomu Hohdatsu), which recognizes an epitope (residues 251e582) [12] located in the C-terminal ectodomain (extracellular-facing domain) of the protein. The bilayer was incubated with 1 mg/ml of a primary antibody anti-fAPN mouse monoclonal antibody (RG4) for 20 min. The unbound primary antibody was rinsed and 1 mg/ml of Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated-goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody was added and incubated for 20 min. Excess secondary antibody was rinsed and the sample was imaged on an inverted fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter set, described below.
 Many cells and species express aminopeptidase N. APN is a membrane-bound enzyme that cleaves the N-terminal amino acids from bioactive proteins, leading to their inactivation or degradation [31] . This function is believed to be integral to several biological processes including antigen processing and presentation, cell adhesion, tumor cell metastasis, neurotransmitter degradation. APN also serves as a well-characterized receptor for certain coronaviruses [32] , including FCoV-1683 [12] used in these experiments.
 To ensure the APN proteins maintain their native enzymatic functionality in the supported bilayers, we performed an enzymatic activity assay. In this assay, the substrate for APN is non-fluorescent until the enzyme cleaves it. Therefore, functionality of APN in blebs or supported bilayers can be verified by detecting fluorescence after introducing the substrate into a cuvette of bleb solution or into a microfluidic device containing supported bilayers. For these experiments, human APN (hAPN), instead of feline APN, was expressed in BHK cells and tested for activity. This change was necessary because there is no activity assay specific for the feline APN. The control cases are the empty vector blebs or empty vector-SB.
 Blebs containing human APN (hAPN) were formed as previously described for fAPN-blebs. The activity of hAPN and empty vector cell blebs in solution was tested using bulk fluorescence measurements in fluorometer (Photon Technologies International Inc) at an excitation/emission of 380/460 nm. The substrate for hAPN, H-Ala-AMC, was purchased from Bachem. A 50:50 mixture of blebs and H-Ala-AMC substrate at 270 mM in a 50 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.4 were mixed in a quartz cuvette and intensity of the mixture was monitored for 30 min.
 Bleb-derived supported bilayers containing hAPN were formed in microfluidic channels as previously described for fAPN-SBs. The substrate, at concentration of 270 mM in 50 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.4, was drawn into the channel at a flow rate of 100 ml/min for 2 min. The fluorescence intensity of the channel was observed at 10Â magnification at an excitation/emission of 380/455 nm. A control channel containing an empty vector bleb-derived supported bilayer devoid of exogenous APN proteins was subjected to the same conditions as described above. Fig. S5 summarizes the enzyme activity assay results. In Fig. S5a , blebs with and without hAPN were loaded into cuvettes and the fluorescence monitored temporally using a fluorometer after the substrate was added. The empty vector blebs show no appreciable fluorescence, while the hAPN blebs continue to increase in signal as increasing amount of substrate is cleaved during the course of the experiment. In Fig. S5b , supported bilayers with and without hAPN are loaded into a microfluidic channels with substrate. The microfluidic device is monitored at specific time points and the two channels are compared in the inset. In the control case, no fluorescence is detected above the background, but the hAPN-SB shows significant intensity after several hours.
 In order for class I fusion proteins to become fusion-competent, they must first be activated by proteolytic cleavage, a modification performed by cellular proteases. There are numerous enzymes capable of proteolytically cleaving the coronavirus spike protein. These proteases can be found in either the intra-or extra-cellular environment. For example, cathepsin proteases found in the endosomal compartment are naturally used to breakdown proteins taken up into the lysosome [33] . Once a virus gets endocytosed, cathepsins can also cleave the coronavirus spike protein [25,34e37] . Trypsin is a common extracellular protease found in the digestive tract of many vertebrates [38] to break down proteins during digestion [38] . We show here that trypsin is also capable of cleaving the spike protein of coronaviruses.
 Cleavage likely occurs at two distinct sites for coronavirus S: at the junction of the S1/S2 domains, as well as within the S2 domain (S2 0 ) [39] . Proteolytic cleavage is believed to expose specific regions of the S protein, including the fusion peptide [23] . For some coronaviruses, cleavage at S1/S2 is necessary to allow subsequent cleavage at S2 0 , and allow the S2 domain to respond a low pH trigger that initiates the conformational change required for fusion [39] . In other coronaviruses, in particular alphacoronaviruses, like FCoV-1683, the S1/S2 site does not need to be cleaved. In these cases, activation is likely mediated solely through the S2 0 cleavage site.
 We used trypsin as a means to activate FCoV-1683 S. To confirm that trypsin can proteolytically cleave FCoV-1683 S in an appropriate manner, FCoV-1683 viral suspensions were ultracentrifuged at 42,000 rpm in a TLA 55 rotor using an Optima Max-E ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) for 2 h at 4 C. The viral pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of PBS (non-treated sample), or PBS containing 3 mg/ml of L-1-Tosylamide-2phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (ThermoScientific) (trypsin treatment), or MES buffer pH 5.0 supplemented with 2.5 mM EDTA and 2 mM DTT and containing 0.5 mM Cathepsin B (Calbiochem). The samples were incubated at 37 C for 1 h, except the cathepsin-treated sample which was incubated for 15 min at 37 C. All samples were then subjected to treatment with the deglycosylating enzyme PNGase F (New England Biolabs), using 2500 units and supplied buffer at 37 C for 16 h. This was done to avoid having differentially glycosylated species of S protein. LDS loading buffer (Invitrogen) with DTT (50 mM final) was added to samples, and were subjected to 5 min 95 C incubation for denaturation. The samples were then analyzed by Western blot using FCoV-S-specific mouse mAb 22G6.4, provided by Dr. Ed Dubovi (Animal Health Diagnostic Center, New York State College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University) followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (AbCam).
 As shown in Fig. S6 , cathepsin B and trypsin treatment yield major cleavage products at approximately 100 kDa, while in the non-treated sample, the majority of S protein migrated as a single band around 200 kDa, indicating little cleavage event occurred without protease treatment. These results show that trypsin cleaves FCoV 1683 S in a similar way as does cathepsin B, and are consistent with published results for this virus cleaved with cathepsin B [25] .
 Membrane fusion assays were conducted with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy using an inverted Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 with a a Plan-Apochromat 100Â oil objective with a numerical aperture (NA) of 1.46. Indexmatching liquid (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) was used to couple the glass coverslip of the microfluidic device to the objective. In this setup, two lasers can be used simultaneously to excite different color fluorophores; we used 561 nm and 488 nm excitation wavelengths from solid-state lasers. These were coupled into the optical pathway of the microscope using a Laser TIRF 3 slider (Carl Zeiss, Inc.), which controlled the angles of incidence. Exceeding the critical angle for glass/water interface (w62 ) ensured total internal reflection of the lasers and created evanescent waves about 100 nm thick. At this thickness, the evanescent waves excited fluorophores positioned within the supported bilayer, or virions labeled R18. The excitation laser light was band-pass filtered through a Semrock 74 HE GFP/mRFP filter cube, and then combined with a dichroic mirror before being focused on the outer edge of the back aperture of the objective. The fluorescence emission signal was filtered through a 525/31 and 616/57 nm dual band-pass emission filter and then sent to an electron multiplying CCD camera (Hamamatsu ImageEM C9100-13, Bridgewater, NJ).
 The images acquired during the membrane fusion assays were analyzed using both ImageJ (NIH) and MATLAB (Mathworks). Fusing particles were manually selected in ImageJ and the fluorescence intensity in a 4 Â 4 pixel region around each particle was collected as a function of time. In videos where background noise was high due to a large amount of fusion events, a rolling ball background subtraction algorithm was applied to all of the images to remove excess background noise as the fluorophores diffused into the membrane after hemifusion. The rolling ball algorithm determines the local background for every pixel by averaging over a large circular region around the pixel. This background value is then subtracted from the original image. The fluorescence trajectories for the particles were then imported to MATLAB (Mathworks) for further analysis. A code written in MATLAB determined the onset time of the dequenching 'spike' for each particle by finding the time of the maximum intensity in each particle trajectory.

 The accuracy with which N and kH can be determined depends on both the number of experimental observations and the number of steps in the process [40] . To accurately estimate N from a gamma distribution a minimum number of a fusion events must occur for statistical significance. For example, to distinguish a 2-step process from a 3-step process i.e., N ¼ 2 from N ¼ 3, a minimum of 50 fusion events must be observed [40] . The number of fusion events that occurred during each experiment reported here varied from 70 to 120.
 Pure liposome solutions, prepared as described in the Methods section, self-assemble on glass to form supported bilayers via vesicle fusion [41, 42] . Proteoliposomes, on the other hand, generally do not readily form supported bilayers on their own. We discovered that proteoliposomes derived from cell blebs could be induced to form supported bilayers with the addition of pure liposomes [18] . We describe this self-assembly process here in the context of forming fAPN-supported bilayers (fAPN-SB) as substrates for FCoV fusion studies. The process is illustrated in Fig. 1 (top) and begins with the formation of cell blebs containing fAPN. The detailed procedure for forming cell blebs containing fAPN from BHK cells can be found in the Methods section. fAPN blebs are then used to form proteinaceous supported bilayers, as will be described in detail next. Once the proteinaceous supported bilayer is formed, FCoV binds to fAPN, localizing the virus within the evanescent wave and enabling single particle fusion experiments that will be described in a later section.
 To visualize the formation of the supported bilayer from fAPNblebs derived from BHK cells, the bleb membranes were labeled with a lipophilic fluorophore, Octadecyl Rhodamine (R18) (see Methods section). A small aliquot of the labeled bleb solution was added to a PDMS well and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. During this time, blebs contact and adsorb to the glass surface. Excess blebs that did not adsorb to the glass surface were removed by gently rinsing the well with buffer A (2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.4). At this stage, the adsorbed intact blebs stick to the glass surface as intact proteoliposomes, as seen in Fig. 1 , t ¼ 0 image, as punctuate spots.
 To induce the formation of a supported bilayer from the adsorbed blebs, we formulated liposomes to match closely the BHK endosomal membrane composition [26] (referred to as BHKliposome) and added this solution to the PDMS well containing the adsorbed blebs. In this experiment, the BHK-liposomes are devoid of fluorophore labels. This labeling scheme assists in observing the formation of the supported bilayer as the initially punctuate blebs rupture and the R18 disperses throughout the newly-formed planar bilayer (Fig. 1, bottom image series) . Note that as the R18 spreads in the bilayer and gets diluted with the unlabeled BHK lipids, the fluorescence signal increases due to fluorophore dequenching.
 Bilayer formation is verified by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). In this technique, a laser beam is used to photobleach a 20 mm diameter spot in the newly-formed fluorescently-labeled (R18) supported bilayer. The recovery of the fluorescence in this photobleached area is used to determine the 2D mobility of R18 embedded in the planar supported bilayer, which in turn, verifies that the R18 is no longer confined to discrete bleb vesicles adsorbed to the glass surface, but freely moving throughout a 2D bilayer plane. FRAP interrogates a macroscale area (wmicrons) and thus is useful for characterizing how well the bilayer has formed over this length scale. Note that the largest population of blebs is on the order of 500 nm in diameter (Fig. S1) , so if the blebs have not ruptured into a contiguous planar bilayer, then the fluorescence will not be able to recover after the sample is photobleached. This lack of recovery was confirmed by preparing samples containing only adsorbed cell blebs (no addition of BHKliposomes). Photobleached spots did not recover on these samples.
 For mobile samples, we obtain two quantitative measurements from these experiments: the mobile fraction and the 2D diffusion coefficient. Samples were prepared on glass surfaces in PDMS wells, as described above. Fig. 2 is a typical fluorescence recovery of R18 in a fAPN-SBs. From this plot, the recovery is nearly restored to 100%, indicating that the mobile fraction of R18 in the fAPN-SB is quite high. The reported diffusion coefficient, averaged over several, similarly-prepared samples, is 0.35 AE 0.005 mm 2 /s. Mobile fraction and diffusion coefficient values compare well with a control bilayer made of only R18-labeled BHK-liposomes (see Supplementary  Information for data, Fig. S2 ).
 Note that the recovery curve is smooth and fits well to the 2D diffusion model (black line). Irregular recovery could indicate either disconnected, isolated, bilayer patches that did not heal to form a contiguous film over this length scale, or the presence of lipid microdomain formation. This data indicates that the bilayer has a relatively uniform distribution and is contiguous. Other possibilities for the structure of the bilayer include partial bleb rupture (such as only the outer leaflet fusing to the BHK-liposomes). However, because the diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions in the pure BHK-liposome SLB and fAPN-SB bilayers are comparable, this structure can be ruled out by the following argument. If the blebs were only partially fused, then the R18 trapped in the inner leaflet could not readily exchange with the surrounding lipids after being photobleached. This behavior would manifest as a slower recovery and reduced mobile fraction, relative to the pure BHKliposome case, over the same timescale of recovery experiment. These images are all taken under 40Â magnification. The dark lines in each image are scratches intentionally made with a dissection tool that is used to find the focal plane of the bilayer. The continuous focus of this line throughout the rupture process indicates that the focal plane not change and that the uniform distribution of fluorescence at t ¼ 300 s is due to mobility of fluorophores redistributed throughout the newly-formed planar bilayer.
 Once the bilayer was formed, we verified that the fAPN proteins were incorporated into the supported bilayer and the active, extracellular end was oriented facing the bulk solution (i.e., not inverted towards the glass support) by labeling with a fAPNspecific antibody against the extracellular portion of the protein. Details of these experiments and controls are provided in the Methods section (Fig. S4) and confirm that fAPN is in the bilayer and oriented properly. Next, we tested APN activity in the blebs and support bilayers using an enzyme activity assay (see Methods section). Fig. S5 summarizes the enzyme activity assay, and the results show that APN is enzymatically active in the supported bilayer derived from cell blebs.
 Taken together, the antibody binding assay and the enzymatic assay results corroborate that APN protein is functional and maintains its native activity and orientation in the supported bilayer. We note that while the R18 and lipids are mobile in the fAPN-SB (Fig. 2) , the proteins do not appear to be mobile to the same extent (Fig. S3 ). Because APN is the binding receptor for the virus, immobility will reduce the strength of binding (avidity) of the virus to the supported bilayer. However, as long as one receptor bond in able to hold the virus in close proximity to the supported bilayer (and within the evanescent field) prior to fusion initiation, we can still track individual virus fusion events using TIRFM, as will be shown in the next section.
 We coated microfluidic channels with supported bilayers devoid of, or containing, fAPN. To make the bilayers, either empty-vector blebs or fAPN blebs were used, following the procedure described above for PDMS wells, but modified slightly to be compatible with a microfluidic device. A description of this procedure is in the Methods section.
 We prepared two suspensions of FCoV virus. The first was treated with the protease, trypsin, (2.5 mg/ml) for 15 min at 37 C prior to fluorescence labeling, and the second suspension was left untreated. Fig. S6 demonstrates, by Western blot analysis, that trypsin treatment of FCoV-1683 virions results in proper cleavage activation of the S protein. This cleavage step is necessary to prime the S protein for the fusion assay that will be carried out following virus binding. Next, suspensions of fluorescently-labeled, trypsin-treated FCoV were sent through the channels and incubated for 20 min. During this time, virus bound to the fAPN in the supported bilayer, but virus introduced to the channels containing empty-vector-SBs showed no visible binding (Fig. 3) . Comparing these results emphasizes the requirement that the supported bilayer contain fAPN to localize the virus at the bilayer surface.
 To monitor and distinguish the intermediate steps in the fusion pathway from each other in the single particle fusion assay, we use a dual-color labeling scheme (Fig. 4) , as described in the Methods section. Here, the viral membrane is labeled with a green-emitting, lipophilic fluorophore (R110C18), and the internal contents are labeled with a red-emitting fluorophore (SRB). With this scheme, hemifusion of the outer leaflets is marked by fluorescence dequenching of R110C18 when the outer leaflets mix. Pore formation is marked by a drop in SRB fluorescence at the fusion site, indicating release of the internal contents. These colors are co-localized in one particle by simultaneous monitoring of both emission wavelengths using TIRFM. In this way, three important time intervals can be obtained for each individual particle: 1) the time for the onset of hemifusion; 2) the lag time between hemifusion and pore formation; and 3) the time when the internal contents is released.
 In our assay, membrane fusion between bound trypsin-treated FCoV and supported bilayers is primarily initiated with acidic buffer, although on occasion, some cleaved viruses spontaneously fuse prior to acidification. To test the influence of triggering pH on The time at which acidification of the flow cell occurred was marked by an obvious decrease in fluorescence of the pH-sensitive fluorophore, Oregon green DHPE, present in the supported bilayers for this purpose. TIRFM images were collected at an interval of 100 ms for three or 4 min. A series of images of a single virion undergoing hemifusion triggered at pH 5.3 is provided in Fig. 5a . The dequenching spike is traced in the plot beneath the images. The time at which the onset of hemifusion occurs (following acidification at t ¼ 0) is declared as the start of the dequenching spike for each individual virus fusion event in the field of view. A cumulative distribution curve for each triggering pH was generated by plotting the frequency of hemifusion events as a function of the times of the onset of each hemifusion event. For a given triggering pH, a curve (like in Fig. 5b) is then fit with a cumulative gamma distribution (equation (1)) to estimate the kinetic parameters:
 where k H is the hemifusion rate constant, t is time, and N is an additional fit parameter, often correlated to the number of steps or the number of fusion proteins that act together to initiate fusion [5] .
 A gamma distribution is commonly used to fit single particle kinetics of membrane-enveloped viral fusion because individual fusion events occur independently of each other. The gamma distribution describes a multistep reaction scheme, where each step is a stochastic Poisson process with a rate constant k. This model has been used to analyze the kinetics of single particle influenza fusion [5, 7] , and because of the similarity between the class I fusion proteins of HA and S, this model is used to analyze coronavirus fusion here. The probability distribution was fit to our data using a nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm. Fig. 5ced summarizes the hemifusion kinetic parameters obtained for trypsin-treated FCoV over a range of triggering pH: 4.0 to 6.0. We note that at pH's above 6.0, the number of fusing particles was too low to obtain statistically significant kinetic parameters. The data presented here (pH 4.0e6.0) corresponds to experiments where at least 50 fusion events occurred. What is clear from this data is that FCoV-1683 S cleaved with trypsin requires at least a mildly an acidic environment to fuse, but the rate dependence on pH is negligible. This may indicate that there is a mildly acidic pH threshold at which FCoV-1683 S becomes fusogenically active. As such, we show here that acidic pH may be considered as a subtle trigger for fusion, along with the better characterized triggers of receptor binding and proteolytic processing of S.
 A second finding from these experiments is that trypsin can substitute for cathepsins in activating membrane fusion. In the absence of trypsin treatment, the total number of fusion events is less than 10% of the number of events that occur with treatment, post acidification (data not shown).
 A third finding is that protease activation can occur before the virus binds the APN receptor, in contrast to the situation with SARS-CoV where the virus must first be bound to the receptor before cleavage. It is interesting to note that FCoV-1683 is one of the coronaviruses that does not need to be cleaved at the S1/S2 junction, and so this result highlights that there may be differences in receptor priming of fusion, depending on how individual coronaviruses are proteolytically activated.
 The lag time between the onset of hemifusion and pore formation can be determined from the relative time stamps of the onset of hemifusion dequenching and the onset of the release of fluorophores initially inside the virion. In Fig. 6 , a series of images of a dual-labeled, trypsin-treated FCoV fusing to the supported bilayer is shown in Fig. 6a , with the intensity quantified in Fig. 6b . The initiating pH in this experiment was 4.5. In Fig. 6b it is straightforward to determine the lag time as a difference between the dequenching spike of the green label and the drop in fluorescence of the red label. Lag times for the virions in this sample are cataloged and plotted in the bar graph in Fig. 6c . Fitting this histogram with an exponential decay, we determine that the rate constant for the formation of the pore is 0.07 AE 0.01 s À1 . Pore formation was also conducted with an initiating pH of 5.0. Here the rate constant for the formation of the pore is w0.09 s À1 . For both initiating pH's, the transition to pore formation histogram fit best to a one-step process.
 These experiments reveal that FCoV exhibits a distinct hemifusion event before the release of internal label, which supports that coronavirus, like influenza, proceeds to pore formation via a stalk intermediate. No release of internal red label was observed prior to hemifusion of dual-labeled virions. class, influenza HA. In our previous single particle kinetics studies of influenza X-31 HA membrane fusion [7] , we found hemifusion and pore formation rate constants at pH 4.5 of k H w 0.2 s À1 and k pore w 0.08 s À1 , respectively. Here, for FCoV S at the same pH, we obtain k H w 0.05 s À1 and k pore w 0.07 s À1 , respectively. One main difference we observe between HA and S is the pH-dependence of the hemifusion rate constant. FCoV-1683 S apparently requires an acidic environment to fuse, but the rate dependence on pH is negligible. Influenza, on the other hand, exhibits pH-dependent k H [5, 7] . However, the pore formation kinetics for both viruses is approximately the same. This result is not surprising because the pore formation step is not believed to be pH dependent [43, 44] , but controlled to some extent by the physico-chemical properties (e.g., lipid composition, protein content, cholesterol quantity, etc.) of the membranes involved in fusion. Since cell blebs can be made from various cell types, the method presented here for forming supported bilayers from blebs also provides a new way to interrogate the impact of cell membrane type on viral fusion kinetics.
 A second difference between influenza HA and FCoV S is the value of N obtained from the kinetic analysis. N represents the number of steps in a multi-step scheme convoluted into a gamma distribution. In the case of influenza, N has been interpreted as the number of HA proteins that work in parallel to induce hemifusion [5, 7] . For influenza, N varies depending on the pH, but within the range of pH 4.0 to 6.0 is w3 using the same experimental acidification conditions employed in these studies. In the case of FCoV S, if this interpretation was used, our data indicates that on average 1e2 S proteins are required to induce hemifusion across the same pH range. For this interpretation, a single S protein appears to have more energy stored within it to induce fusion compared to HA. An alternative interpretation is that N in this case simply means that w1 step is dominating the kinetics, and that step apparently does not vary much with pH. Future experiments are required to shed more light on the mechanism of FCoV fusion and provide a conclusive interpretation of this parameter. Such studies are now ongoing in our laboratory.
 The formation of proteinaceous supported bilayers using the cell blebbing technique opens the possibility for quantitative characterization of membrane fusion kinetics of any enveloped virus that binds to membrane proteins in the host membrane (beyond coronaviruses) and also enables studies of unknown viral receptors in the cell membrane. Because supported bilayers can be made from many cell types [14, 17] , this method can be used to obtain kinetics of virus fusion as it depends on the kind of cell membrane host. In particular, for the many viruses that engage multiple receptors or co-receptors, this method allows the role of individual receptors to be defined in the context of the fusion event. Through biochemical means, proteins can be expressed or suppressed in the plasma cell membrane. Thus, supported bilayers can be tailor-made for fundamental studies of specific host-pathogen interactions that mitigate infection. In addition, by the incorporation of pseudoparticles [9] , the method may be expanded to study viruses of high biomedical importance that require enhanced biosafety procedures (BSL-3 and BSL-4).
 In this work, we obtain the membrane fusion kinetics of a lessstudied, but clinically important, class I fusion protein: coronavirus S. Overall, the fusion results here recapitulate what is observed in vivo, that coronavirus entry requires binding to specific receptors and that membrane fusion is both receptor-and proteasedependent. These results indicate that the in vitro method described here is a suitable substitute for studying fusion in vivo, but our method of creating and combining proteinaceous bilayers with single particle tracking, now provides a convenient way to obtain quantitative kinetic rate parameters for intermediate steps in the coronavirus fusion pathway, which to our knowledge have not been obtained before. The single particle approach combined with microfluidics offers versatile control over the sequence of triggers of binding, protease exposure, and acidification. Control of the sequence of these triggers is important, as the order may define the fusion pathway, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity of coronaviruses. Systematically varying these complex triggers using this platform provides a new way to study this virus's ability to rapidly adapt to other hosts. Versatile platforms are of critical importance to providing data that can be leveraged to limit the infection of the human population, especially in light of the recently-emerging strain of MERS-CoV. Green and red channel images of this virion undergoing hemifusion (green) and then pore formation (red). The arrows denote the virion being analyzed, which has both labels co-localized in one particle. In the red channel, a second particle is visible; however, during this span of time, it does not fuse. (b) The corresponding fluorescence intensity traces of the virion in (a). The lag time between hemifusion and pore formation for this virion is denoted by the black doubleended arrow. (c) Pore formation statistics at pH 4.5 taken from single particle fusion events, like those in (b). The bar graph shows the distribution of lag times between the hemifusion spike and the release of internal fluorescence for each dual-labeled fusing virus.

Such viruses require host cells to replicate and in most cases trigger innate and/or adaptive immune responses after entry into host cells. Thus, some of our discussion will be speculative by necessity. However, our aim is to provide a framework for thinking about virobiota-immune system interactions in mammalian hosts and to motivate experimental studies of these interactions. Phage populations diversify in the intestine as new members of the bacterial community are introduced, suggesting that phage diversity and bacterial diversity are linked 11 . Intestinal phages are genetically and morphologically heterogeneous. Although there is minimal variation of intestinal phage populations in individuals over time, there is substantial variation between individuals 5,6 , even when those individuals have similar bacterial community structures 9 . Bacterial acquisition of phage genes could modify the functional properties of the microbiota, thereby substantially impacting host metabolism and immunity. This was suggested by recent studies of Enterococcus faecalis V583, a commensal of the human intestine. Production of the phage particles confers an advantage to E. faecalis V583 in competition with closely related enterococcus strains. CRISPRs are genetic modules in which short repeats of foreign DNA are inserted between spacer sequences in the bacterial chromosome. The spacer sequences are transcribed into short complementary RNAs that target invading DNA for destruction. Like bacteriophages, populations of eukaryotic viruses in humans are heterogeneous, with distinct groups of viruses predominating in different tissues (Fig. For example, the virobiota associated with adult human skin swabs is composed almost exclusively of polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, a DNA virus associated with cutaneous cancer 7, 23 . These studies show a consistent presence of DNA from human herpes viruses and related viruses 24, 25 . Several studies of the human intestinal virome have suggested that eukaryotic viruses are rare relative to bacterial viruses 5, 6, 8 . Genetic signatures of many plant viruses have been detected in metagenomic studies of the human intestinal virome 5, 8 . Eukaryotic viral sequences are more prevalent in the intestines of diseased individuals. Furthermore, as noted above, it remains unclear whether the eukaryotic viruses associated with healthy human mucosal tissues are the result of chronic or latent infections or whether they arise from acute but transient viral infections. These findings suggest that virome expansion is linked to the pathology observed in AIDS and highlights the role of the immune system in controlling virus populations in the intestine. It is intriguing to consider that competition among bacteria in the lungs and the success of certain species based on the metabolic environment may modulate the composition of virobiota in the lungs, ultimately leading to progression of disease if host immunity is compromised. Some chronic viral infections lead to a decrease in host immunity that promotes immune suppression and greater susceptibility to infection. This suggests that when analyzing host immune status, composition of the resident viral community and the potential existence of chronically associated viruses must be considered. Finally, phage and their nucleic acids alter the expression of innate immune genes in mouse tissues 45, 46 . It is also interesting to consider whether bacteriophages might elicit antiviral innate immune responses. Mammalian cells are endowed with the ability to detect viral nucleic acids through several pattern-recognition receptors that are positioned to detect viral entry into cells (Fig. Under certain conditions, such as host immunodeficiency, commensal bacteria from the intestine can enter epithelial cells or become engulfed by phagocytic cells. In this way, bacteria could be delivery vehicles for phages that are sensed by the immune system. Human intestinal phages have diversity-generating mechanisms that may facilitate evasion of host adaptive immunity. Most of these hypervariable regions map to phage tail-fiber genes that are diversified to allow the encoded proteins to bind variable phage receptors 28 . Emerging information about the interactions between resident viruses and the immune system suggests that these interactions are as intricate and as coevolved as those involving the bacterial microbiota. It will be important to perform careful longitudinal studies of the viral populations associated with healthy human tissues to determine the stability of these populations and how they may evolve over time. Future work should also focus on exploring the extent to which resident phages and eukaryotic viruses activate host innate and adaptive immunity. Anatomical locations of resident viruses in humans. The human body is populated by resident viruses that include both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses. Studies that identified viruses in various host tissues are referenced. If intracellular phages are uncoated in the cytoplasm, the released nucleic acids could be sensed by the sensors cGAMP synthase (DNA) or RIG-I (RNA), which signal through stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), respectively."
