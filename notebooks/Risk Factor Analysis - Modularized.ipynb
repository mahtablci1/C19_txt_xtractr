    "## Team:\n",
    "#### We are a team of three: one machine learning/NLP scientist, one front-end senior software engineer and one co-op data science intern/engineer. We all work in the same place, Thomson Reuters, and that’s how we know each other.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"task\"></a>\n",
    "# Task: \n",
    "## What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors? \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"approach\"></a>\n",
    "## How we approached the challenge: \n",
    "Our platform was built based on the following principles: \n",
    "- Empower users (health researchers) to conduct literature survey efficiently. \n",
    "- Adaptable to future needs and challenges of health researchers.  \n",
    "- Modularized to have the capability of being improved and polished in a short time and in parallel.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"hypotheses\"></a>\n",
    "## Our hypotheses/why? \n",
    "\n",
    "AI can benefit researchers by extracting and visualizing information in the most efficient and relevant manner at scale.  In the absence of expert feedback and annotations, we have built/provided a platform that extracts and ranks relevant info with potential for improvement in the future by taking advantage of expert annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"solve\"></a>\n",
    "## How we solve it/why? \n",
    "\n",
    "The project was done in two slightly different approaches.  \n",
    "The first approach focused on developing an end to end pipeline to address the first subtask which was: \n",
    "- Data on potential risks factors \n",
    "- Smoking, pre-existing pulmonary disease \n",
    "- Co-infections (determine whether co-existing respiratory/viral infections make the virus more transmissible or virulent) and other co-    morbidities \n",
    "- Neonates and pregnant women \n",
    "- Socio-economic and behavioral factors to understand the economic impact of the virus and whether there were differences. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have developed a web app to visually accompany the analysis carried out for this task. \n",
    "The second approach was focused on question information retrieval but isn’t accompanied by with a web-app yet due to time constraint. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"first\"></a>\n",
    "## First approach has the following recipe: \n",
    "The platform is designed to visualize snippets of relevant topics through the following process: \n",
    "- Merge different sources of the data\n",
    "- Extract all COVID19 related papers \n",
    "- Expand and process the list of keywords\n",
    "- Find excerpts of papers that include the keywords \n",
    "- Rank the excerpts\n",
    "- Create an extractive summary for each paper\n",
    "- Serve it to the web-app for visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"second\"></a>\n",
    "## Second approach has the following recipe: \n",
    "The platform is designed to rank snippets of relevant topics through the following process: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Merge different sources of the data\n",
    "- Extract all COVID 19 related paper s\n",
    "- Convert a question into set of keywords (The questions are extracted from the [medical dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NoiAFJoydk3zuc-G0qqROarkhaGpfgbQhTVYhbYtLCM/edit#gid=0) shared with Kaggle participants.\n",
    "- Expand the list of keywords\n",
    "- Find excerpts of papers that include the keywords \n",
    "- Rank the excerpts\n",
    "- Create an extractive summary for each paper \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"pros\"></a>\n",
    "### Pros and Cons of our approach and platform: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The code base and the approach is highly modular and simple. It is a well structured baseleine to start.   \n",
    "- The code is very well documented \n",
    "- The visualization resonates with researchers. We interviewed an expert in epidemiology, since that is our target user. He liked all  aspects of it including the extractive summaries of the papers. He also noted that using this platform could reduce the time taken for a literature survey, which normally takes 3 to 4 months, to less than a month.  \n",
    "- The platform is taking a high recall approach to include everything \n",
    "- With a little bit of effort, we can convert this platform to an expert annotation platform where experts can interactively click on irrelevant sentences in the snippets and convert a completely unsupervised approach to a supervised learning task. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons: \n",
    "- The output wasn't reviewed and validated by a subject matter expert\n",
    "- Keyword search is not the most efficient search. Word embedding is known to be a better approach for text analysis but there wasn’t enough time to implement and evaluate that. \n",
    "- Our ranking follows a simple approach, where an expert should decide on the metric for ranking the importance of a snippet. \n",
    "- The second approach is not coming with a visualization. \n",
    "- There may be more risk factors than what we currently searched for and an algorithm should extract the unknown risks too. "

      "Diabetes is a chronic disease, which requires frequent visits to the physician for lifestyle advice and adjustment of treatment. Telemedicine can help the patients to get in touch with their physician from the comfort of their home, and away from hospitals which could increase chances of coronavirus infections. Physicians can interact with the patient, gather history, analyze their self-monitored blood glucose charts (SMBG) and self-monitored blood pressure (SMBP) values and give advice.\n",
      "The guidelines given by MOHFW 7 suggest video mode of communication for first consult however, in our opinion the first consult for patients with diabetes should ideally be face-to-face if possible, because physical examination cannot be replaced by telemedicine unless another healthcare worker in physical proximity to the patient can relay examination findings.\n",
      "Scientific studies support the usage of telemedicine in patients of diabetes. A metaanalysis of 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of telemedicine (video, phone and email) from China (involving a pooled population (n,3514) given telemedicine over 3-60 months) was done. This study showed a reduction in HbA1c by -0.37% (p <0.001) in telemedicine group when compared to controls. 11 In a Cochrane review done by Flodgren and colleagues 12 , 21 RCTs of patient with diabetes (n,2768) were analyzed. These patients had interactive telemedicine (remote monitoring or real time video) delivered in addition to, or as an alternative to, or partly substituted for standard care vs. standard care alone. This study showed that there was a reduction of HbA1c by -0.31% (p <0.001) in patients on telemedicine when compared with controls. In a recently published review of 46 studies, which included patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, n, 24000) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM n, 2052), different modes of telemedicine were studied. There was overall mean reduction in HbA1c in telemedicine intervention group in both T1DM (-0.12 to -0.86%) and T2DM (-0.01% to -1.13%) patients. 13 Research on telemedicine and diabetes in India is sparse. In a recently published article from our group, we have shown usage of customized mobile van with facility of telemedicine (use of computer and Skype video app to transmit retinal images to ophthalmologist and to consult with diabetes foot specialist and diabetologist at a tertiary care center) in underprivileged areas of Delhi. In this study, we showed success in screening and managing diabetes using telemedicine. 14\n"

      "Intubating a patient with COVID-19 is a high-risk procedure, due to the proximity of the health care workers to the patients' oropharynx and the exposure to airway secretions, which can carry a high viral load. 47 During the SARS outbreak in 2003, health care workers performing intubations were shown to be at a significantly increased risk of nosocomial transmission. 48 This risk was shown to be greatly reduced where PPE was used appropriately and infection control measures were followed. 10 The availability and suitability of facemasks and respirators has escalated into an emotive, as well as scientific debate. A fluid resistant surgical facemask protects the wearer against sprays of bodily fluids and large droplets, whereas N95, FFP2 and FFP3 respirators are thought to protect the wearer against aerosolised and airborne pathogens as well. In laboratory studies, a FFP2 mask filters at least 94% of all particles that are 0.3 microns in diameter or larger; N95 masks block at least 95%, \n",

      "While it is important to know which cytology specimens can contain viable and therefore transmissible virus, it is important to emphasize the use of universal standard precautions when dealing with any cytology specimen. From the experience with SARS we can extrapolate that SARS-CoV-2 can be present in fecal and urine samples, in addition to peripheral blood and respiratory samples. SARS-CoV-2 may be present in samples in patients without known COVID-19, in undiagnosed patients, in presymptomatic patients, in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections, and in convalescent patients, who may still be shedding the virus. From the available data it is very likely that many, if not most, infections occur through contact with individuals who either don't have the disease or were not diagnosed with COVID-19. In addition, as with most specimens, the clinical diagnosis may not be indicated in the requisition. For all these reasons, all fresh specimens should be considered po\n",

      "The novel nature of the COVID-19 pandemic presents many challenges to gynecologists working to optimize the care of their patients. No part of our practice has been more disrupted than the ability to offer timely procedures to our patients with gynecologic surgical indications.\n",
      "Despite efforts to limit elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, urgent and emergent procedures must still be performed. For many of these urgent procedures, such as ruptured ectopic pregnancy, hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, or ovarian torsion, laparoscopy may offer the best surgical approach and outcomes for the patient. However, some have suggested that laparoscopic procedures should be avoided, and laparotomy procedures be universally employed when a patient is COVID-19 positive or status is unknown due to concerns about aerosolization of viral particles via the pneumoperitoneum. We strongly disagree with this premise. Based on best available evidence, we concur with both the recent U.S. joint professional\n",

      "Coronaviruses are enveloped positive sense RNA viruses ranging from 60 nm to 140 nm in diameter with spike like projections on its surface giving it a crown like appearance under the electron microscope; hence the name coronavirus [3] . Four corona viruses namely HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43 have been in circulation in humans, and generally cause mild respiratory disease.\n",
      "There have been two events in the past two decades wherein crossover of animal betacorona viruses to humans has resulted in severe disease. The first such instance was in 2002-2003 when a new coronavirus of the β genera and with origin in bats crossed over to humans via the intermediary host of palm civet cats in the Guangdong province of China. This virus, designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus affected 8422 people mostly in China and Hong Kong and caused 916 deaths (mortality rate 11%) before being contained [4] . Almost a decade later in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\n",

      "Human to human transmission via either respiratory droplets or close contacts was initially proposed as the main routes of transmission of the pathogen based on experience gained in the previous two epidemics caused by coronaviruses (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) (8) . According to the world Health Organization (WHO) report, 2019-nCoV is a unique virus that causes respiratory disease, which spreads via oral and nasal droplets. Moreover, the pathogen of COVID-19 can float in the air in the form of aerosols and cause infection in healthy people (9) . Evidence of a study in Singapore revealed higher loads of virus in confirmed cases of COVID-19 in early stages of the disease, which decreased dramatically over time (10) . There is a limited number of evidence on oral-fecal transmissibility of the pathogen. However, COVID-19 RNA was found in fecal specimens of 2 to 10% of confirmed patients with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea (11, 12) , so fecal-oral transmission should be taken into a\n",
