In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission. Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0\u00b7001). SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days.\r\n Interpretation The consistent clinical progression, shifting radiological infiltrates, and an inverted V viral-load profile suggest that worsening in week 2 is unrelated to uncontrolled viral replication but may be related to immunopathological damage.","text_body":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new emerging disease that has affected many countries, with more than 3500 cases reported. A novel virus, the SARSassociated coronavirus, has been identified as the causal agent. [1] [2] [3] [4] The clinical, radiological, and other investigative findings at initial presentation have been previously described, [5] [6] [7] but the temporal progression is unclear. The routes and duration of viral shedding and the best clinical samples for diagnosis at different stages of the illness are also largely unknown. From March 24, 2003, a major outbreak of SARS involving 321 patients occurred in Amoy Gardens, a high-rise housing estate in Hong Kong. Epidemiological investigations suggested a point-source outbreak, which was linked to a faulty sewage system, initially contaminated by the excreta of the index case who visited the housing block on March 14 and 19. 8 The first 75 adult patients, belonging to 57 households, were admitted with a clinical diagnosis of SARS to one hospital. We did a prospective study on the clinical, haematological, radiological, and microbiological findings of these 75 patients over a period of 24 days, and correlated these findings with treatment 9,10 and with viral load in the nasopharyngeal aspirate to elucidate the pathogenesis and the impact of treatment. We report the usefulness of different clinical samples for virological diagnosis and its importance in transmission.\r\n Between March 24 and 28, 2003, we included 75 patients admitted to the United Christian Hospital from the Amoy Gardens housing estate who fulfilled the modified WHO definition of SARS. 3 Briefly, the case definition is: fever 38\u00baC or higher, cough or shortness of breath, new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography or highresolution CT in the absence of an alternative diagnosis to explain the clinical presentation. Patients were nursed in an isolation ward with other SARS patients.\r\n The study was approved by the ethics committee of the United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong. We entered on a predesigned database the daily clinical findings based on history and physical examination, oximetric measurement, and haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations. We collected nasopharyngeal aspirates and clotted blood for virological studies from all patients at presentation and on day 14 after the onset of illnesses. Anteroposterior chest radiography was done daily for each patient. All chest radiographs were jointly reported by specialist radiologists and respiratory physicians. We did high-resolution CT of the thorax for patients who had apparently normal, equivocal, or atypical chest radiographs. For patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with partial arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) less than 26\u00b76 kPa, 11 and recorded acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores. 12 From 20 patients in whom SARS-associated coronavirus RNA was detected by reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR in the initial nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, we collected further nasopharyngeal aspirates, urine, and faecal samples every 3 days. In 14 of these patients, quantitative PCR was done on the nasopharyngeal aspirates collected on days 5, 10, and 15 after onset of symptoms. The nasopharyngeal aspirates on admission were assessed by rapid immunofluorescent antigen detection for influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus, and were cultured for conventional respiratory pathogens on Mardin Darby Canine Kidney, LLC-Mk2, RDE, Hep-2, MRC-5, and fetal rhesus kidney (FRhK-4) cell lines. RT-PCR for SARS coronavirus was done directly on all clinical samples. Briefly, total RNA from clinical samples was reverse transcribed with random hexamers and cDNA was amplified with primers 5\u0408TACACACCTCAGCGTTG-3\u0408 and 5\u0408-CACGAAC GTGACGAAT-3\u0408. 3 For real-time quantitative PCR assays, cDNA was amplified in an SYBR Green I fluorescence reactions (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) as described. 13 Briefly, 20 L reaction mixtures containing 2 L cDNA, 3\u00b75 mmol\/L magnesium chloride, and 0\u00b725 mol\/L of the same forward and reversed primers as the reaction mixtures were thermal-cycled by a Light cycler (Roche, Mannheim; 95\u00baC, 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 95\u00baC, 10 min; 57\u00baC, 5 s; 72\u00baC, 9 s). Plasmids with the target sequence were used to generate the standard curve. At the end of the assay, PCR products (182 bp) were subjected to a melting curve analysis (65-95\u00baC, 0\u00b71\u00baC\/s) to find out the specificity of the assay. The acute and convalescent sera were tested in parallel for SARS-associated coronavirus IgG, with SARS-associatedcoronavirus-infected Vero cells fixed in acetone in an indirect immunofluorescent format. We investigated blood, sputum or endotracheal aspirates, and urine bacteriologically, as clinically indicated. All patients had sepsis work up on admission and if fever recurred. Stools were sent for routine bacteriological culture, Clostridium difficile cytotoxin assay, and examined for parasites in selected patients.\r\n All patients were treated with 1\u00b72 g intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate every 8 h, and 500 mg oral azithromycin daily. In patients with a known penicillin allergy, we administered 500 mg oral levofloxacin every 24 h. As soon as the diagnosis of SARS was established, 8 mg\/kg intravenous ribavirin every 8 h for 14 days, and a tailing regimen of hydrocortisone (starting dose 200 mg intravenously every 8 h) over 10 days, followed by oral prednisolone for 11 days (1 mg\/kg for 5 days, 0\u00b75 mg\/kg for 3 days, and 0\u00b725 mg\/kg for 3 days) were given. We used pulses of methylprednisolone 500 mg intravenously daily for two or three doses if patients worsened, with increasing shortness of breath, oxygen desaturation, and radiological worsening. All HBsAg-positive patients were given 100 mg oral lamivudine daily while taking corticosteroids.\r\n We compared risk factors associated with the development of ARDS by Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Student's t test for continuous variables. Significant risk factors identified on univariate analyses were further analysed by multiple logistic regressions to identify independent risk factors associated with the development of ARDS. We took p<0\u00b705 to be significant. We used SPSS (version 11.0) for all analyses.\r\n The sponsors of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or in the writing of the report.\r\n Of the 75 patients, 71 (95%) were ethnic Chinese, and the remainder were Filipino. The male-to-female ratio was one to 0\u00b792, and mean age was 39\u00b78 (SD 12\u00b72) years. Five patients were smokers. Underlying diseases were identified in 13 patients, including nine patients positive for HBsAg with no stigmata of chronic liver disease and normal liver function tests. The clinical symptoms on admission included fever in 75 (100%) patients, chills in 49 (65%), rigors in 42 (56%), myalgia in 51 (68%), cough in 22 (29%), sore throat in eight (11%), shortness of breath in three (4%), headache in 11 (15%), dizziness in three (4%), and diarrhoea in one (1%).\r\n Initial chest radiograph was abnormal in 53 (71%) patients; involvement was confined to one lung zone in 37 (49%) and was multizonal in 16 (21%). Lower-zone infiltrates or consolidation occurred in 45 (60%) patients. Initial high-resolution CT was done in 33 (44%) patients in whom the initial chest radiographs were normal, equivocal, or atypical. Of these 33 patients, 18 (55%) had abnormalities confined to one lobe. Multilobar involvement was seen in 15 (46%) patients. Focal ground-glass opacification was the only type of abnormality in eight (24%) patients. 12 (36%) patients had consolidation only, and 13 (39%) had both types of infiltrates.\r\n On haematological and biochemical investigation, anaemia was detected in six (8%), leucopenia in five (7%), severe lymphopenia of less than 1\u03eb10 9 \/L in 56 (75%), and thrombocytopenia in 28 (37%). Raised values were seen for alanine aminotransferase (42-343 U\/L), aspartate aminotransferase (39-302 U\/L), and creatinine kinase (176-1466 U\/L) in 22 (29%), 24 (32%), and 27 (36%) patients, respectively. The median lymphocyte counts decreased from 0\u00b78\u03eb10 9 \/L (IQR 0\u00b76-1\u00b71) on admission to 0\u00b76\u03eb10 9 \/L (0\u00b75-0\u00b79), 0\u00b74\u03eb10 9 \/L (0\u00b73-0\u00b75), and 0\u00b74\u03eb10 9 \/L (0\u00b73-0\u00b76) at days 7, 14, and 21, respectively.\r\n In terms of disease progression, all except one patient became afebrile within 48 h with the standard treatment protocol, but the fever recurred in 64 (85%) patients at a mean of 8\u00b79 days (SD 3\u00b71). Only ten of these patients had positive findings on sepsis work up: three had Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteraemia, four had clinical evidence of catheter-related sepsis, and three had nosocomial pneumonia due to Klebsiella pneumoniae (in two) and Escherichia coli (one). All these septic episodes responded to the appropriate antimicrobial treatment and removal of infected catheters. In the remaining 54 patients, fever recurred after a mean of 8\u00b70 (2\u00b71) days, which was unlikely to be caused by hospital-acquired infection. Between days 13 and 15, 17 (23%) patients developed another episode of fever (figure 1).\r\n Watery diarrhoea developed in 55 (73%) patients, with onset at a mean of 7\u00b75 (2\u00b73) days. The rate of diarrhoea peaked at a mean of 8\u00b77 (2\u00b73) days, with a maximum frequency of 6\u00b73 (3\u00b75) times daily (figure 1). Work up for diarrhoeal pathogens, including C difficile cytotoxin, was negative in all these patients. The mean duration of diarrhoea was 3\u00b79 (2\u00b73) days. Simultaneous occurrence of fever and diarrhoea occurred in 24 (32%) patients. Concomitant fever, diarrhoea, and radiological worsening occurred in 16 (21%) patients. Improvement of diarrhoea occurred in all patients by day 13.\r\n Radiological worsening was noted in 60 (80%) patients at a mean of 7\u00b74 (2\u00b72) days: 34 (45%) developed shifting of radiological lesions, evidenced by improvement of original lesions followed by the appearance of new lesions (figure 2); worsening of original lesions with or without (12) 0\u00b779 concentration (g\/L) Mean (SD) initial total peripheral 7\u00b71 (2\u00b71) 6\u00b71 (2\u00b71) 0\u00b709 white blood cell count (\u03eb10 9 \/L) Mean (SD) initial lymphocyte 1\u00b71 (0\u00b79) 0\u00b79 (0\u00b74) 0\u00b719 count (\u03eb10 9 \/L) Mean (SD) initial platelet 163 (56) 167 (41) 0\u00b777 count (\u03eb10 9 \/L) figure 2 . 33 (44%) patients developed arterial oxygen desaturation of less than 90% at room air, at a mean of 9\u00b71 (4\u00b72) days after onset of symptoms (figure 1). 24 (32%) patients required intensive care at a mean of 11\u00b70 (6\u00b74) days, among whom 19 had to be intubated at a mean of 12\u00b79 (6\u00b74) days. 15 (20%) patients progressed to ARDS and required mechanical ventilation. On day 1 of mechanical ventilation for ARDS, the mean PaO 2 -to-FiO 2 ratio was 14\u00b77 kPa (10\u00b78) and the mean APACHE II score was 22\u00b73 (5\u00b78). Time to occurrence of ARDS showed a bimodal pattern, with one peak at 11\u00b70 days and another peak at 20\u00b70 days (figure 1). Seven patients developed hospital-acquired infection during their stay in the intensive-care unit, including hospital-acquired pneumonia in three, meticillinresistant Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteraemia in one, and clinical sepsis in three, without positive cultures.\r\n On univariate analysis, the risk factors associated with ARDS requiring ventilatory support and intensive care were age, male sex, chronic hepatitis B virus carriage, raised creatinine, and recurrence of fever (table 1). Lymphocyte counts of ARDS patients on days 7, 14, and 21 did not differ significantly from those in non-ARDS patients. On multivariate analysis, only age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection were significant risk factors (table 2) .\r\n The mean length of stay for 75 patients was 22\u00b71 (3\u00b71) days, whereas for the 15 patients who developed ARDS, the mean length of stay was 26\u00b78 days at the time of writing. Five patients died during the study period, of whom two, aged 79 and 64 years, had succumbed to acute myocardial infarction on days 13 and 17, respectively. One patient died of clinical sepsis on day 23. Another two patients died of clinical sepsis and ARDS on days 24 and 25, respectively. 27 (36%) of patients were discharged home or transferred to a rehabilitation facility. One patient was transferred to a specialised obstetric unit for urgent delivery of a baby at 32 weeks' gestation. For the 42 patients who remained in the hospital, 13 were treated in intensive care for ARDS (table 3) The 20 patients initially documented to have SARSassociated coronavirus RNA in the nasopharyngeal aspirates on RT-PCR were serially followed up with sequential samples; the virological profile is shown in table 4. Quantitative RT-PCR of the nasopharyngeal aspirates showed an inverted V pattern, with mean geometric viral loads of 2\u00b73\u03eb10 5 copies per mL, and 1\u00b79\u03eb10 7 copies per mL, and 9\u00b78\u03eb10 4 copies per mL on days 5, 10, and 15, respectively, after onset of symptoms ( figure 4 ).\r\n Studies on SARS have generally been retrospective or limited to the description of the initial clinical, haematological, radiological and microbiological findings. The patients we studied, however, were residents of a housing estate placed under closed surveillance by the Department of Health soon after identification of the outbreak. All residents underwent frequent health checks, and symptomatic patients were admitted to hospital soon after the onset of symptoms and, thus, were admitted early in the course of the illness. Therefore, we were able to do a prospective study in a large cohort of patients infected in one community outbreak of SARS who were epidemiologically linked, and of whom most had virologically confirmed SARS-associated coronavirus.\r\n The clinical progression of SARS was mostly uniform in our cohort, with a tri-phasic pattern. Week 1 was characterised by fever, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms that generally improve after a few days. The increasing viral load during this phase suggests that the symptoms are largely related to the effect of viral replication and cytolysis. As the disease progressed into week 2, the patients frequently had recurrence of fever, onset of diarrhoea, and oxygen desaturation. Strikingly, nearly half the patients had shifting radiographic shadows. If viralinduced damage was the primary pathological mechanism, such a flitting pattern of radiological change is difficult to explain. The timing of the IgG seroconversion, which starts on day 10, seems to correlate with falls in viral load, which occurs from between day 10 and 15, despite the use of pulse methylprednisolone. Severe clinical worsening also occurs at this time, which cannot be explained by uncontrolled viral replication. This finding is supported by the progressive decrease in rates of viral shedding from nasopharynx, stool, and urine from day 10 to 21 after onset of symptoms in the 20 patients who underwent prospective follow-up with RT-PCR. Taken together, these findings suggest that the lung damage at this phase is related to immunopathological damage as a result of an overexuberant host response, rather than uncontrolled viral replication. 20% of patients in this cohort progressed to the third phase, characterised by ARDS necessitating ventilatory support. Inevitably, several patients developed nosocomial sepsis during this phase of end-organ damage and severe lymphopenia.\r\n In terms of pathogenesis, in pulmonary reovirus infection in athymic mice, a lower plaque-forming value of 10 6 is associated with pathological changes of bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia, whereas a higher inoculum of 10 7 is associated with ARDS. 14 To lessen the risk of progression to the chronic phase of ARDS, an effective antiviral to reduce the viral load may be important. At the time of writing, no antiviral is reported to be clinically effective for the treatment of this novel coronavirus. Ribavirin has broad-spectrum antiviral activities and is effective for the treatment of fulminant hepatitis in mice caused by the mouse hepatitis coronavirus. 15 Although the inhibitory activity of ribavirin against mouse hepatitis coronavirus is weak, ribavirin can decrease the release of proinflammatory cytokines from the macrophages of mice. It also switched the immune response of the mice from a Thelper-2 to a T-helper-1 response. Thus, irrespective of its antiviral role, ribavirin may act as an immunomodulator. An effective antiviral agent is needed because decreasing the initial cytolytic damage and viral load in the first phase may in turn result in decreased immunopathological damage during the second phase. Since a notable proportion of our patients developed ARDS, the role of immunologically directed strategies, such as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, IgM-enriched immunoglobulin, convalescent plasma, and the antitumour necrosis factor thymosin, deserve further investigation.\r\n Unexpectedly, chronic hepatitis B infection was an important independent risk factor for progression to ARDS. This finding may also explain a higher rate of death among young Chinese patients because of the high rate of chronic hepatitis B infection in Southern China. The finding is important because in all our patients, lamivudine was given as prophylaxis while the patients were taking corticosteroids. We did not assess the viral load for hepatitis B virus DNA since the liver function tests were normal with no clinical stigmata of chronic liver diseases. Thus these patients' poor 16 The case definition of SARS is clinical and rather nonspecific in the absence of epidemiological history of contact. We showed that IgG seroconversion has 93% sensitivity at day 28, even despite corticosteroid treatment. In this case, IgG isotype-specific antibody to the SARS coronavirus was tested for. If antibody to all immunoglobulin classes is assayed for, seroconversion will probably be detected earlier.\r\n Although viral RNA detection in the nasopharyngeal aspirate has a sensitivity of only 32% at presentation, testing of multiple nasopharyngeal and faecal samples increased the sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay.\r\n The presence of virus in the stool is an important finding because it suggests the possibility of oral-faecal transmission. The epidemiological investigation of the Amoy Gardens SARS outbreak suggested that the outbreak was caused by a faulty sewage system. 8 Diarrhoea seemed more prominent in our cohort of patients than previously reported, 3, 7 and the severe watery diarrhoea in these patients presented a challenge to health-care workers for infection control. Whether this apparent change in the clinical presentation is related to the difference in the route of infection or a mutation in the virus is still conjectural. Importantly, the mortality rate of 6\u00b77% we reported is higher than the previously reported figure of 3\u00b75% at day 21. 6 We noted the absence of a relation between the high rate of spontaneous pneumomediastinum unrelated to intubation and positive-pressure ventilation. This phenomenon is rarely reported in advanced cytomegalovirus pneumonia, 17 and influenza bronchiolitis, 18 whereas spontaneous pneumothorax is commonly reported in Pneumocystis carinii, and Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. The initial radiographic lesions in SARS were pleural based. 6 In patients in whom the initial consolidation is abutting on to the mediastinum, adhesions and cyst formation might occur at the interface between the mediastinal pleura and the pulmonary pleura. Any rupture of these cysts will result in spontaneous pneumomediastinum. Alternatively, a diffuse peripheral pneumonic changes followed by pleural adhesion may occur over the parietal pleura of the chest walls, which leaves the mediastinal sites as the area in which rupture of cyst can occur. This will also create the necessary setting for spontaneous pneumomediastinum to occur without spontaneous pneumothorax.\r\n RT-PCR on respiratory and faecal samples, together with serology, can confirm the diagnosis of SARS-associated coronavirus infection in most SARS patients. The progression of the disease to respiratory failure might not be associated with uncontrolled viral replication, but may, in fact, be immunopathological in nature.

We report the usefulness of different clinical samples for virological diagnosis and its importance in transmission. Between March 24 and 28, 2003, we included 75 patients admitted to the United Christian Hospital from the Amoy Gardens housing estate who fulfilled the modified WHO definition of SARS. We entered on a predesigned database the daily clinical findings based on history and physical examination, oximetric measurement, and haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations. Anteroposterior chest radiography was done daily for each patient. All chest radiographs were jointly reported by specialist radiologists and respiratory physicians. The nasopharyngeal aspirates on admission were assessed by rapid immunofluorescent antigen detection for influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus, and were cultured for conventional respiratory pathogens on Mardin Darby Canine Kidney, LLC-Mk2, RDE, Hep-2, MRC-5, and fetal rhesus kidney (FRhK-4) cell lines. 13 Briefly, 20 L reaction mixtures containing 2 L cDNA, 3\u00b75 mmol\/L magnesium chloride, and 0\u00b725 mol\/L of the same forward and reversed primers as the reaction mixtures were thermal-cycled by a Light cycler (Roche, Mannheim; 95\u00baC, 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 95\u00baC, 10 min; 57\u00baC, 5 s; 72\u00baC, 9 s). Plasmids with the target sequence were used to generate the standard curve. All patients had sepsis work up on admission and if fever recurred. All HBsAg-positive patients were given 100 mg oral lamivudine daily while taking corticosteroids. We compared risk factors associated with the development of ARDS by Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Student's t test for continuous variables. We used SPSS (version 11.0) for all analyses. The sponsors of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or in the writing of the report. Underlying diseases were identified in 13 patients, including nine patients positive for HBsAg with no stigmata of chronic liver disease and normal liver function tests. Initial high-resolution CT was done in 33 (44%) patients in whom the initial chest radiographs were normal, equivocal, or atypical. Only ten of these patients had positive findings on sepsis work up: three had Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteraemia, four had clinical evidence of catheter-related sepsis, and three had nosocomial pneumonia due to Klebsiella pneumoniae (in two) and Escherichia coli (one). In the remaining 54 patients, fever recurred after a mean of 8\u00b70 (2\u00b71) days, which was unlikely to be caused by hospital-acquired infection. Watery diarrhoea developed in 55 (73%) patients, with onset at a mean of 7\u00b75 (2\u00b73) days. Simultaneous occurrence of fever and diarrhoea occurred in 24 (32%) patients. Improvement of diarrhoea occurred in all patients by day 13. Radiological worsening was noted in 60 (80%) patients at a mean of 7\u00b74 (2\u00b72) days: 34 (45%) developed shifting of radiological lesions, evidenced by improvement of original lesions followed by the appearance of new lesions (figure 2); worsening of original lesions with or without (12) 0\u00b779 concentration (g\/L) Mean (SD) initial total peripheral 7\u00b71 (2\u00b71) 6\u00b71 (2\u00b71) 0\u00b709 white blood cell count (\u03eb10 9 \/L) Mean (SD) initial lymphocyte 1\u00b71 (0\u00b79) 0\u00b79 (0\u00b74) 0\u00b719 count (\u03eb10 9 \/L) Mean (SD) initial platelet 163 (56) 167 (41) 0\u00b777 count (\u03eb10 9 \/L) figure 2 .

For the 42 patients who remained in the hospital, 13 were treated in intensive care for ARDS (table 3) The 20 patients initially documented to have SARSassociated coronavirus RNA in the nasopharyngeal aspirates on RT-PCR were serially followed up with sequential samples; the virological profile is shown in table 4. As the disease progressed into week 2, the patients frequently had recurrence of fever, onset of diarrhoea, and oxygen desaturation. 20% of patients in this cohort progressed to the third phase, characterised by ARDS necessitating ventilatory support. 14 To lessen the risk of progression to the chronic phase of ARDS, an effective antiviral to reduce the viral load may be important. Unexpectedly, chronic hepatitis B infection was an important independent risk factor for progression to ARDS. In this case, IgG isotype-specific antibody to the SARS coronavirus was tested for. Although viral RNA detection in the nasopharyngeal aspirate has a sensitivity of only 32% at presentation, testing of multiple nasopharyngeal and faecal samples increased the sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay. The initial radiographic lesions in SARS were pleural based. Any rupture of these cysts will result in spontaneous pneumomediastinum. Alternatively, a diffuse peripheral pneumonic changes followed by pleural adhesion may occur over the parietal pleura of the chest walls, which leaves the mediastinal sites as the area in which rupture of cyst can occur."},{"Unnamed: 0":2,"Unnamed: 0.1":2,"doc_id":"056610b4981cee0efc485ed3f978f541fbe55f54","title":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome","abstract":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome presents as hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates on chest imaging in the absence of heart failure suffi cient to account for this clinical state.

This syndrome presents as acute hypoxaemia with bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates on chest imaging, which are not wholly due to heart failure. As a syndrome, it is characterised by the presence of several criteria. Since the original description by Ashbaugh and colleagues in 1967, 1 four defi nitions have been used to determine the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (table) . [2] [3] [4] [5] The American European Consensus Conference defi nition, 3 which was published in 1994, was the fi rst agreed and widely used defi nition. However, it had numerous limitations across all four diagnostic criteria (panel), and, as a result, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine engaged in a consensus process to generate an improved defi nition for acute respiratory distress syndrome. The Berlin defi nition, 5 which was published in 2012, was validated in over 4000 patients' data: on the basis of hypoxaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome is classifi ed as mild (ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO 2 \/FiO 2 ] of 200-\u2264300 mm Hg), moderate (PaO 2 \/FiO 2 100-\u2264200 mm Hg), or severe (PaO 2 \/FiO 2 \u2264100 mm Hg). The most important updates to the defi nition are the stipulation of a minimum positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H 2 O, (PEEP can increase oxygenation, which is a key criterion of the syndrome-this update was to establish a minimum standard for mechanical ventilation); the acknowledgment that acute respiratory distress syndrome can be diagnosed in the presence of cardiac failure; a requirement for new respiratory failure, or worsening of chronic respiratory disease, within 7 days; and the inclusion of chest CT as an alternative form of imaging for the demonstration of lung infi ltrates.\r\n The landmark ARMA study, 28 which was published in 2000, demonstrated the benefi ts of a low-tidal-volume, low-airway-pressure ventilatory strategy in acute respiratory distress syndrome and marked the establishment of lung protective ventilation as the standard of care. Despite this advance, the syndrome remains highly prevalent, with, in the lung-protective era, estimated incidences per 100 000 patients per year of 34 in the USA 29 and approximately fi ve to seven in Europe. [30] [31] [32] Its epidemiology is probably under-reported in less developed health-care systems, in which, as a result of resource limitations, few patients meet the current defi nition for diagnosis, despite 4% of all hospital admissions having a clinical state similar to that of acute respiratory distress syndrome. 33 7% of patients in the intensive-care unit (ICU), and 16% of those receiving mechanical ventilation, have acute respiratory distress syndrome. 34 Based on control group survival in randomised controlled trials [35] [36] [37] [38] published in the past 3 years, 28 day mortality is approximately 20-40%. A further 15-20% of patients will die by 12 months, largely because of comorbidities rather than residual eff ects of acute respiratory distress syndrome. 39 The LUNGSAFE study 40 showed that the syndrome remains common and has a mortality of approximately 40%, and emphasised the global burden. Although, in general, ICU survivors have no reduction in health-related quality of life, full recovery is often limited in those who had acute respiratory distress syndrome. Many have muscle wasting, limiting weakness, and neuropsychiatric illness, including cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. [41] [42] [43] 6 years after ICU discharge, just over 50% have returned to work. 44 Despite these extrapulmonary defi cits, respiratory function returns close to normal. 42 \r\n The development of acute respiratory distress syndrome has been described in the setting of numerous illnesses and injuries, which are broadly classed as being pulmonary or systemic in origin. Pneumonia is the most common risk factor for the development of the syndrome, and, along with aspiration, has the highest associated mortality; trauma-related illness has the lowest. 29 Inappropriately administered mechanical ventilation is an important contributor to both the development and worsening of acute respiratory distress syndrome. 28, 45 This ventilator-induced lung injury can occur by several mechanisms, including excessive lung stretch (volutrauma) 46 or pressure (barotrauma), repetitive alveolar opening and closing, which causes a shearing injury (atelectrauma), and potential oxygen toxicity. 47 These processes also drive excessive systemic infl ammation, with the ability to induce non-pulmonary organ failure (biotrauma). In a randomised controlled trial 45 of 150 critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, ventilation with 10 mL rather than 6 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight was associated with a fi ve-times increase in the odds of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. This fi nding has been substantiated in a further randomised controlled trial 48 in 400 patients at risk of pulmonary complications undergoing general anaesthesia for major abdominal surgery. A non-lungprotective ventilatory strategy of 10-12 mL\/kg tidal volume ventilation with no PEEP was compared with lungprotective ventilation of 6-8 mL\/kg tidal volume with PEEP of 6-8 cm H 2 O plus a recruitment manoeuvre every 30 min. The lung-protective group had fewer major complications (10\u00b75% vs 27\u00b75%; relative risk [RR] 0\u00b740, 95% CI 0\u00b724 to 0\u00b768; p=0\u00b7001), required less respiratory support by day 7 (5% vs 17%; 0\u00b729, 0\u00b714 to 0\u00b761; p=0\u00b7001), and had a shorter hospital stay (11 vs 13 days; diff erence -2\u00b745 days, -4\u00b717 to -0\u00b772; p=0\u00b7006).\r\n The search for potential genes conferring susceptibility to the development of, or that alter the outcome from, acute respiratory distress syndrome is methodologically complex. Genotype, phenotype, race, environment, injury, and therapy interact in variable and uncertain ways to contribute to clinical outcomes. More than 40 candidate genes associated with the development or outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome have been identifi ed, although these investigations have either largely not been suffi ciently robust to provide clear answers, or have yet to be replicated. 49 Data in parentheses in the Murray column are scores; the total number of points scored is divided by the number of categories included, giving the Murray lung injury score. A score of 0 signifi es no lung injury is present, a score of 0\u00b71-2\u00b75 signifi es mild to moderate lung injury, and a score greater than 2\u00b75 signifi es severe lung injury. AECC=American European Consensus Conference. PaO 2 =partial pressure of arterial oxygen. FiO 2 =fraction of inspired oxygen. PEEP=positive end-expiratory pressure. 50 The search for a genetic susceptibility to either the onset, or worsening, of the syndrome might prove diffi cult until issues with the specifi city of the defi nition of acute respiratory distress syndrome and improved phenotyping of patients are addressed. However, a gene with a clearer association with acute respiratory distress syndrome is ACE. This association came to prominence during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, when the ACE2 protein, which contributes to the regulation of pulmonary vascular permeability, was identifi ed as the receptor for the novel coronavirus that caused SARS. 51\r\n After the onset of the primary illness, the infl ammatory alveolar injury occurring has been described in terms of three sequential phases (fi gure 1), which overlap substantially. 26 The process begins with the exudative phase and immune-cell-mediated destruction of the barriers of the alveolar epithelial-inter stitial-endothelial complex, allowing plasma, plasma proteins, and cellular content to successively fl ood the interstitium and airspace. Classically, acute respiratory distress syndrome is recognised to be a neutrophil-driven disease; however, experimental data have shown that alveolar neutrophilia can occur without increased alveolar permeability. 52 Additionally, the involvement of cells from the innate (including macrophages 53 and platelets 54 ) and adaptive immune systems in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome is increasingly recognised. 55 Further neutrophils and macrophages are recruited to this infl ammatory focus, propagating the initial insult. The infl ammatory exudate produced physically interacts with surfactant, initially causing dysfunction followed by, as the epithelial injury progresses, loss of surfactant production, which impedes alveolar patency. The loss of epithelial ion channels impairs the generation of osmotic forces required to return oedema fl uid to the interstitium. These injuries, plus the development of hyaline membranes and decreased pulmonary compliance, result in disrupted gaseous diff usion. Alveolar vascular damage also occurs, with increased permeability coexisting with altered vasomotor tone (both vaso con striction and vasodilation) and microthrombi. Pulmonary hypertension results, increasing right ventricular afterload. This right ventricular dysfunction can be further exacerbated by mechanical ventilation and fl uid overload. This combination of epithelial and endothelial damage results in worsening ventilationperfusion mismatch and loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasocon striction, which leads to refractory hypoxia. Acute lung injury term \u2022 AECC: inconsistency with the use of the term acute lung injury, which has been used to refer to either patients with mild hypoxaemia only (PaO 2 >200 mm Hg) or as an umbrella term for all those meeting the defi nition of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 5 including moderate and severe hypoxaemia\r\n \u2022 Both: many clinicians fail to recognise acute respiratory distress syndrome 6\r\n AECC=American European Consensus Conference. PEEP=positive end-expiratory pressure. PaO 2 =partial pressure of arterial oxygen. FiO 2 =fraction of inspired oxygen.\r\n The proliferative phase marks attempts at recovery, with restoration of the type II alveolar cell population, and subsequent diff erentiation into type I alveolar cells. Regeneration of a functioning epithelial layer permits the clearance of exudative fl uid into the interstitium, and remaining debris is cleared by infl ammatory cells. Vasomotor tone begins to return to normal, microthrombi are cleared, and pulmonary hypertension lessens. As reparation continues, shunt reduces, leading to improved oxygenation that is followed, often more slowly, by recovering pulmonary compliance. The third fi brotic phase develops inconsistently, and comprises failure of removal of alveolar collagen, which is laid down early in the injury process, combined with the development of cystic changes, limiting functional recovery. Diff use alveolar damage is thought to be the pathognomonic pathological fi nding of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 5 is defi ned by the presence of hyaline membranes, and can be detected either by lung biopsy or at autopsy. However, it is not specifi c and can also occur in the absence of the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome. 14 Many patents who fulfi l the diagnostic criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome do not have diff use alveolar damage. 13 Clinical patterns have been recognised in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome-eg, those with a pulmonary cause have more consolidation and less alveolar collapse and interstitial oedema than do those with non-pulmonary causes. 56 Sub phenotypes have been described, and are classifi ed by clinical and biological characteristics with diff ering clinical outcomes and response to treatment. 57, 58 A hyperinfl ammatory phenotype is associated with worse metabolic acidosis, higher vasopressor requirements, increased mortality, and a better response to higher PEEP. Subphenotypes will provide further mechanistic insight to the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is likely to inform the development of personalised therapies.\r\n The Berlin defi nition for acute respiratory distress syndrome is an evolution of the American European Consensus Conference defi nition (table), which was recognised to have numerous fl aws. The revised defi nition, although improved, still has limitations. Several investigational modalities are potentially helpful in monitoring the clinical course (fi gure 2). Sequential imaging via both chest radiography and CT (fi gure 3) provides qualitative measures of disease evolution, and CT also provides specifi c quantitative measures of oedema, aeration, and recruitability. Extravascular lung water, which refl ects the degree of pulmonary oedema, can be measured with a PiCCO [Pulse Contour Cardiac Output] monitor (Pulsion Medical Systems, Feldkirchen, Germany) and is associated with mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. 60, 61 Similarly, lung ultra sonography (fi gure 3) can be used to estimate extravascular lung water, 62, 63 and to allow diff erentiation of the syndrome from cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. 64 Pulmonary wedge 65 responsive ness and are unlikely to off er benefi t in routine management (neither off ers any benefi t over the other). 67 The PaO 2 \/FiO 2 ratio is a measure of oxygenation that is used to classify acute respiratory distress syndrome as mild, moderate, or severe (table) . Although easy to calculate, it is an imperfect measure, because of its variability with diff ering PEEP 16 and tidal volumes. 68 The oxygenation index-the product of mean airway pressure and FiO 2 , divided by PaO 2 -is an alternative to PaO 2 \/FiO 2 and might be superior, because it includes mean airway pressure, which refl ects PEEP. 69 Respiratory system compliance helps with the monitoring of pulmonary mechanics, although it was not included in the Berlin defi nition because it lacked additional discriminatory value. 5 Pulmonary dead space fraction is associated with mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (odds ratio 1\u00b745, 95 % CI 1\u00b715-1\u00b783; p=0\u00b7002), but is technically challenging to measure and not frequently used. 70 Bronchoalveolar lavage permits sampling of the alveolar space and helps with the identifi cation of infectious causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome and with diagnosis of malignancy or haemorrhage.\r\n The absence of a biomarker to defi ne the diagnosis, responsiveness to therapy, and prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome is problematic and limits progress in the fi eld. 71, 72 Diff ering pathologies damage lung tissue in diverse ways, producing inconsistent signals from numerous injured cell types. These signals are further confounded by age, comorbidities, and iatrogenic eff ects such as excessive fl uid administration and harmful ventilation. Many candidate biomarkers (fi gure 2) have been investigated, but a single, clear biomarker has proved diffi cult to fi nd. Biomarkers have been measured in both blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid, but are too inaccurate for clinical use. Combinations of biomarkers could be used to identify specifi c phenotypes of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who might respond diff erentially to therapies, but further work is required to confi rm these initial fi ndings. 57 Open lung biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of diff use alveolar damage. Small, singlecentre observational studies of open lung biopsy in highly selected populations show low specifi city of the clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome for the presence of diff use alveolar damage. 10-12,14 Most patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome undergoing this procedure have resulting alterations in management, 10-12,73,74 improved outcomes, 73 and little noteworthy morbidity. [10] [11] [12] 14, 73, 74 These studies are limited by their selective nature and their constrained ability to examine the entire lung. Open lung biopsy is usually reserved for exceptional cases in which there is a genuine diagnostic dilemma and poor response to therapy. \r\n Management of acute respiratory distress syndrome can be classed as specifi c or supportive; addressing the underlying causative condition is also necessary (fi gure 4). Specifi c measures include both maintenance of gas exchange and manipulation of the underlying pathophysiology. Supportive therapies include sedation, mobilisation, nutrition, and prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism.\r\n Four randomised controlled trials [75] [76] [77] [78] published between 1998 and 1999 provided mixed results for the optimal tidal volume in acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the landmark ARMA study, 28 which was published in 2000 by the ARDSnet group, a traditional ventilatory strategy of 12 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight tidal volume in com bination with a plateau airway pressure \u2264 50 cm H 2 O was compared with a lower tidal volume of 6 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight in com bination with a plateau airway pressure of 30 cm H 2 O or less in 861 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The study was stopped early, because, despite initially worse oxygenation, low-tidal-volume ventilation was associated with an 8\u00b78% (95% CI 2\u00b74-15\u00b73) absolute reduction in mortality (39\u00b78% vs 31\u00b70%; p=0\u00b7007), and signifi cantly more ventilator-free days (10 [SD 11] vs 12 [11]; p=0\u00b7007). Importantly, less injurious ventilation was associated with more days free of non-pulmonary organ failure (12 [11] vs 15 [11]; p=0\u00b7006). Tidal volume was estimated from predicted bodyweight, which is dependent on height and sex, and calculated as 50 + 0\u00b791 \u00d7 (height in cm -152\u00b74) for men and 45\u00b75 + 0\u00b791 \u00d7 (height in cm -152\u00b74) for women. Lung-protective ventilation is associated with improved outcomes if used early in the course of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 79 and reduced mortality at 2 years. 80 Despite the adoption of a volume-limited and pressurelimited protective ventilatory strategy, critically ill mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome receiving a tidal volume of 6 mL\/kg and a plateau pressure of 30 cm H 2 O or less can still be exposed to tidal hyperinfl ation, whereby the smaller-than-usual aerated section of the lung (so-called baby lung) 81 receives a larger-than-usual volume of gas, resulting in greater biotrauma and fewer ventilator-free days than those in patients without tidal hyperinfl ation. 82 Similarly, a post-hoc review 83 of the ARDSnet database did not demonstrate a safe upper limit for plateau pressures in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Volume-limited and pressure-limited ventilation can cause hypercapnic acidosis, and the overall clinical eff ect of protective ventilation and hypercapnia is uncertain. 84 Hypercapnic acidosis could provide protective eff ects in the setting of high-tidal-volume ventilation, but a benefi cial eff ect is not noted in patients receiving lung-protective ventilation. 85 PEEP prevents lung unit collapse at the end of the respiratory cycle. Benefi cial eff ects include the maintenance of functional residual capacity, improved compliance, and higher mean airway pressure, which result in decreased shunt with enhanced oxygenation, and reduced atelectasis and biotrauma. These advantages should be weighed against the eff ects of raised intrathoracic pressure-namely, decreased venous return and increased right ventricular afterload. 86 Numerous methods of setting the PEEP level have been described, including most recently oesophageal balloon manometry. 87 In the lung-protective era, four randomised controlled trials [87] [88] [89] [90] have been done to answer the question of whether higher or lower pressure is superior, with a suggestion that higher PEEP could be benefi cial. A metaanalysis 91 of three of these trials also showed a possible benefi t for a high PEEP setting in acute respiratory distress syndrome, which was associated with both lower in-hospital mortality (34\u00b71% vs 39\u00b71%; RR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b781-1\u00b700; p=0\u00b7049) and less require ment for mechanical ventilation by day 28 (hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b716, 95% CI 1\u00b703-1\u00b730; p=0\u00b701). 91 The EPVent randomised controlled trial, 87 in which oesophageal-balloon manometry-guided PEEP was compared with use of the ARDSnet PEEP-FiO 2 table, showed that oesophageal-guided PEEP provided increased oxy genation and compliance, which translated into higher PEEP (18 cm vs 12 cm H 2 O on day one) and associated improved adjusted 28 day mortality (RR 0\u00b746, 95% CI 0\u00b719-1\u00b70; p=0\u00b7049). 87 A further meta-analysis that included this additional study showed non-signifi cant improvements in 28 day mortality with higher PEEP (pooled RR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b779-1\u00b702), without a signifi cantly higher risk of barotrauma (1\u00b717, 0\u00b790-1\u00b752). 92 The driving pressure, which is defi ned as the diff erence between plateau and end-expiratory pressures, has been suggested as the mediator for the benefi cial eff ects of the three main components of lung-protective ventilationnamely, low tidal volume, low plateau pressure, and high PEEP. 93 On the basis of derivation and validation cohorts from 3562 patients recruited into nine randomised controlled trials, Amato and colleagues 93 reported that an increase in driving pressure of 7 cm H 2 O was associated with increased 60 day mortality (RR 1\u00b741, 95% CI 1\u00b731-1\u00b751; p<0\u00b7001). According to the statistical method of multilevel mediation analysis, none of the three main components of lung-protective ventilation was individually associated with reduced mortality, but they acted via a reduced driving pressure to exert their benefi cial eff ects.\r\n Driving pressure could help to calibrate the mechanical stress delivered by the ventilator to the functional aerated lung volume. Although 6 mL\/kg tidal volume is recognised as low-tidal-volume ventilation, it is the normal tidal volume of most mammalian species. 94 As the available functional lung volume falls in acute respiratory distress syndrome as a result of collapse and consolidation, perhaps the delivered tidal volume should also decrease. Although evidence suggests that targeting of driving pressure is prudent, whether driving pressure relates causally to outcome remains to be established in a prospective, randomised controlled trial. This concept is being investigated in the setting of studies of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal to facilitate very-low-tidal-volume or ultra-protective ventilation. 95 Although these data for driving pressure are post hoc, observational in nature, and necessitate confi rmation in a prospective study, an upper limit for driving pressure of 15 cm H 2 O could be appropriate in the interim.\r\n Atelectatic areas of lung can be re-expanded by the application of brief periods of sustained high transpulmonary pressure-usually followed by the application of higher levels of PEEP to maintain and stabilise this newly reaerated region. Three commonly used such recruitment manoeuvres are sighs, sustained infl ations, and extended sighs. 96 Brief periods of raised intrathoracic pressure also impede venous return to the right atrium, predisposing to hypotension. Preclinical data have shown divergent eff ects of recruitment manoeuvres on alveolar epithelial and endothelial function. 97 A systematic review, 98 based on 40 studies, showed that recruitment manoeuvres increased oxygenation, but little information about the long-term eff ects of these interventions and no clear guidance on the usefulness of this procedure was available.\r\n There are few robust randomised controlled trials to guide the choice of mode of mechanical ventilation. The authors of a 2015 Cochrane review, summarising three randomised controlled trials consisting of 1089 patients in total, concluded that evidence was insuffi cient to promote the use of either volume-controlled or pressurecontrolled ventilation over the other. 99 Airway-pressurerelease ventilation is used for its ability to maintain a high mean airway pressure-and thus maintain alveolar recruitment-while permitting spontaneous ventilation. Unfortunately, the evidence base is limited by suboptimum control groups in the studies done and concerns about possible high tidal volume and mean airway pressure. 100 Non-invasive ventilation can be tried in mild acute respiratory distress syndrome. A small study 101 of 40 patients showed reduced requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation and a non-signifi cant reduction in mortality with this approach. This result should be tempered by those of a much larger meta-analysis of 540 patients, documenting failure of non-invasive ventilation in almost 50% of patients. 102 The advent of high-fl ow nasal oxygen allows for simpler, more tolerable respiratory support. In an observational study, 18 (40%) of 45 patients with moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (mean PaO 2 \/FiO 2 137 mm Hg) treated with high-fl ow nasal oxygen required invasive mechanical ventilation. 103 As with non-invasive ventilation, more severe illness was associated with an increasing likelihood of treatment failure.\r\n Placing a patient prone while they receive invasive mechanical ventilation provides many physiological advantages for the management of refractory hypoxaemia, including redistribution of consolidation from dorsal to ventral areas of the lung, removal of the weight of the heart and mediastinum from the lung, improved alveolar ventilation, shunt reduction with increased oxygenation, and reduced pulmonary infl am matory cytokine production. 104 Several studies [105] [106] [107] [108] produced confl icting results about the effi cacy of prone positioning ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although prolonged prone positioning's association with physiological improvement was in creasingly recognised, 109 in these studies prone ventilation was of short duration. Additionally, sub sequent meta-analyses 110, 111 suggested benefi t specifi cally in the most hypoxaemic patients receiving lung-protective ven tilation. The PROSEVA study 112 was designed to address these shortcomings. 466 patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (which was defi ned as a PaO 2 of less than 150 mm Hg while being ventilated with an FiO 2 of 0\u00b76 or greater) who were receiving lung-protective ventilation were randomly assigned to either the supine position or daily prone position sessions lasting at least 16 h. Prone position ventilation was associated with reduced 28 day mortality compared with supine ventilation (32\u00b78% vs 16\u00b70%, p<0\u00b7001; HR 0\u00b744, 95% CI 0\u00b729-0\u00b767). There were no additional complications associated with prone positioning, although the centres involved were all experienced with this technique. This magnitude of eff ect, although large, was predicted by a previous meta-analysis. 111\r\n The hypoxaemia of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome might necessitate excessive ventilatory support, risking the development of ventilator-induced lung injury. Paralysis removes endogenous eff ort, improving respiratory mechanics and lowering oxygen con sumption. In the ACCURSY study, 113 cisatracurium-besylate-induced paralysis was compared with placebo in 340 patients with early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Neuromuscular blockade for 48 h resulted in-after adjustment for baseline PaO 2 \/FiO 2 , plateau pressure, and Simplifi ed Acute Physiology II scores-a reduced adjusted HR for death at 90 days (0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b748-0\u00b798; p=0\u00b704). Importantly, the frequency of complications, including ICU-acquired weakness, did not diff er between groups. Although promising, additional large clinical trials are required to confi rm these fi ndings.\r\n Because mechanical ventilation is reliant on a functional alveolus for gaseous diff usion, it is unable to provide lifesaving respiratory support when a critical volume of alveolar units has failed. In addition to replacing endogenous alveolar gaseous exchange, extracorporeal gas exchange-either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal-allows reduction in ventilatory settings, reducing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. At present, the evidence base for these interventions is sparse, consisting of case series, observational cohort studies, and one randomised controlled trial. In the CESAR study, 114 rather than directly assessing ECMO in refractory hypoxaemia, investigators compared management at a referring centre with management at a tertiary centre capable of providing ECMO in 180 patients. The cohort managed at the ECMO centre had a higher rate of survival without disability at 6 months than did those managed at referring centres (63% vs 47%; RR 0\u00b769, 95% CI 0\u00b705-0\u00b797; p=0\u00b703), although only 75% of the group received ECMO. Two observational studies, one from Australia and New Zealand 115 and one from the UK, 116 also showed high rates of survival with ECMO in patients with infl uenza A (H1N1) with refractory hypoxaemia on maximum ventilatory support. However, ECMO is a scarce and expensive resource that is often available only at specialist centres (fi gure 4) and associated with well recognised complications, including bleeding, vascular damage, and risks from interhospital transfer. Despite widespread and growing use worldwide, at present there is an absence of level one evidence for its effi cacy. In the UK, ECMO is a nationally commissioned service provided at few regional centres.\r\n High-frequency oscillatory ventilation is the provision of small tidal volumes (typically 2 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight) at high frequencies of up to 900 breaths per min, via several atypical mechanisms of gas transfer. This mode of ventilation also aff ords separation of oxygenation, which is dependent on FiO 2 and mean airway pressure, from carbon dioxide removal, which is an active process that depends on the pressure amplitude and frequency of oscillation. Two large randomised controlled trials, from Canada (OSCILLATE) 35 and the UK (OSCAR), 36 failed to show benefi t from this mode of ventilation. OSCILLATE showed harm associated with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, possibly due to the high mean airway pressure generated causing haemo dynamic compromise and requiring higher doses and duration of vasopressor, in addition to more sedation and paralysis.\r\n In the past 5 years, statins and \u03b2 2 agonists have been investigated in large placebo-controlled, phase 3 randomised studies. In addition to their cholesterollowering eff ects, statins have pleotropic properties, making them an attractive potential therapy. In the Irish Critical Care Trials Group's HARP-2 study, 37 Preclinical data suggest that \u03b2 2 agonists could modify several pulmonary mechanisms. They increase alveolarfl uid clearance, are cytoprotective, and have antiinfl ammatory properties, which prompted investigation of salbutamol as a potential therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome. [117] [118] [119] In the UK BALTI-2 study, 120 intravenous salbutamol was given at a dose of 15 \u03bcg per kg of ideal bodyweight per h; the trial was terminated for safety reasons after recruiting 326 patients of a planned 1334. Salbutamol was associated with increased 28 day mortality compared with placebo (34% vs 23%, RR 1\u202247, 95% CI 1\u202203-2\u202208), and decreased ventilator-free and organ-failure-free days; its eff ects were possibly mediated through cardiac and metabolic toxicity, in the form of arrhythmias and lactic acidosis. The US ARDSnet ALTA study 121 of inhaled salbutamol (5 mg every 4 h for up to 10 days in 282 patients) was stopped for futility. There was no signifi cant diff erence between the active and placebo groups in the primary outcome of ventilator-free days (14\u00b74 vs 16\u00b76, 95% CI for diff erence -4\u00b77 to 0\u00b73; p=0\u00b7087) or the secondary outcome of in-hospital mortality (23\u00b70% vs 17\u00b77%, -4\u00b70 to 14\u00b77; p=0\u00b730), although patients with shock at baseline in the salbutamol group had fewer ICU-free days than did those in the placebo group.\r\n Two other pharmacotherapies deserve mentioncorticosteroids and nitric oxide. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is an infl ammatory lung injury, and the use of corticosteroids would thus appear ideally suited to it, with their ability to dampen both infl ammation and fi brosis. Unfortunately, despite a plethora of trials, there is inadequate evidence to make a defi nitive recom mendation in favour of or against the use of corticosteroids, 122, 123 although the US ARDSnet steroid study suggested harm if corticosteroid therapy was started more than 14 days after the onset of the syndrome. 124 Nitric oxide is an inhaled pulmonary vaso dilator that improves ventilationperfusion matching, resulting in increased oxygenation. However, this increase in oxygenation does not translate into improved patient-centred outcomes. 125 Nitric oxide is associated with numerous complications, including renal failure and rebound pulmonary hypertension. 125 Various other anti-infl ammatory and pathophysiologically (fi gure 5) targeted drugs have been investigated, but have not demonstrated robust eff ectiveness. 126, 127 Fluid management Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a form of pulmonary oedema, and thus fl uid therapy is an essential aspect of management. Fluid excess is increasingly linked to detrimental outcomes across the spectrum of critical illnesses. 128 A general paradigm exists of early fl uid loading for resuscitation and organ rescue during Thrombosis Key the presentation stage of the illness, followed by fl uid unloading (deresuscitation)-either spontaneous or induced-after haemodynamic stability has been achieved. 129 Fluid-induced lung injury describes the development of lung injury after intravenous fl uid administration. The rapid administration of saline in healthy volunteers can cause pulmonary interstitial oedema; 130 patients with sepsis can experience decreased oxygenation and worsening lung injury scores as a result of fl uid bolus administration after initial resuscitation. 131 In a randomised controlled trial 132 in 1001 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome managed with lungprotective ventilation (FACTT), a detailed algorithm targeting cardiac fi lling pressures in the setting of haemodynamic stability was used for a comparison of liberal and conservative fl uid strategies. At 1 week, a conservative strategy was associated with a net neutral fl uid balance compared with a 7 L positive balance in the control arm, resulting in signifi cantly increased oxygenation, a better lung injury score, more ventilatorfree and ICU-free days, and fewer blood transfusions in the conservatively managed group. There was no diff erence between the conservative and liberal strategies in the primary outcome of death at 60 days (25\u00b75% [SD 1\u00b79] vs 28\u00b74% [2\u00b70]; 95% CI for diff erence -2\u00b76 to 8\u00b74, p=0\u00b730) or incidence of organ failures. A follow-up study at 2 years, however, showed an increased incidence of cognitive impairment in the deresuscitated group (adjusted odds ratio 3\u00b735 [95% CI 1\u00b716-9\u00b770] to 5\u00b746 [1\u00b792-15\u00b753]). 133 A small randomised controlled trial 134 of combined therapy with albumin and furosemide administration in 37 hypoproteinaemic patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome demonstrated improvements in oxygenation, fl uid balance, and haemodynamics. A further small follow-up study by the same group, in which furosemide administration with or without albumin supplementation was compared, suggested that the combination was superior to furosemide administration alone. However, in the large randomised controlled ALBIOS trial, 135 in which investigators examined a strategy of albumin administration to maintain plasma albumin concentrations higher than 30 g\/L in patients with sepsis and septic shock, benefi cial eff ects on respiratory sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were not associated with higher plasma albumin concentrations, although a specifi ed subgroup analysis was not done for this outcome. Therefore whether albumin has a place in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome remains unclear. On the basis of available evidence, synthetic colloids do not have any role in the management of the critically ill. 136 \r\n Investigators in the EDEN study explored the eff ect of low-volume trophic feeding for up to 6 days in 1000 non-malnourished patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome. 137 Despite separation of calorifi c delivery between groups (roughly 400 kcal per day vs full feeding of 1300 kcal per day), neither the primary outcome of ventilator-free days (14\u00b79 vs 15\u00b70; diff erence \u22120\u00b71, 95% CI \u22121\u00b74 to 1\u00b72; p=0\u00b789) nor the seco ndary outcomes of 60 day mortality (23\u00b72% vs 22\u00b72%; 1\u00b70, \u22124\u00b71 to 6\u00b73; p=0\u00b777) or infectious complications diff ered between groups. The full feed group, however, received more prokinetic agents, and spent more days with increased gastric residual volume, vomiting, and constipation. Additionally, there was no diff erence in physical or cognitive function in survivors at 1 year. 138 The ability to modulate the infl ammatory response via immunonutrition-ie, the delivery of immune-enhancing dietary agents such as fi sh oils, glutamine, selenium, vitamins, and other antioxidants-has long been a potential target. Early studies were suggestive of benefi t, especially when used in acute respiratory distress syndrome. 139 But randomised controlled trials have not shown effi cacy for a range of additives in either patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome 140 or those needing general critical care. [141] [142] [143] In the OMEGA study, 144 the twice daily use of the n-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, \u03b3-linolenic acid, and a mixture of antioxidants, was compared with use of an isocaloric control in 272 patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome who were also receiving enteral nutrition. Despite an eight-times increase in plasma n-3 fatty acid concentrations in the intervention group, there were clear signals of harm necessitating the termination of the study, including decreased ventilatorfree, non-pulmonary-organ-failure-free, and ICU-free days, and a non-signifi cant increase in mortality. A subsequent small phase 2 study of fi sh oils in 90 patients again failed to demonstrate benefi t in this population. 140 A meta-analysis 145 supported a lack of effi cacy associated with fi sh oil supplementation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, and a consensus paper summarising current nutritional evidence did not support the administration of pharma conutrients. 146\r\n There are no direct comparative studies of the optimum choice of sedative or depth of sedation to be obtained in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, patients should be lightly sedated, with emphasis on analgesia, and benzodiazepines should be avoided when possible. 147 Early deep sedation in mechanically ventilated patients is associated with increased mortality; 148 by contrast, early mobilisation has been associated with improved outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure. 149\r\n Despite promising preclinical and early clinical data, most large phase 2 and 3 studies of therapeutic interventions in acute respiratory distress syndrome have failed to demonstrate effi cacy. There are many reasons for this failure, but arguably the most important is the limitation of the current defi nitions of acute respiratory distress syndrome in terms of the identifi cation of patients expressing the biological target under investigation. In approximately half of patients who meet diagnostic criteria and subsequently undergo post-mortem examination, the pathognomonic fi nding of diff use alveolar damage is not present. 6-9,13 These patients could have a mixture of coexisting conditions. In most positive trials so far, the improved outcome was a result of less injurious mechanical ventilation in the intervention group. All mechanically ventilated patients are at risk of ventilator-induced lung injury, and thus the limitation of recruiting a heterogeneous cohort based on the defi nition of acute respiratory distress syndrome is minimised. However, when a therapy aimed at a specifi c biological target is investigated, such heterogeneity assumes greater importance and reduces the ability to detect any possible eff ect.\r\n This issue raises the question as to whether the unsuccessful therapeutic trials reported would have had the same results had it been possible to identify specifi c phenotypes responsive to the therapy under investigation. Constructing a trial in which 50% of the study population does not have the biological target under investigation is problematic and has clear implications for the evidence base for acute respiratory distress syndrome, which has been largely reliant on the American European Consensus Conference and Berlin defi nitions. In the era of personalised therapy, discovery of a biomarker or panel of biomarkers that can not only identify a specifi c population, but also, more importantly, defi ne the responsiveness to therapy is essential. 71, 72 Guidelines for the ventilatory management of acute respiratory distress syndrome have been issued by the Scandinavian Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine 150 and the Brazilian Association of Intensive Care Medicine and the Brazilian Thoracic Society. 151, 152 Guidelines from the American Thoracic Society on mechanical ventilation in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome and from the UK Intensive Care Society on management are in development.","sha":"056610b4981cee0efc485ed3f978f541fbe55f54","publish_time":"2016-11-18","authors":"Sweeney, Rob Mac; McAuley, Daniel F","journal":"The Lancet","doi":"10.1016\/s0140-6736(16)00578-x","Title":"The Lancet","H index":700.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, due to alveolar injury secondary to an infl ammatory process, that can be either pulmonary or systemic in origin. As a syndrome, it is characterised by the presence of several criteria. The landmark ARMA study, 28 which was published in 2000, demonstrated the benefi ts of a low-tidal-volume, low-airway-pressure ventilatory strategy in acute respiratory distress syndrome and marked the establishment of lung protective ventilation as the standard of care. Many have muscle wasting, limiting weakness, and neuropsychiatric illness, including cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. [ 44 Despite these extrapulmonary defi cits, respiratory function returns close to normal. Pneumonia is the most common risk factor for the development of the syndrome, and, along with aspiration, has the highest associated mortality; trauma-related illness has the lowest. 29 Inappropriately administered mechanical ventilation is an important contributor to both the development and worsening of acute respiratory distress syndrome. 47 These processes also drive excessive systemic infl ammation, with the ability to induce non-pulmonary organ failure (biotrauma). More than 40 candidate genes associated with the development or outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome have been identifi ed, although these investigations have either largely not been suffi ciently robust to provide clear answers, or have yet to be replicated. A score of 0 signifi es no lung injury is present, a score of 0\u00b71-2\u00b75 signifi es mild to moderate lung injury, and a score greater than 2\u00b75 signifi es severe lung injury. AECC=American European Consensus Conference. PaO 2 =partial pressure of arterial oxygen. However, a gene with a clearer association with acute respiratory distress syndrome is ACE. Classically, acute respiratory distress syndrome is recognised to be a neutrophil-driven disease; however, experimental data have shown that alveolar neutrophilia can occur without increased alveolar permeability. The infl ammatory exudate produced physically interacts with surfactant, initially causing dysfunction followed by, as the epithelial injury progresses, loss of surfactant production, which impedes alveolar patency. The loss of epithelial ion channels impairs the generation of osmotic forces required to return oedema fl uid to the interstitium. Pulmonary hypertension results, increasing right ventricular afterload. Acute lung injury term \u2022 AECC: inconsistency with the use of the term acute lung injury, which has been used to refer to either patients with mild hypoxaemia only (PaO 2 >200 mm Hg) or as an umbrella term for all those meeting the defi nition of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 5 including moderate and severe hypoxaemia\r\n \u2022 Both: many clinicians fail to recognise acute respiratory distress syndrome 6\r\n AECC=American European Consensus Conference. Vasomotor tone begins to return to normal, microthrombi are cleared, and pulmonary hypertension lessens. 57, 58 A hyperinfl ammatory phenotype is associated with worse metabolic acidosis, higher vasopressor requirements, increased mortality, and a better response to higher PEEP. Subphenotypes will provide further mechanistic insight to the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is likely to inform the development of personalised therapies. The Berlin defi nition for acute respiratory distress syndrome is an evolution of the American European Consensus Conference defi nition (table), which was recognised to have numerous fl aws. The revised defi nition, although improved, still has limitations. Sequential imaging via both chest radiography and CT (fi gure 3) provides qualitative measures of disease evolution, and CT also provides specifi c quantitative measures of oedema, aeration, and recruitability. 64 Pulmonary wedge 65 responsive ness and are unlikely to off er benefi t in routine management (neither off ers any benefi t over the other). Although easy to calculate, it is an imperfect measure, because of its variability with diff ering PEEP 16 and tidal volumes. 70 Bronchoalveolar lavage permits sampling of the alveolar space and helps with the identifi cation of infectious causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome and with diagnosis of malignancy or haemorrhage. The absence of a biomarker to defi ne the diagnosis, responsiveness to therapy, and prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome is problematic and limits progress in the fi eld. 71, 72 Diff ering pathologies damage lung tissue in diverse ways, producing inconsistent signals from numerous injured cell types. 57 Open lung biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of diff use alveolar damage. 10] [11] [12] 14, 73, 74 These studies are limited by their selective nature and their constrained ability to examine the entire lung. Supportive therapies include sedation, mobilisation, nutrition, and prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism. In the landmark ARMA study, 28 which was published in 2000 by the ARDSnet group, a traditional ventilatory strategy of 12 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight tidal volume in com bination with a plateau airway pressure \u2264 50 cm H 2 O was compared with a lower tidal volume of 6 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight in com bination with a plateau airway pressure of 30 cm H 2 O or less in 861 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. 84 Hypercapnic acidosis could provide protective eff ects in the setting of high-tidal-volume ventilation, but a benefi cial eff ect is not noted in patients receiving lung-protective ventilation. 87 In the lung-protective era, four randomised controlled trials [87] [88] [89] [90] have been done to answer the question of whether higher or lower pressure is superior, with a suggestion that higher PEEP could be benefi cial. 93 On the basis of derivation and validation cohorts from 3562 patients recruited into nine randomised controlled trials, Amato and colleagues 93 reported that an increase in driving pressure of 7 cm H 2 O was associated with increased 60 day mortality (RR 1\u00b741, 95% CI 1\u00b731-1\u00b751; p<0\u00b7001). Preclinical data have shown divergent eff ects of recruitment manoeuvres on alveolar epithelial and endothelial function. There are few robust randomised controlled trials to guide the choice of mode of mechanical ventilation. Placing a patient prone while they receive invasive mechanical ventilation provides many physiological advantages for the management of refractory hypoxaemia, including redistribution of consolidation from dorsal to ventral areas of the lung, removal of the weight of the heart and mediastinum from the lung, improved alveolar ventilation, shunt reduction with increased oxygenation, and reduced pulmonary infl am matory cytokine production. The PROSEVA study 112 was designed to address these shortcomings. However, ECMO is a scarce and expensive resource that is often available only at specialist centres (fi gure 4) and associated with well recognised complications, including bleeding, vascular damage, and risks from interhospital transfer. Unfortunately, despite a plethora of trials, there is inadequate evidence to make a defi nitive recom mendation in favour of or against the use of corticosteroids, 122, 123 although the US ARDSnet steroid study suggested harm if corticosteroid therapy was started more than 14 days after the onset of the syndrome.

COPD exacerbations are associated with increased airway and systemic infl ammation and physiological changes, especially the development of hyperinfl ation. They are triggered mainly by respiratory viruses and bacteria, which infect the lower airway and increase airway infl ammation. Some patients are particularly susceptible to exacerbations, and show worse health status and faster disease progression than those who have infrequent exacerbations. Several pharmacological interventions are eff ective for the reduction of exacerbation frequency and severity in COPD such as inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators, and their combinations. Non-pharmacological therapies such as pulmonary rehabilitation, self-management, and home ventilatory support are becoming increasingly important, but still need to be studied in controlled trials. The future of exacerbation prevention is in assessment of optimum combinations of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies that will result in improvement of health status, and reduction of hospital admission and mortality associated with COPD.","text_body":"Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) impose a substantial burden on health-care systems worldwide; they are a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and reduced health status. 1 COPD exacerbations are now the most common cause of medical hospital admission in the UK (accounting for 15\u00b79% of hospital admissions), at a cost to the National Health System of over \u00a3253 million a year. 2 Exacerbations are also important outcome measures in COPD, and thus a reduction in their frequency is a key target for intervention.\r\n Although in half of community-treated exacerbations, patients recover to baseline symptoms by 7 days, a study of the time course showed that in 14% of these events patients had still not returned to baseline symptoms within 35 days of onset, and in a small proportion of exacerbations, symptoms never returned to the baseline level. 3 Thus COPD exacerbations can be quite protracted, which accounts for some of the considerable morbidity associated with such an event. An audit of hospital admissions showed that around 30% of patients presenting with an index exacerbation will be seen again and possibly readmitted with another (or recurrent) event within 8 weeks. 4 In a cohort of patients with moderate to severe COPD followed-up after exacerbation, 22% had a recurrent event within 50 days of the fi rst (index) exacerbation. Thus, such events are complex, and an initial exacerbation seems to increase susceptibility to a subsequent one. 5\r\n An exacerbation of COPD is described as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms associated with a variable degree of physiological deterioration. 3 The guidelines of the WHO and US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 6 defi ne an exacerbation as \"an event in the natural course of the disease characterized by a change in the patient's baseline dyspnoea, cough, and\/or sputum that is beyond normal day-to-day variations, is acute in onset, and may warrant a change in regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD\". 6 Defi nitions based on use of health care have also been proposed, eg, unscheduled physician visits, changes or increases in medication, use of antibiotics or oral steroids at exacerbation, and hospital admission. 7 However, health-care use in COPD can vary depending on access, and thus there could be substantial diffi culty in the standardisation of such a defi nition. Additionally, many COPD exacerbations are not reported to health-care professionals and are either self-treated or left untreated. 1 The latest GOLD guidelines also indicate that exacerbations can be self-limiting, especially if of mild severity, and the phrase \"may warrant a change in regular medication\" has been incorporated. 7 However, health-care use can be used to defi ne exacerbation severity: often defi ned as mild if increases in regular inhaled medication are needed, moderate if courses of steroids or antibiotics are needed, and severe if the patient requires hospital admission.\r\n Exacerbations are usually infl ammatory events, with several airway and systemic infl ammatory markers increasing. 5 There has been substantial interest in developing a systemic biomarker as a diagnostic test for Search strategy and selection criteria We searched Medline ( -May, 2007 , Embase ( -May, 2007 , and CINAHL (1956 -April, 2006 with the search terms \"acute exacerbation of COPD\", \"COPD exacerbation prevention\", \"COPD exacerbation impact\". Thus we largely selected publications in the past 10 years but did not exclude commonly referenced and highly regarded older publications. We also searched the reference lists of articles identifi ed by this search strategy and selected those we judged relevant. Decisions to include specifi c references were based on authors' knowledge of published work, participation in expert meetings, and many years of research on the subject. Thus, this work is not an exhaustive systematic review of the burden and prevention of COPD exacerbations. However, it is an overview of current thinking on the importance of COPD exacerbations and how to prevent them based on research evidence and clinical practice. an exacerbation. Hurst and colleagues 8 did a large study of plasma biomarkers for COPD exacerbations, with 36 candidate molecules assessed in paired baseline and exacerbation plasma samples, and tested against a standard defi nition, meeting both health-care use and symptom-based criteria. To confi rm the diagnosis of exacerbation, the most selective biomarker was C-reactive protein (CRP) but this was neither suffi ciently sensitive nor specifi c alone. However, the combination of CRP with any increased major exacerbation symptom on that day (dyspnoea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence) increased the sensitivity and specifi city. Further research will aid in the understanding of mechanisms of COPD exacerbations and will lead to the development of more specifi c biomarkers.\r\n COPD exacerbations are associated with increased upper and lower airway and systemic infl ammation (fi gure 1). 9-13 There is little information available on the nature of the airway infl ammatory changes especially when studied close to an exacerbation, because taking bronchial biopsies at exacerbation in patients with moderate to severe COPD is diffi cult. In stable COPD there is an increase in the CD8+ lymphocytes and macrophages in the bronchial mucosa and an increase in neutrophils with more severe disease. 14 In one study, where biopsies were done at exacerbation in patients with chronic bronchitis, increased airway eosinophilia was reported, although the patients studied had only mild COPD. 10 Modest increases were seen in neutrophils, T lymphocytes (CD3), and TNF alpha positive cells. However, in patients with more severe COPD, increases have been seen in airway neutrophils when stable that increase further at exacerbation. [10] [11] [12] Qiu and colleagues 11 have studied biopsies from patients with severe COPD, who were treated at exacerbation with tracheal intubation, and showed that there was pronounced airway neutrophilia, neutrophil elastase expression, and upregulation of neutrophil chemokine expression. However, studies in intubated patients with COPD are diffi cult, since the results can be complicated by secondary infection. Oxidative stress is a key factor in the development of airway infl ammation in COPD. A study has shown that patients with severe exacerbations who needed hospital admission or assisted ventilation have evidence of increased large airway interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels and increased oxidative stress. 12 Various markers of oxidative stress have been shown to rise in the airways with exacerbation such as hydrogen peroxide and 8-isoprostane and these markers can take some time to recover to baseline. 15 Upper airway infl ammation is increased in COPD patients, increases further at exacerbation, and is associated with lower airway infl ammatory changes. 13, 16 Systemic infl ammation increases at exacerbation and although the causes of this response in COPD are not clear, there is probably a spill-over of infl ammatory markers from the lungs. By contrast with stable disease, 16 exacerbations seem to be associated with a direct correlation between the degree of airway infl ammation and the size of the systemic acute-phase response. 13 Systemic infl am mation increases when the exacerbation is associated with bacterial and viral infection. 17 Several infl ammatory markers increase at exacerbation, such as plasma fi brinogen and CRP, that have been linked to increased cardiovascular risk. Respiratory infections have been associated with increased cardiac events 18 and thus a COPD exacerbation, especially if triggered by an infection, might also be associated with increased cardiac morbidity.\r\n The airway infl ammatory responses during COPD exacerbations cause airway oedema, bronchospasm, and increased sputum production, leading to worsening airfl ow limitation and development of dynamic hyperinfl ation. 19 Such hyperinfl ation is the main cause of dyspnoea, the most common symptom of an exacerbation, and has other eff ects including modulating gas exchange, mechanical, and cardiovascular eff ects. 19 Generally the more severe the underlying disease, the greater the degree of physiological change at exacerbation leading to worsening of airfl ow limitation, and thus the more likely the patient is to develop respiratory failure.\r\n Changes in airfl ow limitation result in changes in peak expiratory fl ow rate, but available data suggest that changes in peak fl ow are too small to be useful in 20 Novel physiological methods to monitor exacerbations are being developed, and some data now suggest that inspiratory capacity measurements 21 or within-breath forced oscillation measurements 22 might be more useful to assess COPD exacerbations and indicate the degree of physiological impairment.\r\n COPD exacerbations are heterogeneous events that are now thought to be caused by complex interactions between the host, respiratory viruses, airway bacteria, and environmental pollution, leading to an increase in the infl ammatory burden (panel). 23\r\n COPD exacerbations are frequently triggered by upper respiratory tract infections, which are more common in the winter months, when respiratory viral infections are prevalent in the community. Lung function also shows small but signifi cant falls with reduction in outdoor temperature. 24 Exacerbations triggered by respiratory viral infections are more severe and are associated with longer recovery times than those triggered by other factors. 25, 26 Molecular diagnostic techniques have now enabled detection of respiratory viruses at exacerbation, which have been isolated in around half of exacerbations, 27, 28 although this fi nding might be an underestimate due to diffi culties in sampling at onset of symptoms. There have been few such studies in the developing world, but a study from Hong Kong detected viruses in only 22% of exacerbations. 29 However, this study diff ered from others in the choice of assay and in that samples were taken from the upper airway rather than directly from the lower airway. A smaller study of 14 COPD patients admitted to hospital in Singapore reported that 64% of COPD exacerbations were associated with viruses although, like the Hong Kong study, most were associated with infl uenza virus, 30 which was possibly due to less frequent use of the infl uenza vaccine.\r\n The most common viruses isolated are human rhinoviruses (the most frequent viruses associated with exacerbations), and other viruses including coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, infl uenza, parainfl uenza, and adenovirus. Since the introduction of infl uenza immunisation for patients with chronic lung disease, the virus has become a less prominent cause of exacerbation, though it is still likely to be an important factor at times of epidemics. Although respiratory syncytial virus infection has been seen at exacerbation, 31 whether it was the sole cause is not entirely clear, since this virus has been detected in the airways of COPD patients when they are stable and is associated with increased airway infl ammation in stable COPD. 32 Latent expression of adenoviral E1A protein in alveolar epithelial cells can amplify the eff ects of lung infl ammation induced by cigarette smoke. 33 Thus, chronic viral infection might be linked to disease severity in COPD and further work is required on the relation between viruses detected in the stable state and at exacerbation.\r\n With PCR techniques, rhinoviruses can be recovered from induced sputum more frequently than from nasal aspirates at exacerbation, 26 suggesting that wild-type rhinoviruses can infect the lower airway and contribute to infl ammatory changes at exacerbation. Low-dose experimental rhinovirus infection in patients with mild COPD has been shown produce symptoms that are typical of an exacerbation, confi rming that respiratory viruses can infect the lower airway. 34 Exacerbations triggered by respiratory viruses are also more severe, associated with longer recovery times, 27 and have more chance of hospital admission than exacerbations where respiratory viruses were not detected. 35\r\n The precise role of bacteria at COPD exacerbations has been diffi cult to assess, since airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state is associated with the same organisms as those isolated at exacerba tions, including Haemophilus Infl uenzae, Streptococcus Pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 36 In one study in patients with moderate to severe COPD, bacteria were seen in 48\u00b72% of patients in the stable state, rising to 69\u00b76% at exacerbation, with an associated rise in airway bacterial load. 37 Purulent sputum prod uction has been regarded as a surrogate marker of bacterial infection, because COPD exacerba tions associated with purulent sputum are more likely to produce positive bacterial cultures than those where the sputum production was mucoid. 38, 39 Evidence for the involvement of bacteria has come from studies of antibiotic therapy, since exacerbations are often associated with increased sputum purulence and volume, and antibiotics have traditionally been used as fi rst line therapy. A study investigating the benefi t of antibiotics in more than 300 acute exacerba tions showed a greater treatment success rate in patients treated with antibiotics, especially if their initial presentation was with the symptoms of increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, and purulence, than in patients who did not receive such treatment. 40 Patients with mild COPD obtained less benefi t from antibiotic therapy than those with more severe COPD. The results of a meta-analysis have shown that antibiotic treatment off ered a small but signifi cant benefi t in treatment failure and mortality. 41 Substantial progress has been made on investigat ing the role of bacterial infection at exacerbation, with the development of molecular typing methods allowing the detection of changes in bacterial strains, rather than species. Sethi and colleagues 42 have suggested that isolation of a new bacterial strain in COPD patients who were regularly sampled was associated with an in creased risk of an exacerbation. However, this fi nding does not conclusively prove that bacteria are direct causes of exacerbations, because not all exacerbations were associated with strain change, and not all strain changes resulted in exacerbation. The strain-specifi c immune responses to colonising bacterial species 43 provide some further evidence that bacteria are not just innocent bystanders in the lower airways during exacerbations.\r\n However, the situation with airway infection is further complicated, since in many COPD exacerbations both respiratory viruses and bacteria could be isolated. A greater systemic infl ammatory response has been reported in those exacerbations associated with both H infl uenzae and rhinovirus isolation, and if the isolation of H infl uenzae was associated with new or worsening coryzal symptoms (a surrogate of viral infection), such infections were more severe as assessed by changes in symptoms and lung function at exacerbation onset. 37 This change has been confi rmed in a further study which reported greater lung function impairment and longer hospitalisations in patients with exacerba tions associated with viral and bacterial coinfection than in those without coinfection. 44 Thus bacterial coinfection with viruses might be of greater importance than bacterial infection alone at COPD exacerbation but consensus within the fi eld has not yet emerged.\r\n Atypical bacteria such as chlamydia, legionella, and mycoplasma have also been implicated at COPD exacerbation, although evidence on their role is confl icting, and these microorganisms might also interact with airway bacteria and viruses. [45] [46] [47] [48] A recent study using real-time PCR detection methods found no role for these three atypical bacteria at COPD exacerbation. 49 Pollution COPD patients can have increased exacerbations and hospital admissions with increasing environmental pollution. 50 In the APHEA study in six European cities, Anderson and colleagues 51 reported a signifi cant eff ect of air pollution levels on hospital admission for COPD, and similar results have also been seen in Taiwan 52 and Brazil. 53 However, common pollutants, especially nitrogen oxides and particulates, can interact with viral infection in asthma 54 to precipitate exacerbation rather than acting alone, and a similar mechanism might occur in COPD. A study from Hong Kong has shown adverse eff ects of ambient concentrations of air pollutants (sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxides, ozone, and particulate matter with an diameter of less than 10 \u00b5g\/m\u00b3 [PM 10 ] and 2\u00b75 \u00b5g\/m\u00b3 [PM 2\u00b75 ]) on hospitalisation rates for COPD, especially during the winter season. 55 Thus measures to improve air quality can have an eff ect on exacerbation frequency.\r\n In general, exacerbations become both more frequent and more severe as the severity of the underlying COPD increases. 56 However, there remain large diff erences in yearly exacerbation incidence rates between patients of similar COPD severity. 1 There is no agreed defi nition of a patient with frequent exacerbations, but in several studies they were defi ned as those with yearly exacerbation rates of greater than the median for the study, usually around three symptom-defi ned exacerbations per year or two per year if the exacerbation is defi ned by the requirement for therapy with courses of antibiotics, corticosteroids, or both.\r\n Patients with a history of frequent exacerbations have worse quality of life than patients with a history of less frequent exacerbations, and have consistent exacerbation frequencies when studied from year to year. 1 These patients also have an increased risk of hospital admission 57 and greater mortality (fi gure 2). 58 A UK study suggested that COPD exacerbations do not aff ect lung function decline, though this study was done in men of working age with fairly good lung function. 59 However, results of subsequent studies suggest that exacerbations do play a part in disease progression in patients who are active 61 although this eff ect is fairly small, at around 25% of the total decline in lung function. This observation might be due to the fact that not all exacerbations recover to baseline levels of symptoms and lung function. 3 The results of one audit showed that around 30% of patients seen at hospital with an index exacerbation will be seen again and possibly readmitted with a recurrent exacerbation within 8 weeks. 62 Patients with a history of frequent exacerbations also have increased airway infl ammation, 9 which could also contribute to the disease progression. 63 Why some patients have frequent exacerbations is not clear, although they possibly have increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infection. 25 Thus this group of COPD patients is important for targeting interventions that have the potential of reducing exacerbation frequency. COPD exacerbations have functional consequences. Spruit and colleagues 64 have shown that peripheral muscle weakness worsens during exacerbation, potentially contributing to reduced functionality and therefore to deconditioning (loss of fi tness). Patients who do not improve their walking distance within a month after exacerbation are more prone to be readmitted to hospital. 65 Donaldson and colleagues 66 have also shown that exacerbations are associated with a decline in outdoor activity for up to 5 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Patients who have frequent exacerbations had a faster decline in functional status, as measured by time spent outdoors, than patients with infrequent exacerbations (fi gure 3). Thus, patients with frequent exacerbations are more likely to become housebound and are a subpopulation that needs targeting for pulmonary rehabilitation programmes.\r\n COPD is associated with other comorbid conditions, and patients who are admitted to hospital are more likely to have associated comorbid conditions such as ischaemic heart disease, pneumonia, and diabetes than patients without a diagnosis of COPD. 67 Increasing blood glucose concentrations have been shown to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COPD exacerbations. 68 Thus the disease burden of COPD exacerbations is likely to be much higher when these comorbidities are taken into account. 67 There have been several reports of associations between pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and COPD exacerbation. [69] [70] [71] Exacerbations could trigger pulmonary embolic events, since acute infections are known to predispose to deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. 72 There might also be diagnostic diffi culties because both COPD exacerbations and pulmonary embolism might present solely with dyspnoea. However, a recent study has shown that pulmonary embolism is not a common feature in uncomplicated exacerbations, 73 but some patients with exacerbations can have prolonged recovery periods, complicated by respiratory failure and comorbidity, when the risk of pulmonary embolism could become greater.\r\n A few studies have shown that a decreased exacerbation rate is associated with improved quality of life. [74] [75] [76] [77] Thus lowering the exacerbation rate would be expected to decrease hospitalisations and have important health economic benefi ts. Several classes of drugs with potential for reducing exacerbations have been investigated, with variable evidence for their use: vaccines, bacterial extracts, inhaled steroids and long acting bronchodilators, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and mucolytic agents.\r\n There are several studies of infl uenza and pneumococcal vaccinations, which are now routinely recommended for all patients with COPD of signifi cant severity. [78] [79] [80] [81] One study that reviewed the outcome of infl uenza vaccination in a cohort of elderly patients with chronic lung disease found that infl uenza vaccination is associated with signifi cant health benefi ts with fewer outpatient visits, fewer hospitalisations, and reduced mortality. 78 A Cochrane database review of four studies in COPD saw no evidence of effi cacy for injectable antipneumococcal vaccines; 82 however, in a study of the 23 serotype pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in COPD patients, Alfageme and colleagues 83 showed that the vaccine was eff ective in the prevention of community acquired pneumonia, compared with placebo in patients younger than 65 years or those with severe airfl ow obstruction. However, no diff erence in mortality between the groups was seen in the study. Larger well designed studies are needed to examine the eff ects of pneumococcal vaccine in patients older than 65 years with COPD. Immunostimulatory agents have also been reported to reduce COPD exacerbation frequency. 10 years ago, a study of the immunostimulant OM-85, a detoxifi ed oral immunoactive bacterial extract, reported a reduction in the severe complications of exacerbations and hospital admissions in COPD patients, with a follow-up study confi rming the economic benefi ts of using this agent. 84 A recent randomised study has also found benefi ts but the patients had heterogeneous pathology. 85 A systematic review of 13 trials involving 2066 patients saw no consistent evidence of a benefi t though the agent is currently in use in Europe. 86 Further study is needed to understand the mechanisms of action of this immunostimulant before its role in COPD can be defi ned.\r\n The success of oral corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD exacerbations with reduction of hospital length of stay 87, 88 has prompted much interest in the use of inhaled steroids to reduce exacerbation frequency in COPD. One of the early studies, the ISOLDE (Inhaled Steroid in Obstructive Lung Disease in Europe) study, was a 3-year study, powered to detect a signifi cant change in FEV 1 decline, was negative for the primary outcome but showed that exacerbation frequency can be reduced with inhaled steroids by about 25%. 74 Generally the eff ect of inhaled steroids was greater in patients with more impaired lung function, suggesting that this is the group to target with long-term inhaled steroid therapy. 89 In another study from the USA 90 (The Lung Health Study), the inhaled steroid (triamcinolone) group had signifi cantly fewer visits to a physician due to respiratory illness, suggesting that triamcinolone also reduced the frequency of COPD exacerbations.\r\n Inhaled long-acting beta 2 agonist (LABA) therapy has been shown to cause small reductions in exacerbation frequency, although most studies involved short periods of therapy at 12 weeks. [91] [92] Mahler and colleagues 91 found that the time to the fi rst exacerbation was longer with therapy with the long-acting beta agonist salmeterol, although the overall number of exacerbations during the study was small. The larger TORCH study 93 of 6112 COPD patients reported that salmeterol reduced exacerbation frequency compared with placebo over a 3-year period. In another study comparing salmeterol with the short-acting ipratropium and placebo, there was no diff erence in the eff ect in either treatment arm on exacerbation frequency. 94 Rossi and colleagues 95 compared two diff erent dosages of the inhaled bronchodilator formoterol with placebo or theophylline and concluded that formoterol was more eff ective and better tolerated than therapeutically appropriate doses of oral slow-release theophylline in symptomatic COPD patients. Furthermore, two studies reported that formoterol had no eff ect on total exacerbation frequency relative to placebo, though these studies did fi nd that the rates of steroid-treated exacerbations were decreased in the formoterol group. 96, 97 The balance of evidence favours a positive role for LABAs in decreasing exacerbation frequency, which might be the result of the inhibitory eff ect of \u03b2 2 -adrenoceptor agonists on plasma exudation and neutrophil migration, or possibly indicating an additional reduction in the expression of adhesion molecules. However, the likely pathway of action could be through a synergistic action on airway infl ammatory cells in those patients already receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy. 98, 99 All of the major recent studies of combination therapy 75, 93, 96, 97 have reported that the combination of inhaled steroid and LABA is more eff ective than either individual drug alone in reducing exacerbation frequency. Thus, inhaled steroids are unlikely to be used as sole therapy for COPD patients in the future. The data from the TORCH study have confi rmed the eff ectiveness of the inhaled steroid-LABA combination in reducing exacerbation frequency, and the study has reported that the combination reduces hospital admission rates in COPD patients. 93 However, most of these studies have been done in patients with more severe COPD with an FEV 1 at less than 60% predicted (fi gure 4). The eff ect of the inhaled steroid-LABA combination on reducing exacerbations in patients with milder COPD is not clear, especially in those patients who have an increased exacerbation frequency.\r\n Long-acting anticholinergic agents such as tiotropium also reduce exacerbation frequency, and tiotropium has been shown to reduce exacerbations by 24%, compared with ipratropium when studied over a 1-year period. 76, 77 Niewoehner and colleagues 100 in a well designed study have confi rmed the potential of tiotropium to reduce exacerbation frequency and also have shown a reduction in hospitalisation. Tiotropium does not have any known anti-infl ammatory eff ect, 101 and its eff ect on reducing exacerbations is most likely due to the reduction of dynamic hyperinfl ation that is the major cause of dyspnoea in COPD (fi gure 5). 19 The combination of tiotropium with inhaled LABA and inhaled steroids has been explored in the Optimal Study. 102 This randomised trial compared tiotropium-fl uticasone-salmeterol versus tiotropium-salmeterol versus tiotropium-placebo, and the triple combination reduced hospitalisation as a result of exacerbation, but not the total number of exacerbations. However, a trend was seen in the reduction of the number of exacerbations with the triple combination, which failed to reach signifi cance possibly due to the small size of the study and the high dropout rate. Triple therapy could be more eff ective than dual therapy, but further studies of these combinations are required with adequately powered studies.\r\n The phosphodiesterase inhibitors now form a class of non-steroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs that might be useful in the prevention of COPD exacerbations. Studies of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline have suggested that small reductions in exacerbation rates can be achieved with therapy, 95, 103 though further studies are needed on the eff ect of low dose theophylline on exacerbation frequency in COPD. Two new receptorspecifi c phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been studied in COPD: cilomilast and rofl umilast, which are both phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors. A trial of cilomilast in COPD patients showed reduction in exacerbations in the cilomilast group. 104 Two studies of rofl umilast in COPD have been recently reported: Rabe and colleagues 105 have reported a reduction in exacerbations after 24 weeks therapy with rofl umilast, while Calverley and colleagues 106 studied rofl umilast in patients with GOLD stage III and IV in a 1-year trial and showed no overall eff ect on exacerbation rate, although patients with severe disease (GOLD stage IV) had fewer during the study period. Prevention of COPD exacerbations using this class of drugs is evolving and newer agents and more eff ective phosphodiesterase inhibitors will be developed with fewer adverse events. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 has an important role as a key mediator in COPD and has been a target for study. However, a trial of the anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody, infl iximab, showed no benefi t on any of the main trial outcomes and no eff ect of the therapy on exacerbation rate. 107 \r\n The BRONCUS trial 108 using N-acetylcysteine has shown no overall benefi t of mucolytics on reduction of COPD exacerbations, except a small eff ect was noted in those patients who were not taking inhaled steroids. A follow-up meta-analysis of 26 randomised trials involving mucolytic therapy in COPD revealed a 20% reduction in exacerbations, with a large number of patients treated with mucolytics having no exacerbations. 109 A study from North America has shown that small airways occluded with infl ammatory exudate in COPD patients were associated with early death. This fi nding might stimulate further research into the role of mucolytic agents in COPD therapy. 110 However, the consensus view is that the evidence for mucolytics preventing COPD exacerbations is not convincing; this view is supported by the GOLD guidelines, although mucolytics are still used quite widely in some parts of the world.\r\n Long-term antibiotic treatment has been used by physicians in clinical practice previously in patients with very frequent exacerbations, either continuously or in rotation, though there is little evidence for their eff ectiveness. There are some problems with using long-term antibiotics as resistant bacteria could emerge and cause increased airway infl ammation and exacerbations. However, in view of the presence of lower airway bacterial colonisation in these patients 111 and data from Patel and colleagues 112 that such colonisation is related to exacerbation frequency, there has been renewed interest in this type of intervention and some continuing studies will soon be reporting their fi ndings.\r\n Pulmonary rehabilitation is now an accepted intervention in COPD and although it has important benefi ts for patients, its eff ect on preventing exacerbations is less clear. 113 In a randomised trial from South Wales, UK, Griffi ths and colleagues 114 treated with a pulmonary rehabilitation programme including exercise training and education had shorter hospital stays than the control group and fewer primary-care home visits. This fi nding suggests that a course of pulmonary rehabilitation might reduce exacerbation severity rather than frequency by increasing the patient's knowledge of COPD and how to access health care or self-manage during an exacerbation. Pulmonary rehabilitation could thus reduce hospital stay but also encourage early presentation for exacerbation therapy, which reduces exacerbation length and thus the severity of the event. 115 Garcia-Aymerich and colleagues 116 have also shown in a 1-year study that patients with high levels of usual physical activity were at reduced risk of readmission to hospital. An intensive disease-specifi c self-management programme done in Canada has been shown to reduce hospital admission rate, 117 though a systematic review of nurse-led interventions failed to show a consistent eff ect on hospitalisation). 118 Casas and colleagues 119 have extended this approach by using a similar integrated care plan in two diff erent environments (Barcelona, Spain, and Leuven, Belgium), with similar eff ects on decreased readmission rates for COPD exacerbation. Patients with COPD are elderly, often with a degree of cognitive impairment and might have diffi culty with selfmanagement at exacerbations. How optimum community support should be provided for patients who are at particular risk of hospital admission is not clear.\r\n Long-term oxygen therapy has several benefi ts in COPD patients who are chronically hypoxaemic, including reducing mortality, anxiety, and depression. [120] [121] [122] In an epidemiological study, Garcia-Aymerich and colleagues 52 noted that patients with hypoxaemia but not treated with long-term oxygen therapy had a higher risk of hospital admission. Another observational study from the Danish Oxygen Register 123 has also suggested that long-term oxygen therapy reduces hospital admission rate. Controlled studies on home oxygen therapy and COPD exacerbations are diffi cult, since withholding therapy in a control hypoxaemic group would not be ethically justifi able.\r\n COPD patients with chronic respiratory failure are particularly susceptible to exacerbations. After the early experience of domiciliary long-term non-invasive ventilation in patients with chest wall and neuromuscular disease, non-invasive ventilation has also been assessed in patients with hypercapnic COPD. Early observations on the eff ect of non-invasive ventilation in COPD showed a signifi cant benefi cial eff ect on health status, although data for exacerbations were not recorded. 124 Because health status is such an important determinant of exacerbation frequency, 1 improvement in health status could be due to a reduction of exacerbation frequency. In a controlled study lasting a year, no eff ect was seen of non-invasive ventilation on exacerbations but there was a reduction in hospital admission at the 3-month follow-up point. 125 Thus, larger controlled studies are now required to assess the eff ect of non-invasive ventilation on exacerbation in hypercapnic COPD patients, particularly at risk of hospital admission.\r\n COPD exacerbations are often triggered by airway infection and are an important cause of morbidity, impairment of health status, and mortality. Although many pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions prevent exacerbations, the degree of reduction in exacerbation frequency is still restricted and we now need new interventions to be urgently developed and studied in well designed and adequately powered randomised trials. Combinations of these interventions will probably be most eff ective and this approach will need future development and assessment. One of the main objectives of therapy for COPD is to reduce the morbidity associated with exacerbations and thus improve the quality of life of patients with this disabling condition.\r\n JAW has received research grant funding from AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Boehringer Ingelheim, who all manufacture pharmacological therapies for prevention of COPD exacerbations.

Exacerbations are usually infl ammatory events, with several airway and systemic infl ammatory markers increasing. Thus we largely selected publications in the past 10 years but did not exclude commonly referenced and highly regarded older publications. We also searched the reference lists of articles identifi ed by this search strategy and selected those we judged relevant. However, it is an overview of current thinking on the importance of COPD exacerbations and how to prevent them based on research evidence and clinical practice. Further research will aid in the understanding of mechanisms of COPD exacerbations and will lead to the development of more specifi c biomarkers. COPD exacerbations are associated with increased upper and lower airway and systemic infl ammation (fi gure 1). 14 In one study, where biopsies were done at exacerbation in patients with chronic bronchitis, increased airway eosinophilia was reported, although the patients studied had only mild COPD. 10 Modest increases were seen in neutrophils, T lymphocytes (CD3), and TNF alpha positive cells. However, studies in intubated patients with COPD are diffi cult, since the results can be complicated by secondary infection. 13, 16 Systemic infl ammation increases at exacerbation and although the causes of this response in COPD are not clear, there is probably a spill-over of infl ammatory markers from the lungs. 13 Systemic infl am mation increases when the exacerbation is associated with bacterial and viral infection. 17 Several infl ammatory markers increase at exacerbation, such as plasma fi brinogen and CRP, that have been linked to increased cardiovascular risk. 19 Generally the more severe the underlying disease, the greater the degree of physiological change at exacerbation leading to worsening of airfl ow limitation, and thus the more likely the patient is to develop respiratory failure. There have been few such studies in the developing world, but a study from Hong Kong detected viruses in only 22% of exacerbations. 29 However, this study diff ered from others in the choice of assay and in that samples were taken from the upper airway rather than directly from the lower airway. A smaller study of 14 COPD patients admitted to hospital in Singapore reported that 64% of COPD exacerbations were associated with viruses although, like the Hong Kong study, most were associated with infl uenza virus, 30 which was possibly due to less frequent use of the infl uenza vaccine. Since the introduction of infl uenza immunisation for patients with chronic lung disease, the virus has become a less prominent cause of exacerbation, though it is still likely to be an important factor at times of epidemics. 34 Exacerbations triggered by respiratory viruses are also more severe, associated with longer recovery times, 27 and have more chance of hospital admission than exacerbations where respiratory viruses were not detected. A study investigating the benefi t of antibiotics in more than 300 acute exacerba tions showed a greater treatment success rate in patients treated with antibiotics, especially if their initial presentation was with the symptoms of increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, and purulence, than in patients who did not receive such treatment. Sethi and colleagues 42 have suggested that isolation of a new bacterial strain in COPD patients who were regularly sampled was associated with an in creased risk of an exacerbation. 44 Thus bacterial coinfection with viruses might be of greater importance than bacterial infection alone at COPD exacerbation but consensus within the fi eld has not yet emerged. Atypical bacteria such as chlamydia, legionella, and mycoplasma have also been implicated at COPD exacerbation, although evidence on their role is confl icting, and these microorganisms might also interact with airway bacteria and viruses. [ 49 Pollution COPD patients can have increased exacerbations and hospital admissions with increasing environmental pollution. 56 However, there remain large diff erences in yearly exacerbation incidence rates between patients of similar COPD severity. 58 A UK study suggested that COPD exacerbations do not aff ect lung function decline, though this study was done in men of working age with fairly good lung function. 3 The results of one audit showed that around 30% of patients seen at hospital with an index exacerbation will be seen again and possibly readmitted with a recurrent exacerbation within 8 weeks. 25 Thus this group of COPD patients is important for targeting interventions that have the potential of reducing exacerbation frequency. COPD exacerbations have functional consequences. Patients who do not improve their walking distance within a month after exacerbation are more prone to be readmitted to hospital. 67 Increasing blood glucose concentrations have been shown to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COPD exacerbations. However, a recent study has shown that pulmonary embolism is not a common feature in uncomplicated exacerbations, 73 but some patients with exacerbations can have prolonged recovery periods, complicated by respiratory failure and comorbidity, when the risk of pulmonary embolism could become greater. 10 years ago, a study of the immunostimulant OM-85, a detoxifi ed oral immunoactive bacterial extract, reported a reduction in the severe complications of exacerbations and hospital admissions in COPD patients, with a follow-up study confi rming the economic benefi ts of using this agent. 86 Further study is needed to understand the mechanisms of action of this immunostimulant before its role in COPD can be defi ned. 91] [92] Mahler and colleagues 91 found that the time to the fi rst exacerbation was longer with therapy with the long-acting beta agonist salmeterol, although the overall number of exacerbations during the study was small. The data from the TORCH study have confi rmed the eff ectiveness of the inhaled steroid-LABA combination in reducing exacerbation frequency, and the study has reported that the combination reduces hospital admission rates in COPD patients. The eff ect of the inhaled steroid-LABA combination on reducing exacerbations in patients with milder COPD is not clear, especially in those patients who have an increased exacerbation frequency. Tiotropium does not have any known anti-infl ammatory eff ect, 101 and its eff ect on reducing exacerbations is most likely due to the reduction of dynamic hyperinfl ation that is the major cause of dyspnoea in COPD (fi gure 5). However, a trend was seen in the reduction of the number of exacerbations with the triple combination, which failed to reach signifi cance possibly due to the small size of the study and the high dropout rate. Prevention of COPD exacerbations using this class of drugs is evolving and newer agents and more eff ective phosphodiesterase inhibitors will be developed with fewer adverse events. This fi nding suggests that a course of pulmonary rehabilitation might reduce exacerbation severity rather than frequency by increasing the patient's knowledge of COPD and how to access health care or self-manage during an exacerbation. How optimum community support should be provided for patients who are at particular risk of hospital admission is not clear. 120] [121] [122] In an epidemiological study, Garcia-Aymerich and colleagues 52 noted that patients with hypoxaemia but not treated with long-term oxygen therapy had a higher risk of hospital admission.

It should not, therefore, be used when patients cannot protect their airway. It is not appropriate for all, and the selection of candidates is important (panel 1). For patients with secretion accumulation or a weak cough refl ex, adequate secretion management with manual or mechanical techniques might be advisable before non-invasive ventilation is declared failed or contraindicated. 2, 3 Compared with invasive mechanical ventilation, this type of ventilation achieves the same physiological benefi ts of reduced work of breathing and improved gas exchange. 4 Furthermore, it avoids the complications of intubation and the increased risks of ventilator-associated pneumonia and sinusitis, especially in patients who are immuno suppressed or with comorbidities. 2 We review present and potential uses of non-invasive ventilation in the acute setting, with emphasis on indications outside the intensive care unit. Although continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) does not actively assist inspiration as do all other forms of non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, we class CPAP as a non-invasive mode unless otherwise specifi ed.\r\n The use of non-invasive ventilation varies greatly between hospitals and geographical regions, and has changed over time. Investigators of a worldwide prospective survey of mechanical ventilation noted that use rose from 4% of all ventilators started in 2001, to 11% in 2004. 5 It is increasingly being used in many countries, but frequency of use is highly variable. 6, 7 Non-invasive ventilation is used mainly for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and for cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Use for hypoxic respiratory failure and facilitation of weaning is still infrequent and is mainly done in specialised centres. 7 In Europe, the rate of use of non-invasive ventilation in intensive care units is about 35% of ventilated patients and higher (roughly 60%) in respiratory intensive care units or emergency departments. 8, 9 In North America, this form of ventilation is begun most often in emergency departments, with most patients transferred to intensive care units or step-down units in hospitals that have such facilities. The low rate of use in some hospitals relates to little knowledge about or experience with the technique, insuffi cient technical equipment, and inadequate funding. [9] [10] [11] Despite these limitations, this technique is increasingly being used outside the traditional and respiratory intensive care units, including in emergency departments; postsurgical recovery rooms; 12 cardiology, 13 neurology, 14 and oncology 15 wards; and palliative care units. 16 \r\n In a matched case-control study, Girou and colleagues 17 showed that compared with endotracheal intubation non-invasive ventilation was associated with a lower risk of nosocomial infections (including urinary tract and catheter-related infections), less antibiotic use, shorter lengths of stay in the intensive care units, and lower mortality than was endotracheal intubation. Furthermore, endotracheal intubation is uncomfortable for patients and increases the need for sedation and analgesia, which is an independent factor for extended weaning. 18 During non-invasive ventilation, the need for sedation is usually less than with intubation so that patients maintain better spontaneous breathing, can wean more rapidly, and Review www.thelancet.com Vol 374 July 18, 2009 251 spend less time in the intensive care units. 19 However, it should not be used in patients with contraindications (panel 1). Such patients need prompt intubation and inadvisable use places them at risk of need for emergency intubation with its attendant morbidity and mortality. 20 Non-invasive ventilation can be used in a wide range of disorders that lead to acute respiratory failure. We examine the evidence lending support to applications which are graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine (panel 2). 21 The success of this technique depends not only on the diagnosis of respiratory failure and patients' characteristics but also on when the ventilation is started 22 and the setting in which the patient is treated. 23 Early use of non-invasive ventilation is recommended because the opportunity for a successful start might be lost if delays arise and the patient's underlying disease progresses too far. However, such ventilation can be started too early-ie, when the patient's illness is so mild that no ventilatory assistance is needed and they are more likely to be intolerant than be helped. 24 Thus judgment should be exercised; most practitioners seek evidence of increased dyspnoea and work of breathing (tachypnoea or heightened accessory muscle use). 25 Another advantage of an early start is that patients who are not in immediate life-threatening situations can be managed outside the intensive care units, provided that the ward team has the necessary skills. Hence specialised units (ie, respiratory intensive care, high-dependency) are ideal for provision of non-invasive ventilation to all but the most sick patients because they off er complete non-invasive monitoring systems and higher nurse to patient ratios than are available on general wards.\r\n Patients with acute respiratory acidosis caused by an exacerbation of COPD are the group that benefi ts most from non-invasive ventilation. Early use in patients with COPD who have with mild respiratory acidosis (as low as pH 7\u00b730) and mild-to-moderate respiratory distress prevents further deterioration, and thus avoids endotracheal intubation and improves survival compared with standard medical therapy. 26 In a large multicentre trial in patients with mild-to-moderate acidotic COPD who were admitted to a respiratory ward, Plant and colleagues 26 noted that intubation and mortality rates were lower with non-invasive ventilation than with standard therapy alone, but subgroup analysis showed that these rates did not diff er when pH at enrolment was less than 7\u00b730. The investigators surmised that these patients with low pHs might have fared better in an intensive care unit than in the respiratory ward.\r\n Strong evidence of effi cacy (from randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses) and low risk of failure (10-20%) means that use of non-invasive ventilation to avoid intubation in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD and acute respiratory failure (pH 7\u00b730-7\u00b734) is regarded as the ventilatory therapy of fi rst choice and can be safely administered in appropriately monitored and staff ed areas outside intensive care. [27] [28] [29] Patients with a low pH are still candidates for this technique but transfer to a closely monitored location is strongly advisable.\r\n Non-invasive ventilation has been used to treat acute respiratory failure in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, mainly in emergency departments. Investigators of several meta-analyses [30] [31] [32] concluded that this technique, including CPAP, is better than is standard medical therapy for reduction of intubation rate. Furthermore, they noted that CPAP reduces mortality. This conclusion was not supported in a multicentre trial 33 that compared oxygen therapy alone, CPAP, and non-invasive pressure support ventilation. The physiological improvements were faster with non-invasive ventilation than with oxygen alone but without a statistically signifi cant eff ect on intubation or mortality rates. However, the very low intubation rate (<3%) raises questions as to whether the patients' population was similar to that of other studies. [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] Meta-analyses 30-32 that compared non-invasive ventilation with CPAP alone in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema showed that intubation and mortality rates did not diff er, although investigators of some studies noted more rapid improvements in dyspnoea scores, oxygenation, and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) with non-invasive ventilation than with CPAP. Nonetheless, because of ease of use, some clinicians regard CPAP as fi rst-line treatment for cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in patients who do not have hypercapnoea. 39 According to the European Cardiology Task Force 40 for diagnosis and treatment of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, non-invasive ventilation and CPAP are regarded as fi rst-line treatments together with standard medical therapy when acute respiratory failure ensues.\r\n Major abdominal and thoracic surgeries are often complicated postoperatively by hypoxaemia and respiratory failure, which is sometimes fatal. Pulmonary atelectasis after major surgery is frequent and might predispose patients to pneumonia. In randomised trials CPAP reduced atelectasis and prevented pneumonia more eff ectively than did standard therapy after upper abdominal surgery, 41 and non-invasive ventilation substantially ameliorated gas exchange and abnormal changes in pulmonary function after gastrosplasty in patients who were obese. 42 Preventive use for a week before 43 or immediately after thoracic, 44 cardiac 45 or vascular 46 surgeries might mitigate loss of lung volume and development of atelectasis while easing recovery. Furthermore, use of non-invasive ventilation to treat early acute respiratory failure after lung resection improved survival in one randomised study. 47 These results lend support to use of CPAP or non-invasive ventilation in the postoperative setting, but more data are needed before specifi c recommendations can be made.\r\n Acute respiratory failure in patients who are immunocompromised often signals a terminal phase of the underlying disease, with short survival time and high costs of admission to intensive care. 48 Early use of non-invasive ventilation could be very helpful, as shown by randomised studies in intensive care units that compared this technique with standard treatment. In patients receiving a solid-organ transplant and who had hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure, such ventilation reduced intubation rate, complications, mortality, and duration of stay in intensive care. 49 In a second study, 50 this technique lowered intubation, complication, and mor tality rates compared with standard therapy in patients with hypoxaemia and bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates and immunosuppression secondary to haemato logical malig nancies, transplantation, or HIV infection. In view of the risk of admitting patients who are immunosuppressed to intensive care, some institutions now use non-invasive ventilation or CPAP early in haematology wards, either via a face mask or helmet, to avert transfer to intensive care. 15 Obesity is an epidemic health and socioeconomic problem in many countries and predisposes people to chronic alveolar hypoventilation, usually in association with obstructive sleep apnoea. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is defi ned as obesity with hypercapnia and can lead to acute respiratory acidosis during an exacerbation. Some case reports and observational studies suggest that non-invasive ventilation can ameliorate alveolar hypoventilation and avoid intubation in this situation. 51, 52 Patients with severe irreversible chronic diseases often eschew invasive mechanical ventilation when they present with acute respiratory failure and such ventilatory assistance might even be medically inappropriate for terminal stages. 53 Non-invasive ventilation could be used as an intermediate step to relieve symptoms and to achieve survival in hospital in some patients. 54 Two large US studies 55, 56 in patients with acute respiratory failure and do-not-intubate orders reported that roughly half of those treated with this technique survived and were discharged. Underlying disease was an important determinant of survival: patients with congestive heart failure had better survival rates than did those with COPD, and these rates were much better than were those for patients with pneumonia or cancer.\r\n Observational studies found that non-invasive ventilation can be eff ective in relieving respiratory distress in patients admitted to either a respiratory unit 57 or a palliative care unit. 16 Early data from an ongoing multicentre randomised study 58 of non-invasive ventila tion versus oxygen supplementation showed that it relieves signs of respiratory distress for at least 6 h after initiation and patients needed less morphine than did controls given oxygen. Patients with congestive heart failure and COPD who have do-not-intubate orders respond well to non-invasive ventilation, but use for other diagnoses and palliation, although appealing, needs further study. 59 Two randomised controlled studies 60,61 assessed use of non-invasive ventilation during severe, non-life-threatening asthma attacks before development of acute respiratory failure. The fi rst study 60 showed improved fl ow rates and reduced admissions with this technique compared with sham non-invasive ventilation. The second study 61 reported similar conclusions with high infl ation pressures but not with low pressures or standard medical therapy. A trial can be considered for prevention of acute respiratory failure in patients with asthma who do not respond adequately to initial bronchodilator therapy. Whether this technique is eff ective for treatment of overt acute respiratory failure in patients with asthma is unknown.\r\n A subset of patients-eg, those who are immunocompromised, have pneumonia and pulmonary fi brosis with a low ratio for arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) to fraction of inspired oxygen (F I O 2 ), or have bleeding diatheses-are at high risk for developing respiratory failure during fi breoptic bronchoscopy. Two randomised trials showed that either CPAP alone 62 or non-invasive ventilation 62 given via a full face mask improved oxygenation, and in one study 63 reduced postprocedure respiratory failure in patients with severe hypoxaemia. Similar fi ndings with the helmet were reported. 64 Although evidence lends support to use of such ventilation during fi breoptic bronchoscopy to avoid intubation, close monitoring and ready availability of equipment for emergency intubation are necessary.\r\n By contrast with use of non-invasive ventilation on a ward, the closely monitored intensive-care setting allows safe application of this technique even in very sick patients. To manage such patients non-invasively, including those with COPD exacerbations with severe respiratory acidosis (ie, pH<7\u00b730), staff with much experience in this technique are needed, who are prepared to intubate promptly if goals are not met (ie, haemodynamic stability, adequate oxygenation, good cooperation). 65, 66 Delays in intubation of these patients runs the risk of unanticipated respiratory or cardiac arrest with attendant morbidity and mortality. Predictors of failure for non-invasive ventilation for hypercapnic respiratory failure are no improvement or a fall in pH, no change or a rise in breathing frequency after 1-2 h, high-acuity illness at admission (simplifi ed acute physiology score II >34), and lack of cooperation. Predictors for hypoxaemic respiratory failure are no or a minimum rise in the ratio of PaO 2 to F I O 2 after 1-2 h, Nasal pillows Helmet patients older than 40 years (one study), 67 high acuity illness at admission (simplifi ed acute physiology score >34), presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, community acquired pneumonia with or without sepsis, and multiorgan system failure. Hypoxaemic respiratory failure denotes patients with dyspnoea and tachypnoea with ratios of PaO 2 to F I O 2 less than 200 and a non-COPD diagnosis such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, or cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Several clinical trials [68] [69] [70] have studied non-invasive ventilation in the intensive care unit to avoid intubation in such patients, but results are controversial. Major confounders of these studies were the large diff erences between enrolled patients in type of respiratory failure and severity of illness. For example, Confalonieri and colleagues 71 assessed use of this technique in patients with acute respiratory failure due to severe community-acquired pneumonia, including patients with and without COPD. Although non-invasive ventilation signifi cantly reduced need for endotracheal intubation and length of hospital stay, in a subgroup analysis only patients with COPD benefi ted. Observational studies 72, 73 suggest that noninvasive ventilation is not useful for the avoidance of intubation when hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure is caused by community-acquired pneumonia in the absence of COPD.\r\n Only one randomised trial 74 has thus far investigated use of this technique as an alternative to intubation in patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure. Antonelli and co-workers 74 compared this technique with immediate intubation in patients with severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure who did not improve despite aggressive medical therapy. Oxygenation improved similarly within the fi rst hour in both groups, and only 31% of patients in the non-invasive ventilation group needed intubation. Patients in the immediate intubation group developed serious complications, especially infections, more frequently than did those in the non-invasive group. In survivors, the duration of mechanical ventilation and stay in intensive care was shorter in those assigned to the non-invasive group.\r\n Thus, although some studies suggest benefi t, the use of non-invasive ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome or severe community-acquired pneumonia is controversial and not recommended routinely. 75 Results of a survey 76 in three intensive care units, with staff highly skilled in this technique, showed that only 30% of patients with a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome met criteria for a trial of this type of ventilation. Of these patients, intubation was avoided in 54%, which was associated with much lowered morbidity (by about 40%) and mortality rates (roughly 30%). This fi nding suggests that in real-life situations and in expert hands only about 15% of such patients can be treated successfully with this technique; mainly those with a low severity of illness, not in shock, and rapid improvement in oxygenation after therapy is started.\r\n Several randomised trials showed that non-invasive ventilation can be safely and successfully used to enable weaning from mechanical ventilation in stable patients recovering from an episode of hypercapnic acute respiratory failure (ie, COPD exacerbations) 77, 78 and even in those who previously had an unsuccessful spontaneous breathing trial. 79, 80 Respiratory failure after extubation occurs in about 15% of extubated patients, with an inhospital mortality that approaches 30-40%. 81 Two randomised trials 82, 83 have shown that non-invasive ventilation applied immediately after extubation in patients considered at high risk of extubation failure (ie, elderly patients, and those with repeated failed weaning attempts, congestive heart failure, hypercapnia, hypoxaemia, acidaemia, and many comor bidities) lowered the rate of reintubation. Further more, in one study, mortality in the intensive care unit decreased in a subgroup of patients with hyper capnia. 83 However, results from two previous randomised trials 84, 85 showed no reduction in reintubation rates, and one 85 reported a signifi cantly higher mortality in the intensive care unit in the non-invasive group, associated with longer delays in reintubation than in the control group (12 h vs 2 h) . These fi ndings led some researchers to conclude that non-invasive ventilation should not be used for extubation failure. However, only 10% of enrolled patients had COPD, perhaps predisposing to less favourable fi ndings than seen in other studies. Furthermore, outcomes were improved in the group of controls who crossed over to non-invasive ventilation after they met criteria for respiratory failure,which suggests that some patients randomly assigned to this group started too early before they were clearly good candidates. Although controversial, accumulating evidence suggests that this technique has a role in treatment of extubation failure, but mainly in patients with hypercapnic and congestive heart failure who are at high risk for extubation failure. Furthermore, patients should be monitored closely to avoid delays in intubation.\r\n Application of non-invasive ventilation for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and other airborne diseases has generated debate. On the basis of the Toronto experience 86 with SARS, in which some caregivers contracted the syndrome when a patient was intubated after failure of non-invasive ventilation, use of this technique was discouraged for patients with this disease. However, two subsequent observational studies 87, 88 from China reported no evidence of viral spread to caregivers who took appropriate precautions. In the event of an avian infl uenza pandemic, ventilator resources will probably be severely strained, and non-invasive ventilation might off er a means to support some aff ected patients. However, some clinicians consider this tecnique contra indicated in respiratory failure from communicable respiratory airborne diseases unless used inside a negative-pressure isolation room with strict precautions.\r\n Although bulky and often cumbersome, negative-pressure ventilators such as the so-called iron lung are still used in some countries. 89 Non-invasive ventilation nowadays almost always consists of positive pressure delivered to the upper airway via a mask or other interface, and uses diff erent physiological principles, dependent on the mode of delivery. During CPAP, a constant positive pressure is applied to raise functional residual capacity and open fl ooded alveoli in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. CPAP can lessen left ventricular transmural pressure, reducing afterload and increasing cardiac output, providing an additional rationale for use in the treatment of such patients. 30, 31 CPAP can also be given via a helmet, which can cause diffi culties with synchrony between the patient and ventilator when used with forms of positive-pressure ventilation that need triggering by the patient. 90\r\n \u2022 Explain technique to patient (if competent) \u2022 Choose correct interfaces and size \u2022 Set pressures starting from low levels (ie, pressure support about 8 cm H 2 O and external PEEP 4-5 cm H 2 O) \u2022 Place interface gently over face, holding it in place and start ventilation \u2022 When patient tolerant, tighten straps just enough to avoid major leaks, but not too tight \u2022 Set F I O 2 on ventilator or add low-fl ow oxygen into the circuit, aiming for SO 2 >90% \u2022 Set alarms-low pressure alarm should be above PEEP level \u2022 Be mindful of and try to optimise patent's comfort \u2022 Reset pressures (pressure support increased to get expired tidal volume 6 mL\/kg or higher-raise PEEP external to get oxygen saturation 90% or higher). \u2022 Protect site of skin pressure from the interface (ie, artifi cial skin, wound-care dressing, or rotating interfaces) \u2022 Consider use of mild sedation if patient is agitated \u2022 Monitor comfort, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and dyspnoea every 30 min for 6-12 h then hourly \u2022 Measure arterial blood gases at baseline and within 1 h from start \u2022 Humidifi cation advised for applications longer than 6 hours NIV=non-invasive ventilation; PEEP=end-expiratory positive pressure; FIO2=fraction of inspired oxygen; SO2=oxygen saturation.\r\n Pressure-support ventilation assists inspiration via a preset positive-pressure boost triggered by the patient. The higher pressure is delivered until the inspiratory fl ow rate falls below a target pressure. In this way, pressure-support ventilation allows the patient to set not only breathing rate but also inspiratory and expiratory durations, the feature that distinguishes it from other ventilator modes. Bilevel ventilation, the combination of pressure support to reduce inspiratory work and extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure to counterbalance intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, achieves a greater reduction in work of breathing than does either mode alone, at least in patients with COPD. 91 Pressure-control ventilation, 92 like pressure-support ventilation, fl uctuates between high inspiratory and low expiratory pressures, but contrasts with pressure-support ventilation in that the ventilator cycles into expiration when a preset inspiratory time is reached so that the patient is unable to control the duration of inspiration. Proportional-assist ventilation 93 targets spontaneous inspiratory fl ow rate as a surrogate of patients' eff ort and might improve synchrony between patient and ventilator and tolerance in some patients. Although this mode might be more comfortable and needs fewer adjustments than some pressure-support modes, 93 it is more complex to use than pressure-support ventilation and has not been widely adopted. Pressure-support ventilation, pressure-control ventilation, and pro portional-assist ventilation have been used alone or in combination with extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure in treatment of both acute hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure.\r\n Interfaces connect the patient's airway to the ventilator tubing. Six types of interfaces are commercially available that can be used to apply positive pressure to the upper airway during an episode of acute respiratory failure (fi gure): full-face (or oronasal) mask, total face mask, nasal mask, mouthpieces, nasal pillows or plugs, and a helmet. For acute applications, most clinicians use face masks (total or full), then nasal masks, and to a lesser extent other interfaces 94 (panel 3).\r\n Nasal bridge ulcers develop less often than they did previously because of use of soft silicone seals, lessened strap tension, and use of artifi cial skin at the fi rst sign of skin reddening. Tightening straps excessively is strongly discouraged because of discomfort and risk of ulcers and air leaking might be increased. 95 Although full-face masks are tolerated better than nasal masks initially and are the preferred interface in the acute care setting, 96 both facial and nasal masks improve arterial blood gases equally 97 and patients might tolerate the nasal mask better than the face mask if they have claustrophobia or a frequent productive cough. 98 Skill of the caregivers and their extent of experience in use of non-invasive ventilation are important to the success of this technique (panel 4). 99, 100 Thus, as the skills of staff develop, they might be able to successfully treat very sick patients. Additionally, the use of protocols to guide use might improve selection of appropriate patients. 101 Although Chevrolet and co-workers 102 characterised non-invasive ventilation as excessively demanding on personnel time, subsequent studies 26, 103 have shown that, despite taking about 30-60 min longer, initiation with invasive mechanical ventilation is rated by staff as no more diffi cult to administer than is invasive mechanical ventilation.\r\n Optimum staffi ng and location for delivery depend on acuity of the patient and their severity of illness, monitoring capabilities of the unit, and experience of the staff . 23 Several factors should be considered before a patient is transferred from intensive care to a ward-eg, patients should not need invasive monitoring (arterial lines) or inotropes, nurse to patient ratio should be low (ie, more than one to four), and staff s' skill needs to be adequate to assess when non-invasive ventilation is failing and the patient needs to be transferred to a protected environment. Patients should be able to call for help if needed and pass a weaning test of more than 15 min without serious respiratory distress or oxygen desaturation. Finally, patients should have no need for high concentrations of oxygen supplementation (ie, F I O 2 >60%).\r\n Ventilators and monitoring systems have improved and might be important in the success of non-invasive ventilation. Specifi cally, most new ventilators have modes that compensate for air leaks, improved and sometimes adjustable triggering, systems to achieve best possible synchrony, and minimise rebreathing of carbon dioxide. 104, 105 Additionally, humid ifi cation of the upper airway is important to improve comfort and tolerance. Heated passover humifi diers might reduce work of breathing and carbon dioxide accumulation compared with heat and moisture exchangers, mainly because dead space and resistance are lessened with the non-invasive technique. 106 Eff ectiveness of non-invasive ventilation in specifi c diseases is well documented and quantifi ed ( exacerbations of COPD with a theoretical model that used a decision-tree analysis constructed from a meta-analysis of randomised trials. They concluded that non-invasive ventilation was very cost-eff ective. Plant and co-workers 110 reported that when implemented on a ward, this technique reduces costs (by avoiding admission to intensive care) and improves outcomes compared with traditional medical treatment. Furthermore, the reduced rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia achieved with non-invasive ventilation not only off ers clinical benefi ts for patients but also might have fi nancial advantages for hospitals. For example, the cost of respiratory failure complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia is very high, which creates a strong fi nancial incentive for hospitals to prevent this potentially life-threatening and expensive complication. 111\r\n Non-invasive ventilation has an important role in the management of respira tory failure in acute-care hospitals. Its use to treat acute respiratory failure related to COPD exacerbations, cardio genic pulmonary oedema, and patients in immuno suppressed states has gained wide acceptance. Many other potential applications are undergoing further investiga tion. Furthermore, because intensive care units are often full, use of this technique in other settings is becoming common in many hospitals, but patients should be selected carefully to assure safety. We expect expanded use of non-invasive ventilation as new applications are explored and caregivers develop skill in the technique, but caution should be exercised to restrict use to appropriate applications (ie, avoiding patients with contraindications or excessive delays in intubation). Much variability exists between institutions in how often, with which mode, and in which setting this technique is applied and eff orts should be made to ensure that acquisition of skills helps to narrow these diff erences.\r\n SN undertook an independent database search, wrote and revised the manuscript, developed the fi gures, tables, and references list; and obtained copyright of images in fi gure 1.

Nonetheless, because of ease of use, some clinicians regard CPAP as fi rst-line treatment for cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in patients who do not have hypercapnoea. In randomised trials CPAP reduced atelectasis and prevented pneumonia more eff ectively than did standard therapy after upper abdominal surgery, 41 and non-invasive ventilation substantially ameliorated gas exchange and abnormal changes in pulmonary function after gastrosplasty in patients who were obese. 54 Two large US studies 55, 56 in patients with acute respiratory failure and do-not-intubate orders reported that roughly half of those treated with this technique survived and were discharged. Observational studies found that non-invasive ventilation can be eff ective in relieving respiratory distress in patients admitted to either a respiratory unit 57 or a palliative care unit. The fi rst study 60 showed improved fl ow rates and reduced admissions with this technique compared with sham non-invasive ventilation. Similar fi ndings with the helmet were reported. To manage such patients non-invasively, including those with COPD exacerbations with severe respiratory acidosis (ie, pH<7\u00b730), staff with much experience in this technique are needed, who are prepared to intubate promptly if goals are not met (ie, haemodynamic stability, adequate oxygenation, good cooperation). Predictors for hypoxaemic respiratory failure are no or a minimum rise in the ratio of PaO 2 to F I O 2 after 1-2 h, Nasal pillows Helmet patients older than 40 years (one study), 67 high acuity illness at admission (simplifi ed acute physiology score >34), presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, community acquired pneumonia with or without sepsis, and multiorgan system failure. Major confounders of these studies were the large diff erences between enrolled patients in type of respiratory failure and severity of illness. Although non-invasive ventilation signifi cantly reduced need for endotracheal intubation and length of hospital stay, in a subgroup analysis only patients with COPD benefi ted. Patients in the immediate intubation group developed serious complications, especially infections, more frequently than did those in the non-invasive group. Thus, although some studies suggest benefi t, the use of non-invasive ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome or severe community-acquired pneumonia is controversial and not recommended routinely. This fi nding suggests that in real-life situations and in expert hands only about 15% of such patients can be treated successfully with this technique; mainly those with a low severity of illness, not in shock, and rapid improvement in oxygenation after therapy is started. 81 Two randomised trials 82, 83 have shown that non-invasive ventilation applied immediately after extubation in patients considered at high risk of extubation failure (ie, elderly patients, and those with repeated failed weaning attempts, congestive heart failure, hypercapnia, hypoxaemia, acidaemia, and many comor bidities) lowered the rate of reintubation. Although controversial, accumulating evidence suggests that this technique has a role in treatment of extubation failure, but mainly in patients with hypercapnic and congestive heart failure who are at high risk for extubation failure. On the basis of the Toronto experience 86 with SARS, in which some caregivers contracted the syndrome when a patient was intubated after failure of non-invasive ventilation, use of this technique was discouraged for patients with this disease. During CPAP, a constant positive pressure is applied to raise functional residual capacity and open fl ooded alveoli in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. 30, 31 CPAP can also be given via a helmet, which can cause diffi culties with synchrony between the patient and ventilator when used with forms of positive-pressure ventilation that need triggering by the patient. Pressure-support ventilation assists inspiration via a preset positive-pressure boost triggered by the patient. In this way, pressure-support ventilation allows the patient to set not only breathing rate but also inspiratory and expiratory durations, the feature that distinguishes it from other ventilator modes. Bilevel ventilation, the combination of pressure support to reduce inspiratory work and extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure to counterbalance intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, achieves a greater reduction in work of breathing than does either mode alone, at least in patients with COPD. Interfaces connect the patient's airway to the ventilator tubing. Tightening straps excessively is strongly discouraged because of discomfort and risk of ulcers and air leaking might be increased. 106 Eff ectiveness of non-invasive ventilation in specifi c diseases is well documented and quantifi ed ( exacerbations of COPD with a theoretical model that used a decision-tree analysis constructed from a meta-analysis of randomised trials. Many other potential applications are undergoing further investiga tion. Furthermore, because intensive care units are often full, use of this technique in other settings is becoming common in many hospitals, but patients should be selected carefully to assure safety.

Popular discontent with the health system has led to major reforms. To help inform these reforms, we did a comprehensive assessment of disease burden in China, how it changed between 1990 and 2010, and how China's health burden compares with other nations.\r\n We assessed relative performance of China against G20 countries (signifi cantly better, worse, or indistinguishable from the G20 mean) with age-standardised rates and 95% uncertainty intervals.\r\n Findings The leading causes of death in China in 2010 were stroke (1\u00b77 million deaths, 95% UI 1\u00b75-1\u00b78 million), ischaemic heart disease (948 700 deaths, 774 500-1 024 600), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (934 000 deaths, 846 600-1 032 300). Age-standardised YLLs in China were lower in 2010 than all emerging economies in the G20, and only slightly higher than noted in the USA. China had the lowest age-standardised YLD rate in the G20 in 2010. China also ranked tenth (95% UI eighth to tenth) for HALE and 12th (11th to 13th) for life expectancy. YLLs from neonatal causes, infectious diseases, and injuries in children declined substantially between 1990 and 2010. Mental and behavioural disorders, substance use disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders were responsible for almost half of all YLDs. The fraction of DALYs from YLDs rose from 28\u00b71% (95% UI 24\u00b72-32\u00b75) in 1990 to 39\u00b74% (34\u00b79-43\u00b78) in 2010. Leading causes of DALYs in 2010 were cardiovascular diseases (stroke and ischaemic heart disease), cancers (lung and liver cancer), low back pain, and depression. Dietary risk factors, high blood pressure, and tobacco exposure are the risk factors that constituted the largest number of attributable DALYs in China. Ambient air pollution ranked fourth (third to fi fth; the second highest in the G20) and household air pollution ranked fi fth (fourth to sixth; the third highest in the G20) in terms of the age-standardised DALY rate in 2010.\r\n Interpretation The rapid rise of non-communicable diseases driven by urbanisation, rising incomes, and ageing poses major challenges for China's health system, as does a shift to chronic disability. Reduction of population exposures from poor diet, high blood pressure, tobacco use, cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose are public policy priorities for China, as are the control of ambient and household air pollution. These changes will require an integrated government response to improve primary care and undertake required multisectoral action to tackle key risks. Analyses of disease burden provide a useful framework to guide policy responses to the changing disease spectrum in China.","text_body":"China has made enormous strides in improving health in the past few decades. Between 1970 and 2010, male life expectancy increased from 60\u00b74 years to 72\u00b79 years and female life expectancy increased from 63\u00b75 years to 79\u00b70 years; 1 the under-5 mortality rate reduced from 100\u00b76 per 1000 to 12\u00b79 per 1000; 1 and the total fertility rate declined from 4\u00b777 to 1\u00b764 children per woman. 2 Rapidly increasing income per head, an ageing population, and longer lifespans have led to a rapid change in the health profi le of the nation. Some counties within the country, however, remain relatively poor and continue to have a set of health challenges dominated by communicable, maternal, and neonatal causes. 3, 4 China needs to understand and formulate a long-range strategy to tackle several challenges in public health and medical care at the same time.\r\n Before health-care reform was announced in 2009, 5 the Chinese Government was faced with widespread public discontent stemming from unaff ordable access to health care and growing inequalities in access to health care and health status across regions and populations. [6] [7] [8] [9] Health improvement fell short of what China's rapid economic growth should have aff orded. 10 Some previously eliminated infectious diseases re-emerged 11 and incidence of some non-communicable diseases increased. 12, 13 The 2002-03 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak was a wake-up call exposing the inadequacies of the public health protection and surveillance system, and emphasising the important role for government in guidance of the evolution of health in China. Health system reforms focused on delivering improved access to quality clinical care 14 are now underway but can be better informed by a broad assessment of China's progress in health.\r\n Several data systems provide substantial detail about levels and trends in health in China, including various national surveys of health, civil registration, medical certifi cation of causes of death in some cities and counties, 15 the Disease Surveillance Points system, 16 a sophisticated infectious disease surveillance network, 17 population-based cancer registries, 18 a maternal and child surveillance system, 17 and demographic surveys 19, 20 and censuses. 21, 22 Despite these data systems, a comprehensive and comparable assessment of health challenges and how they change over time is not available. Opportunities to compare China's health performance with other countries to learn where China has done well and where scope for improvement exists have thus been limited.\r\n In this report, we use the results of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) to examine in detail the transformation of health in China from 1990 to 2010 and to benchmark health challenges in China to 18 major high-income and rapidly developing countries that are members of the G20.\r\n Detail on the data, approaches to enhancing data quality and comparability, and statistical modelling and metrics for the GBD 2010 have been reported elsewhere. 1, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] In brief, GBD 2010 lists 291 diseases and injuries, organised in a hierarchy. For each of these causes, up to 24 sequelae exist that are clinical outcomes related to specifi c diseases and injuries, such as neuropathy due to diabetes. The study included 1160 sequelae.\r\n The 2010 GBD study used numerous metrics to report results on health loss related to specifi c causes of disease and injury: deaths and death rates, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). YLLs are computed by multiplying the number of deaths in each age group by a reference life expectancy at that age. The life expectancy at birth in the reference life table is 86\u00b70 years based on the lowest reported death rates for each age group across countries in 2010, and is intended to represent an achievable pattern of mortality. 26 Years lived with disability are calculated from the prevalence of a sequela multiplied by the disability weight for that sequela. Disability weights are based on surveys of the general population. 27 DALYs are the sum of YLLs and YLDs. The GBD uses another indicator, healthy life expectancy (HALE), to summarise overall population health in one number, accounting for both length of life and levels of ill health at diff erent ages. 28\r\n Wang and colleagues 1 provide a detailed description on how rates of age-specifi c mortality have been estimated for each sex, country, and year. Appendix p 1 provides details on each of the sources available for measurement of the under-5 mortality rate, and appendix pp 2-3 provides similar information on measuring the probability of death between ages 15 years and 60 years. Available national data sources on the age pattern of mortality provide similar distributions of deaths for individuals aged 15-79 years (appendix pp [4] [5] .\r\n We calculated numbers of deaths and YLLs based on underlying cause of death estimates for 235 of 291 causes of mortality, and for 20 age groups, both sexes, and 187 countries. 24 The appendix p 11 provides a listing of the major sources of information used to assess causes of death in China since 1980, including population-based cancer registry data. We assessed the quality of each data source, and mapped the codes for various Chinese variants of the International Classifi cation of Diseases and Injuries (ICD) tabulation lists to the GBD 2010 cause list. We reassigned deaths assigned to ill-defi ned diagnoses or to disorders that are not likely to be underlying causes of death with standard algorithms. 30, 31 GBD 2010 provides the most comprehensive eff ort to date to enhance the comparability of cause of death data across countries because it adjusts for revisions of the ICD and the redistribution of garbage codes. Garbage codes are causes of death that should not be identifi ed as underlying causes of death but have been entered as the underlying cause of death on death certifi cates. Classic examples of garbage codes include senility or cardiopulmonary arrest. Uncertainty in cause of death estimates has been captured with standard simulation methods by taking 1000 draws 32 for each age, sex, country, year, and cause. 24 Final uncertainty for death numbers and YLLs also refl ects uncertainty in the levels of allcause mortality in each age-sex-country-year.\r\n We undertook prevalence estimation for each sequela with a systematic analysis of published and available unpublished data sources for prevalence, incidence, remission, and excess mortality. For most sequelae, we made estimates on the basis of a database for all age-sex-country-year groups, with a Bayesian metaregression technique developed for the GBD 2010 (DisMod-MR). Several data sources have been used for the estimates of YLDs in China, including published studies, 33 Prevention (CDC) surveillance system. [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] The eff ects of treatment depending on the cause are captured through changes in prevalence, changes in the severity distribution across sequelae (eg, for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and for some injuries diff erent disability weights for treated and untreated outcomes. Access to treatment for injuries is estimated on the basis of an indicator of access to health systems. 29 For GBD 2010, disability weights were measured for 220 unique health states that cover the 1160 disease and injury sequelae. 27 Disability weights were generated from more than 30 000 respondents collected through population-based surveys in fi ve countries-USA, Peru, Tanzania, Bangladesh, and Indonesia-and an open internet survey. 271 respondents of the internet survey were from China. Uncertainty in the disability weight for each sequela has been propagated into the estimates of YLDs for each disease and injury. We combined information about age-specifi c mortality rates, and about overall age-specifi c YLDs per person into the overall measure of health expectancy, HALE, using a standard approach to extending the life table to capture adjustments for non-fatal health outcomes. 28\r\n Deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs attributable to 67 risk factors or clusters of risk factors were assessed with three key inputs. 23 First, for each risk-outcome pair, relative risks of mortality or morbidity, or both, were estimated on the basis of meta-analyses of the published literature. Second, each risk factor exposure distribution in each country, age, and sex group was estimated on the basis of published and unpublished data sources with mostly Bayesian estimation methods. 23 For China, key sources included the 2002 China National Nutrition and Health Survey, the China Global Youth Tobacco Survey, the Second National Health Services Survey, the 1996 Global Youth Tobacco Survey, the 1996 National Prevalence Survey, the After-MONICA, the INTERSALT Beijing, the INTERMAP Beijing, and the 2000 and 2005 national censuses. Third, we estimated attributable deaths or DALYs by comparing the present distribution of exposure to a theoretical minimum risk counterfactual distribution of exposure selected for each risk factor. Each risk factor or cluster of risk factors was analysed separately and therefore the sum of attributable fractions for a disease or injury can be greater than 100%. Uncertainty in the relative risks, exposure estimates, and theoretical minimum risk distributions and uncertainty in the background outcome rates have been propagated into the fi nal estimates.\r\n For outcomes measured for specifi c age groups (deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs), we directly computed age-standardised rates with the WHO age-standard. 54 factor, we ranked countries in 1990 and 2010 by the age-standardised rates for each outcome measure. We compared China outcomes to the 18 other countries that are members of the G20 (the 20th member is the European Union). The G20 is the set of developed and developing countries identifi ed as global agenda setters.\r\n Comparisons of China with this group provide insights into China's standing relative to this set of developed or rapidly developing countries. For each quantity of interest in the GBD, 1000 draws were taken from the posterior distribution. We computed ranks across causes and percentage change from 1990 to 2010 at the draw level. We report 95% uncertainty intervals for ranks. For percentage change from 1990 to 2010 com puted at the level of each draw, we report the median percentage change, which is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean percentage change. For a specifi c country and cause, we tested whether a country was signifi cantly greater than the G20 mean, indistin guish able from the mean, or below the mean.\r\n The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had fi nal respon sibility to submit for publication. Changes in age-specifi c mortality rates in China from 1990 to 2010 varied widely by age and sex (fi gure 1). Under-5 mortality rates declined by nearly 70% (95% UI 61\u00b73-77\u00b79). We noted declines in female adult mortality with declines in excess of 50% for age groups 0 years to 30-34 years. Progress in reduction of male mortality was substantially worse than that noted for women. Figure 1 shows comparative progress in reduction of age-specifi c mortality with other G20 countries. For men, China's In some cases, the 95% UI has an upper and lower bound equal to the rank of the mean death rate. Countries have been ranked such that the best performer is ranked as one for each indicator.

For women and girls, however, we noted a substantial relative improvement, with ranks improving from 16th to 10th in the age groups 15-19 years through to 50-54 years.\r\n Although we noted a relative improvement for women older than 60 years, the improvement was less pronounced. Table 2 shows the number of deaths and the age-standardised death rate for each cause in 1990 and 2010. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders have declined by 59\u00b75% (95% UI 54\u00b74-63\u00b78). Among these disorders, however, the large increase in HIV deaths is notable. The number of deaths from non-communicable disease rose from 5\u00b79 million (5\u00b77-6\u00b73) to 7\u00b70 million (6\u00b77-7\u00b73), but agestandardised death rates declined 27\u00b78% (24\u00b72-33\u00b71); \r\n Skin and subcutaneous diseases\r\n Abscess, impetigo, and other bacterial skin diseases\r\n Other skin and subcutaneous diseases\r\n Motorised vehicle with three or more wheels\r\n Fire, heat, and hot substances\r\n Assault by other means China has made substantial progress in reduction of the number of child deaths from 1\u00b70 million (95% UI 0\u00b79-1\u00b71 million) in 1990 to 213 0000 (179 600-260 700) in 2010 (table 3) . During this period, the main causes of child mortality also changed. The top fi ve specifi c causes, accounting for 59\u00b77% (51\u00b77-69\u00b71) of child deaths in 2010 were (in order of frequency) congenital anomalies, preterm birth complications, lower respiratory infections, neonatal encephalopathy, and drowning. Diarrhoeal diseases were ranked sixth (95% UI fi fth to seventh) in 1990 but accounted for 0\u00b79% (95% UI 0\u00b76-1\u00b73) of child deaths in 2010, and measles were ranked seventh (sixth to 13th) in 1990 but accounted for 0\u00b72% (95% UI <0\u00b705-0\u00b74) of child deaths in 2010. Figure 2 shows the striking transition in YLLs that took place in China between 1990 and 2010. The number of YLLs attributable to neonatal causes, diarrhoea, pneumonia, and other infectious causes and injuries in children declined profoundly in this period. At the same time, a shift occurred towards a large number of cardiovascular and cancer YLLs at older ages with a notable peak in cancer YLLs in the 55-59 year age group in 2010. The number, age pattern, and composition of injury YLLs also changed: we noted increases and shifts to older ages in transport injuries and large declines in intentional injuries. Figure 3 shows the transition in leading causes of YLLs from 1990 to 2010. We noted striking declines in major communicable and neonatal causes of premature mortality: lower respiratory infections moved from fi rst (95% UI fi rst to third) to ninth (eighth to 11th); neonatal encephalopathy dropped 14 ranks (sixth to 20th); preterm birth complications dropped ten ranks (ninth to 19th); a 77% (95% UI 72-84) decline in YLLs from tuberculosis led it to drop from 15th (13th to 16th) to 29th (26th to 35th); and diarrhoea and meningitis also had substantial improvements. YLLs from stroke, ischaemic heart disease, road injury, lung cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, and diabetes increased. Although population ageing was a key driver of these increases, age-standardised YLL rates (data not shown) for ischaemic heart disease, road injury, lung cancer, and diabetes also increased between 1990 and 2010. Several disorders that did not increase in incidence remained leading causes of YLLs in 2010: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stomach cancer, selfharm, oesophageal cancer, drowning, falls, and congenital anoma lies. The substantial decrease we noted in premature mortality from drowning deserves note. Incidence of HIV\/AIDS increased strikingly in the 20-year period to become the 23rd biggest cause (20th to 29th) of YLLs. Figure 4 shows the levels of premature mortality in China relative to other members of the G20 in 2010. For men in China in 2010, age-standardised rates of years of life lost due to ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, cirrhosis, diabetes, preterm birth complications, chronic kidney diseases, HIV\/AIDS, and tuberculosis were signifi cantly better than the G20 mean. China had signifi cantly worse ranks than the mean for stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver cancer, stomach cancer, oesophageal cancer, leukaemia, drowning, and falls. The YLL rates of road injury and lung cancer for 2010 are indistinguishable from the mean but the absolute increase in YLLs from these causes is concerning. For women in China, we noted better than G20 average performance on ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, diabetes, breast cancer, preterm birth complications, chronic kidney diseases, cervical cancer, cirrhosis, and cardiovascular and circulatory diseases. We noted worse than G20 average outcomes for stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, road injury, self-harm, liver cancer, stomach cancer, oesoph ageal cancer, falls, drowning, and rheumatic heart disease. Even for conditions such as ischaemic heart disease, lung cancer, and diabetes (for which China was better than average in the G20 in 2010), rising rates suggest that this status might change in the near future.\r\n Appendix p 6 shows YLDs per head by age in China, by sex, in 1990 and 2010. Compared with substantial declines in mortality, we noted relatively little change in the age-specifi c YLDs per head. The percentage of DALYs attributable to YLDs increased from 28\u00b71% (95% UI 24\u00b72-32\u00b75) to 39\u00b74% (34\u00b79-43\u00b78) in 2010. Figure 5 shows the prominent role played by mental and behavioural disorders (23\u00b76%, 18\u00b79-28\u00b76) and Ascending order in rank Descending order in rank musculoskeletal disorders (25\u00b78%, 21\u00b77-29\u00b79) as causes of YLDs in adults. At younger ages, however, nutritional defi ciencies, and some neglected tropical diseases make an important contribution. Other important causes included diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine causes; other non-communicable diseases, which includes vision loss, hearing loss, and skin diseases; and unintentional injuries, which includes falls. Although age-specifi c YLDs per head rise with age, the eff ect of population age-structure leads to 77\u00b72% (76\u00b75-78\u00b70) of YLDs occurring before age 60 years in China. Figure 6 compares the leading causes of YLDs in 1990 and 2010. The top 11 causes of YLDs all increased in terms of the absolute numbers of YLDs. Of the top ten causes of disability in 2010, four were musculoskeletal China ranked among the G20 as having the fi fth lowest age-standardised rate of major de pression. Diabetes, falls, chronic obstruc tive pulmonary disease, and hearing loss constituted the other top ten causes of YLDs. Progress on tackling com muni cable diseases was also evident in the analysis of YLDs. We noted substantial declines (>30\u00b70%) for iron-defi ciency anaemia, hookworm, tuberculosis, and ascariasis. Putting premature mortality and disability together in terms of DALYs provides an overall picture of the leading health problems in China. Table 4 shows the number and rate of DALYs in 1990 and 2010 and the percentage change between 1990 and 2010. The top ten causes have prominent roles for cardiovascular disorders (stroke and ischaemic heart disease) and cancers (lung and liver). Two disorders that largely cause disability, low back pain and major depression, are also leading causes of DALYs. Four other disorders make up the top ten: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, road injuries, and falls, which all make up an important component of premature mortality and disability.\r\n Appendix pp 7-8 ranks each country by the agestandardised DALY rate across the G20 for men and women in 2010. Men in China had higher than G20 average rates of DALYs caused by stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver cancer, stomach cancer, oesophageal cancer, and drowning. Chinese women had increased rates of DALYs caused by stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, road injury, self-harm, liver cancer, and stomach cancer. For some of the leading causes of disability, including low back pain and neck pain, China had rates that are indistinguishable from the G20 mean. Comparing 1990 (data not shown) with 2010, eight causes switched from signifi cantly better than average to indistinguishable from average: falls, congenital anomalies, neonatal encephalopathy, poison ings, rheumatic heart disease, hookworm, ascariasis, and cysticercosis. For ischaemic heart disease, road injury and lung cancer (for which China was below the G20 average in 2010), rising rates mean that this situation might soon change. \r\n HIV disease resulting in mycobacterial infection\r\n HIV disease resulting in other specifi ed or unspecifi ed diseases\r\n Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers 772\u00b79 (96\u00b78-1455\u00b71)\r\n Lower respiratory infections 25 300\u00b79 (20 527\u00b77-29 014\u00b78)\r\n Other lower respiratory infections 3444\u00b70 (2318\u00b76-5218\u00b70)\r\n Neglected tropical diseases and malaria 8656\u00b72 (5002\u00b70-16 670\u00b79)\r\n (Continues on next page) \r\n Other communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders \r\n Liver cancer secondary to hepatitis B 3944\u00b78 (3240\u00b78-4694\u00b73)\r\n Liver cancer secondary to hepatitis C 1094\u00b72 (907\u00b75-1303\u00b74)\r\n Liver cancer secondary to alcohol use\r\n Other liver cancer\r\n Trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers\r\n Colon and rectum cancers\r\n Cancer of other part of pharynx and oropharynx\r\n Gallbladder and biliary tract cancer Hodgkin's disease \r\n Interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis\r\n Other chronic respiratory diseases\r\n Cirrhosis of the liver secondary to hepatitis B\r\n Cirrhosis of the liver secondary to hepatitis C 1035\u00b77 (728\u00b71-1210\u00b73)\r\n Cirrhosis of the liver secondary to alcohol use\r\n Other cirrhosis of the liver\r\n Gastritis and duodenitis\r\n Paralytic ileus and intestinal obstruction without hernia Other digestive diseases\r\n Alzheimer's disease and other dementias 957\u00b73 (732\u00b76-1179\u00b78) \r\n Other mental and behavioural disorders\r\n Diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases\r\n Chronic kidney disease due to diabetes mellitus\r\n Urinary diseases and male infertility\r\n Tubulointerstitial nephritis, pyelonephritis, and urinary tract infections\r\n Haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias\r\n Other haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias\r\n Other endocrine, nutritional, blood, and immune disorders \r\n Cleft lip and cleft palate\r\n Other chromosomal abnormalities\r\n Skin and subcutaneous diseases 5604\u00b70 (3661\u00b72-8513\u00b79)\r\n Abscess, impetigo, and other bacterial skin diseases Other sense organ diseases 21\u00b74 (7\u00b73-50\u00b72) were low in fruits, high in sodium, or low in whole grains; all of which are problems with diet even in rural areas. The second leading risk factor was high blood pressure, which accounted for 12\u00b70% (10\u00b74-13\u00b75) of DALYs and 24\u00b76% (21\u00b79-27\u00b72) of deaths. The third major risk was tobacco, accounting for 9\u00b75% (7\u00b74-11\u00b74) of DALYs and 16\u00b74% (12\u00b78-19\u00b79) \r\n Adverse eff ects of medical treatment\r\n Assault by other means \r\n Between 1990 and 2010, the health profi le of China changed rapidly. Premature mortality in children declined by almost 80%. The contribution of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders to DALYs declined for all ages from nearly 27% in 1990 to about 10% in 2010. The burden of disease is now dominated by cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, road injuries, and key causes of chronic disabilities such as mental and musculoskeletal disorders. Although the burden of suicide, drowning, and many injuries declined, the burden of road injuries and falls is increasing. The rise of non-communicable diseases and chronic disability is fuelled by a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children toward those for non-communicable diseases in adults. The one child policy in China implies the demographic shifts contributing to this rapid transition in health problems will intensify in the coming decades. China has had remarkable success in decreasing death rates and disability from communicable diseases. Deaths from diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections in children younger than 5 years declined by 90% in the two decades from 1990. DALYs caused by tuberculosis dropped by about 71%. We also noted large declines for incidence of infection with intestinal nematodes, meningitis, tetanus, measles, and diarrhoea. The speed of some of these declines provides a model for other developing countries. Communicable disease-control challenges, however, are not over. The burden of HIV increased between 1990 and 2010 (table 2) . 213 000 (95% UI 179 600-260 700) children younger than 5 years died in 2010, almost 60% of them from communicable, neonatal, and nutritional causes. Subnational assess ments would probably reveal that the burden of communicable diseases is high in some poor provinces. China faces challenges dealing with the ongoing risk of pandemic infl uenza. The 2013 outbreak of H7N9 shows how the interaction between animal and human populations continues to lead to new epidemics. Through the internet-based surveillance system run by the Chinese CDC, early detection of the fi rst human cases of H7N9 led to a coherent response. Despite progress, continued attention to the unfi nished agenda for communicable disease control is required and ongoing epidemic surveillance and response is a necessity.\r\n The burden of diseases attributable to individual behaviours and practices is steadily rising. The most important behaviours included diets low in fruit, high in sodium and low in whole grains, smoking, alcohol, and physical inactivity. Smoking prevalence in China for men is 52\u00b79% (one of the highest rates in the world) and for women is 2\u00b74% (one of the lowest), 55 and second-hand smoke exposure is as high as 72\u00b74%. 23, 56 The fraction of deaths attributable to tobacco increased from 12\u00b78% (9\u00b79-16\u00b79) in 1990 to 16\u00b74% (12\u00b78-19\u00b79) in 2010 (appendix p 10) and will increase because of the lag between consumption and death rates. The aggregation of 14 components of diet was the leading risk factor for DALYs in China, including the consumption of sodium and inadequate intake of fruit, whole grains, and nuts and seeds. Reliable data from the national nutrition surveys show that even rural Chinese diets dominated by rice are low in fruit, high in sodium, low in whole grains, and low in nuts and seeds. Rising incomes and a larger fraction of the population living to older ages mean that the burden attributable to these behaviours will increase. The extraordinary pace of urbanisation in China might exacerbate this trans formation. The urban population in China has more than tripled in the past 30 years and the rate of urbanisation is accelerating. 57, 58 Although urbanisation off ers opportunities for improvements in population health in China (such as access to improved health care and basic infrastructure), it also can lead to substantial health risks including ambient air pollution, occupational and traffi c hazards, and poor diet and little physical activity. Associated social and economic challenges will accompany these shifts. For example, the ratio of the population older than 65 years to the workingaged population (aged 20-64 years) was 0\u00b7127 in 2010 and is expected to rise to 0\u00b7184 in 2020 and 0\u00b726 in 2030. 2 The physical environment is an important driver of health in China. High levels of PM2\u00b75, particularly in eastern China, have made ambient air pollution the fourth leading risk factor for DALYs. 59 Use of solid fuels-in particular coal in inadequately ventilated homes-also contributes to excess mortality. 59 Policies to change the physical layout of the road system and vehicle safety equipment might need to be enacted to restrict the burden of road injuries. 59 Physical activity might also be infl uenced by urban layout. Actions to address the physical environment, however, are far beyond the scope of the National Health and Family Planning Commission. Addressing these new and substantial risks to Chinese health will require multisectorial action at national, provincial, and local levels. Such action will need careful documentation of the health harms at a local level and the potential for aff ordable alternative policies to reduce these harms.\r\n Rapid reductions in fertility and age-specifi c mortality rates have led to many more Chinese individuals living to an old age, when rates of chronic disability are high. Incidence of health loss and health-care costs from mental disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and vision and hearing loss will steadily rise. China needs to plan for how the health system can prevent and manage these disorders cost-eff ectively. Along with Japan, South Korea, and Mexico, China seems to benefi t from lower rates of major depression, anxiety disorders, and low back pain than do other members of the G20. This fi nding, however, has been challenged; true rates might be higher. 36 Our fi ndings on these rates are based on the careful assessment of all the available evidence; resolution will require more in-depth research on the potential for reporting biases in China and other countries in east Asia. The rise of chronic disability also has implications for the types of health workers China will need in the next 10-20 years; disciplines such as psychiatry, rheuma tology, rehabilitation medicine, audiology, and ophthal mology might need increased investment. The recent adoption of China's fi rst mental health law is a positive development in this area. The key obstacle China confronts in strengthening its public health and primary health care is a shortage of human resources. Although the Chinese Government has identifi ed the training of family doctors as a top priority 60 (and plans to train 300 000 of them in the next 10 years), these targets seem challenging to reach. Retention of qualifi ed health professionals in rural areas, especially in poor regions, has been diffi cult.\r\n Compared with many countries, China is relatively unique in having fi ve cancers in the top 15 causes of premature mortality (Mexico, for example, has none): lung, liver, stomach, oesophageal, and colorectal. Of these cancers, the burden of lung, liver, and colorectal cancers increased between 1990 and 2010. China also has worse than G20 average rates for these cancers and oesophageal cancer. What are the policy options for China to address this unusually high burden of selected cancers? Tobacco and diet can account for important shares of stomach, colorectal, and lung cancers. Aggressive tobacco control and national eff orts to encourage changes in diet will be important. Hepatitis B is related to 54\u00b72% (95% UI 49\u00b75-58\u00b78) of the increasing burden of liver cancer; immunisation programmes will lead eventually to reductions but, because the median age of liver cancer burden is 55 years, several decades will need to pass before the eff ect of vaccination can substantially reduce the burden of this cancer. Benefi ts from screening and treatment for colorectal cancer 61 should be assessed as to whether they are cost eff ective for China. Access to improved screening and treatment might also lead to improved outcomes for other cancers such as breast and cervical cancers.\r\n Stroke and ischaemic heart disease accounted for 15\u00b72% (13\u00b73-16\u00b76) of DALYs in 2010. DALY rates from stroke are nearly twice as high as ischaemic heart disease. Age-standardised rates for ischaemic heart disease increased between 1990 and 2010, although stroke rates in China were relatively constant. Increased blood pressure is the second leading risk factor in China ahead of tobacco consumption. Increased fasting plasma glucose and total cholesterol are also important risks of DALYs. Public health programmes to reduce tobacco consumption, sodium intake, and change other dietary risks are clearly important strategies for tackling of cardiovascular diseases in China. Primary care can also be a platform for delivery of interventions such as the detection and pharmacological management of raised blood pressure and cholesterol, and screening and management of diabetes, and impaired glucose tolerance. Because of China's hospital-centred health system, strengthening primary care to handle these and other problems will require a shift in policy focus. The massive declines in rates of death from ischaemic heart disease in many high-income countries have also been attributable to improved management of acute cardiac events and post-event care. [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] China increasingly needs to provide access to high-quality medical services in communities with rising rates of cardiovascular diseases.\r\n The Chinese Government needs to take responsibility for expansion of prevention strategies for behavioural risks; even small reductions in these risks could generate substantial health benefi ts. Subsidies, taxation, regulation, and information campaigns need to be prioritised to reduce tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke, increase consumption of fruits, whole grain, nuts, and seeds, reduce salt intake, increase physical activity, and reduce alcohol consumption. Eff ective policies will need to be multisectorial, engaging other sectors such as employment, income maintenance, social welfare, housing, education, and the mass media. To engender multisectorial action, the Chinese Government needs to defi ne the goals and indicators for health development, monitor key health risk factors, select intervention strategies, and track policy implementation at a national level. This strategy will not only improve the levels of health status of the population, but contribute to sustainable development of the Chinese economy and society.\r\n This analysis of the burden of disease in China has several important limitations. The results have the same limitations as GBD 2010. 1, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] In GBD 2010, no data existed for some of the 1160 disabling sequelae for some or even many of the countries. Results have been informed by several data sources available for China but for some disorders the data are weak or absent (eg, autism, cannabis dependence, endometriosis, and genital prolapse). In other cases, substantial diff erences exist between the available data sources (eg, for some cancers the cause of death data and population-based cancer registry data are inconsistent in some age groups). The reporting of UIs provides the reader with some information on the extent of the information available for China. Uncertainty could, for various reasons such as unrecognised bias in published studies, still be under estimated. The analysis of risk factors has focused on proximal and behavioural risks. The important role of social determinants 67 was not quantifi ed in the GBD 2010 because of a dearth of available data and suffi cient evidence. The assessment of YLDs depends crucially on the validity of the disability weights measured by Salomon and colleagues. 27 Although investigation across several countries reported no evidence of systematic diff er ences; disability weights obtained in a national survey in China could be diff erent from other countries. 68, 69 Most importantly, a national analysis for a country as large and diverse as China could mask substantial variations in key outcomes. For example, the HIV epidemic is very concentrated in some provinces. 70, 71 The rapid transition towards non-communicable diseases and disability is probably more advanced in eastern provinces. In view of improvements in some data systems in the previous decade, the possibility of bias exists in the measurement of some diseases overtime. We believe that the substantial eff orts to correct for these biases that are part of the GBD method minimises this possibility.\r\n In view of the pace of health change in China, the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors should be monitored every year. Annual assessments along with subnational detail at the provincial level ought to be undertaken. Key developments in the health infor mation system that are underway will facilitate such an analysis. Development of a complete national vital events registration system with certifi cation of cause of death would strikingly aid in this endeavour. In the previous 2 years alone, a rapid expansion has occurred in coverage of cause of death certifi cation so that more than half of all deaths were captured in 2012. The national internet case reporting system can provide local level detail on 39 diseases since 2004. Several national surveys are underway or planned with large sample sizes. Ensuring that the various surveillance systems and topic-specifi c national surveys ultimately combine to provide a coherent picture of the prevalence of major diseases, injuries, and risk factors at the provincial level will also reduce the role of statistical estimation in generating burden of disease results. Robust annual assessments of the burden will provide China with a powerful method to benchmark progress against developed and other rapidly developing nations and assess where investments and policy action have been eff ective. Setting priorities for the health system, however, will also need information on the costs and consequences of diff erent policy options, a better under standing of health inequalities and the capacity of the health system to implement change that is both effi cient and fair.\r\n GY wrote the fi rst draft of the report.

Health system reforms focused on delivering improved access to quality clinical care 14 are now underway but can be better informed by a broad assessment of China's progress in health. In this report, we use the results of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) to examine in detail the transformation of health in China from 1990 to 2010 and to benchmark health challenges in China to 18 major high-income and rapidly developing countries that are members of the G20. For each of these causes, up to 24 sequelae exist that are clinical outcomes related to specifi c diseases and injuries, such as neuropathy due to diabetes. Disability weights are based on surveys of the general population. 24 The appendix p 11 provides a listing of the major sources of information used to assess causes of death in China since 1980, including population-based cancer registry data. We assessed the quality of each data source, and mapped the codes for various Chinese variants of the International Classifi cation of Diseases and Injuries (ICD) tabulation lists to the GBD 2010 cause list. We reassigned deaths assigned to ill-defi ned diagnoses or to disorders that are not likely to be underlying causes of death with standard algorithms. 30, 31 GBD 2010 provides the most comprehensive eff ort to date to enhance the comparability of cause of death data across countries because it adjusts for revisions of the ICD and the redistribution of garbage codes. Garbage codes are causes of death that should not be identifi ed as underlying causes of death but have been entered as the underlying cause of death on death certifi cates. Classic examples of garbage codes include senility or cardiopulmonary arrest. 27 Disability weights were generated from more than 30 000 respondents collected through population-based surveys in fi ve countries-USA, Peru, Tanzania, Bangladesh, and Indonesia-and an open internet survey. Uncertainty in the disability weight for each sequela has been propagated into the estimates of YLDs for each disease and injury. We combined information about age-specifi c mortality rates, and about overall age-specifi c YLDs per person into the overall measure of health expectancy, HALE, using a standard approach to extending the life table to capture adjustments for non-fatal health outcomes. Comparisons of China with this group provide insights into China's standing relative to this set of developed or rapidly developing countries. We report 95% uncertainty intervals for ranks. The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had fi nal respon sibility to submit for publication. Under-5 mortality rates declined by nearly 70% (95% UI 61\u00b73-77\u00b79). We noted declines in female adult mortality with declines in excess of 50% for age groups 0 years to 30-34 years. Progress in reduction of male mortality was substantially worse than that noted for women. Countries have been ranked such that the best performer is ranked as one for each indicator. The number of deaths from non-communicable disease rose from 5\u00b79 million (5\u00b77-6\u00b73) to 7\u00b70 million (6\u00b77-7\u00b73), but agestandardised death rates declined 27\u00b78% (24\u00b72-33\u00b71); \r\n Skin and subcutaneous diseases\r\n Abscess, impetigo, and other bacterial skin diseases\r\n Other skin and subcutaneous diseases\r\n Motorised vehicle with three or more wheels\r\n Fire, heat, and hot substances\r\n Assault by other means China has made substantial progress in reduction of the number of child deaths from 1\u00b70 million (95% UI 0\u00b79-1\u00b71 million) in 1990 to 213 0000 (179 600-260 700) in 2010 (table 3) . The number of YLLs attributable to neonatal causes, diarrhoea, pneumonia, and other infectious causes and injuries in children declined profoundly in this period. Figure 4 shows the levels of premature mortality in China relative to other members of the G20 in 2010. China had signifi cantly worse ranks than the mean for stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver cancer, stomach cancer, oesophageal cancer, leukaemia, drowning, and falls. Even for conditions such as ischaemic heart disease, lung cancer, and diabetes (for which China was better than average in the G20 in 2010), rising rates suggest that this status might change in the near future. Although age-specifi c YLDs per head rise with age, the eff ect of population age-structure leads to 77\u00b72% (76\u00b75-78\u00b70) of YLDs occurring before age 60 years in China. Figure 6 compares the leading causes of YLDs in 1990 and 2010. Two disorders that largely cause disability, low back pain and major depression, are also leading causes of DALYs. Men in China had higher than G20 average rates of DALYs caused by stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver cancer, stomach cancer, oesophageal cancer, and drowning. The second leading risk factor was high blood pressure, which accounted for 12\u00b70% (10\u00b74-13\u00b75) of DALYs and 24\u00b76% (21\u00b79-27\u00b72) of deaths. Premature mortality in children declined by almost 80%. The one child policy in China implies the demographic shifts contributing to this rapid transition in health problems will intensify in the coming decades. China has had remarkable success in decreasing death rates and disability from communicable diseases. Deaths from diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections in children younger than 5 years declined by 90% in the two decades from 1990. 213 000 (95% UI 179 600-260 700) children younger than 5 years died in 2010, almost 60% of them from communicable, neonatal, and nutritional causes.

Recently, it has been shown that IL-17-producing T cells belong to a unique subset of T cells, T H 17 cells, that develop under the control of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and IL-6 in mice and IL-23 and IL-1\u03b2 in humans via the transcription factor . IL-17A and IL-17F are important molecules in neutrophil recruitment and granulopoiesis 2 . IL-23 has also been shown to be crucial as an upstream regulator of IL-17 production in vivo 11, 12 . Mice with a homozygous deletion of the gene encoding IL-17 receptor A (Il17ra), which can bind both IL-17A and IL-17F ( ref. 13 ), are susceptible to lung infection with the Gramnegative bacteria K. pneumoniae. These mice do not mount a normal mucosal granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) response, which leads to defective granulopoiesis in response to the infection 14 . Antibodies to IL-17A have also been shown to impair intraabdominal abscess formation in response to Bacteroides fragilis 15 and host defense against Bordetella pertussis 16 and Mycoplasma pulmonis 17 .\r\n IL-22 is an IL-10 family cytokine member 18 that was originally thought to be predominantly expressed in T H 1 cells and has been shown to induce the antimicrobial peptides human \u03b2defensin 2 and \u03b2-defensin 3; with IL-17A, IL-22 augments expression of the calciumbinding proteins S100A7, S100A8 and S100A9 in skin keratinocytes 19, 20 . It has recently been shown that T H 17 cells grown in vitro also produce IL-22, and in vitro production was optimized when IL-23 was present 20 .\r\n On the basis of this evidence, we hypothesized that IL-22 may be a crucial effector molecule in host defense against Gram-negative bacterial infection in the lung. Here we show that human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells express IL-22R and that IL-22 and IL-17 induce host defense genes, as well as increase the clonogenic potential of HBE cells. Using an experimental model of Gram-negative pneumonia, we show that IL-22 is produced in a time-dependent fashion, similarly to IL-17A and IL-17F ( ref. 12 ), and is regulated by IL-23. Neutralization of IL-22 resulted in a marked bacterial dissemination from the lung that was exacerbated by the absence of IL-17A. IL-22 also increased the expression of host defense genes in mouse lung epithelium and, among these, lipocalin-2 was required for IL-22augmented epithelial antimicrobial activity in vitro. These data demonstrate that IL-22 has a crucial role in mucosal host defense, and they support the concept that the T H 17 cell lineage and the effector molecules produced by these cells evolved to effect host defense against extracellular pathogens at mucosal sites.\r\n The production of IL-17A and IL-17F in infected tissue is regulated by IL-23 ( ref. 12 ); however, IL-23 has been shown to be only marginally involved in primary infections with pathogens that require T H 1 immunity, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis 21 . Similar to mice deficient in IL-23 (Il23a \u2212\/\u2212 ), mice deficient in IL-17RA, which is required for IL-17A and IL-17F signaling 13 , are not more susceptible to H37Rv M. tuberculosis infection than wild-type mice ( Supplementary Fig. 1 online) . Moreover, IL-17RA signaling is not required for host defense against another T H 1-dependent pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes ( Supplementary Fig. 2 online), and these mice have normal interferon-\u03b3 responses upon antigen recall to the pathogen ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). This is consistent with normal T H 1 immunity and host resistance against L. monocytogenes in Il22 \u2212\/\u2212 mice 22 . These data suggest that T H 17 cells may be important for host defense against extracellular pathogens because they produce IL-17A and IL-22.\r\n IL-22R is expressed on polarized, ciliated, primary HBE cells (Fig. 1a) , and its expression at the mRNA level is not altered after 24-h stimulation with IL-17A, IL-22 or both cytokines  (Supplementary Fig. 3a online). To examine gene expression, we stimulated HBE cells with  10 ng\/ml IL-17A, 20 ng\/ml IL-22 or a combination of both for 24 h and harvested total RNA  for microarray analysis. The combination of IL-22 with IL-17A markedly induced several host defense genes, including those encoding human \u03b2-defensin 2 (DEFB4), psoriasin (S100A7) and calgranulin C (S100A12), as well as IL19, CSF3, IL1F9, DUOX2, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL9 and CCL3 (Fig. 1b) . We confirmed CSF3 induction both at the mRNA level by real-time PCR (Supplementary Fig. 3b) and at the protein level (Fig. 1c) . Moreover, we observed a significant increase in IL-17A-induced IL-6 production in HBE cells by IL-22 (Fig. 1d) .\r\n As IL-22 has been implicated in wound repair in the skin 5 , we examined whether IL-22 increases the clonogenic frequency of HBE cells and whether IL-22 affects epithelial barrier function. Treatment with IL-22 at a concentration of 200 ng\/ml (but not 20 ng\/ml, data not shown) significantly increased the clonogenic potential of HBE cells compared to treatment with media alone, or compared to treatment with 100 ng\/ml of IL-17A (Fig. 1e) . We next evaluated whether IL-22 affected the maintenance of transepithelial resistance in injured epithelium. We created a 10-\u03bcM wound in well-differentiated, polarized HBE cells and found that the addition of IL-22 at a dose as low as 20 ng\/ml significantly enhanced recovery of epithelial resistance (Fig. 1f ). The recovery of resistance occurred as early as 6 h after the injury, whereas control cells recovered over a 36-h time period. IL-17A at doses of 10 or 100 ng\/ml had no activity in this assay (data not shown).\r\n To examine whether IL-22 is important for mucosal host defense in the lung, we used a well-established model of K. pneumoniae pulmonary infection. Similar to the previously observed time course for IL-17A and IL-17F production ( ref. 12 ), IL-22 was detectable at the message level as early as 6 h (Fig. 2a) and at the protein level in lung homogenate as early as 16 h in mice infected with K. pneumoniae (Fig. 2b) , and its expression was significantly elevated (P < 0.05) compared to that in uninfected mice. Additionally, it has been reported that T H 17 cells express CCR4 and CCR6 ( ref. 23 ), and thus we assessed the expression of the genes encoding the ligands for these receptors, Ccl17, Ccl20 and Ccl22. Both Ccl17 and Ccl20 expression was significantly increased (P < 0.05) at 4 h in lung tissue of mice infected with K. pneumoniae ( Supplementary Fig. 4 online), and Ccl20 expression continued to increase at 16 h. Ccl22 expression, however, showed a steady decline in this model ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ).\r\n We then investigated the potential cellular sources of IL-22 in our model system. Rag2 \u2212\/\u2212 Il2rg \u2212\/\u2212 mice (deficient in natural killer, T and B cells) were infected with K. pneumoniae, and their lungs were harvested at 24 h after infection ( Supplementary Fig. 5a online). As expected, Rag2 \u2212\/\u2212 Il2rg \u2212\/\u2212 mice produced no detectable IL-22 compared to their infected, wild-type (WT) counterparts. To further confirm that T cells produce IL-22 in response to K. pneumoniae, we isolated CD90 + T cells from lungs harvested from infected mice and uninfected controls and then assessed IL-22 precursor frequency by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT). There was a significant increase in IL-22-producing CD90 + cells in K. pneumoniae-infected mice compared to uninfected controls ( Supplementary Fig. 5b ). There were no spots from CD90 \u2212 cells (data not shown).\r\n We next determined the survival of WT and Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice treated with control antibody or antibody to IL-22 and challenged with 1 \u00d7 10 4 colony-forming units (CFU) of K. pneumoniae (Fig. 2c ). Compared to WT mice or Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice given control antibody, WT mice treated with antibody to IL-22 were moribund 24 h after infection and had to be killed. Mice treated with antibody to IL-22 had significantly (P < 0.05) greater numbers of CFU in the lung compared to control mice (Fig. 2d) and also showed increased dissemination to the spleen (Fig. 2e) . Administration of antibodies to IL-22 did not affect induction of IL-17A in this model ( Supplementary Fig. 6 online). Consistent with a more crucial role for IL-22 than for IL-17A in mucosal host defense, increased dissemination to the spleen was not detectable in Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice until 48 h after infection (Fig. 2f) . Moreover, administration of IL-22-specific antibody to Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice before infection with K. pneumoniae resulted in significantly greater bacterial growth in the lung (Fig. 2g) and significantly more bacterial dissemination to the spleen (Fig. 2h ) at 24 h after infection. To exclude the possibility of IL-17F compensation in Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice, we also assessed IL-17F levels in WT and Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice, and, at 18 h after infection, IL-17F was similarly induced in both strains of mice (data not shown).\r\n Similarly to Il17ra \u2212\/\u2212 ( ref. 14 ) and Il23a \u2212\/\u2212 ( ref. 12 ) mice, Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice had significantly lower amounts of G-CSF and CXCL1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid at 24 h compared to WT mice ( Fig. 3a,b) . However, compared to WT mice, mice treated with antibody to IL-22 showed no difference in BAL G-CSF and CXCL1 protein concentrations ( Fig. 3a,b) . Despite the lack of a function for IL-22 in regulation of G-CSF and CXCL1 in WT mice, Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice given antibody to IL-22 had lower Csf3 abundance compared to Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice given control antibody, but this difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, CXCL1 expression was partially dependent on both IL-17A and IL-22, as it was lower in Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice treated with antibody to IL-22 (Fig. 3b) . In contrast to G-CSF, IL-22 was crucial for IL-6 production in the lung, as both antibody to IL-22-treated WT and Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice had statistically significant reductions in BAL IL-6 abundance 24 h after infection (Fig. 3c) . A similar pattern was also observed with CCL3 (Fig. 3d) , where mice treated with antibody to IL-22 had significantly lower CCL3 in the BAL fluid at 24 h after infection compared to control mice. In the absence of IL-17A, antibody neutralization of IL-22 resulted in a further reduction in IL-6 and CCL3 abundance, suggesting a requirement for both IL-17A and IL-22 in this response.\r\n IL-23 is a key factor for the survival of T H 17 cells, and thus we investigated whether IL-23 is required for IL-22 elaboration in vivo. The induction of IL-22 mRNA requires IL-23, as IL-22 expression was markedly attenuated in Il23a \u2212\/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4a) . We next examined whether administration of recombinant IL-22, IL-17A or both intratracheally 12 h after infection with 1 \u00d7 10 3 CFU of K. pneumoniae could augment mucosal host defense. Even at this lower bacterial inoculum, as previously reported, Il23a \u2212\/\u2212 mice treated with vehicle had higher organism burdens in the lung compared to WT mice (Fig. 4b) . Treatment with recombinant IL-22, IL-17A or both significantly reduced recoverable CFU in the lung at 24 h (Fig. 4b) . Furthermore, there was significantly less bacterial dissemination to the spleen in mice given recombinant IL-22, IL-17A or both cytokines (Fig. 4c) .\r\n As IL-22R is expressed in epithelial cells, we tested whether this is the site of action of recombinant IL-22 in the lung using in situ hybridization for Cxcl1 and the closely related Cxcl2 and Cxcl9 (Fig. 5) , as these genes have been shown to be regulated by IL-17A in vivo in pulmonary infection 14, 24 . WT mice showed Cxcl9 transcripts in both airway cells and alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 5) . Il23a \u2212\/\u2212 mice showed less staining in lung tissue (Fig. 5) ; however, administration of IL-22, IL-17A or the combination of IL-22 with IL-17A augmented hybridization signals for Cxcl1, Cxcl2 and Cxcl9 expression (Fig. 5) . Moreover, IL-22 treatment resulted in increased transcripts for Cxcl1, Cxcl2 and Cxcl9 in bronchiole epithelium (Fig. 5, black arrows) , whereas administration of IL-17A or the combination of IL-22 and IL-17A increased expression in bronchiole epithelium as well as in distal lung epithelium (Fig. 5, gray arrows) .\r\n To investigate the gene expression and antimicrobial activity of IL-22 in mouse lung epithelium, we studied polarized primary mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTECs). Cells were stimulated with 20 ng\/ml IL-22 and 10 ng\/ml IL-17, and Csf3 protein abundance was significantly (P < 0.05) increased by the combination of IL-22 and IL-17 (Fig. 6a) . This was also the case with Cxcl1 (Fig. 6b) . To analyze gene expression in these cells, we performed microarray analysis. There was upregulation of several host defense genes, including Lcn2 (encoding lipocalin-2), Cxcl1, Cxcl5, Pigr (encoding the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor) and Cxcl9 (Fig. 6c) . Lipocalin-2 is a protein known to have a function in innate immune response through its ability to sequester iron from bacterial organisms such as Escherichia coli 25, 26 .\r\n To investigate whether IL-22 has an antimicrobial function in vitro, we applied K. pneumoniae apically to MTECs that had been pretreated with IL-22, IL-17A or both cytokines. IL-22 significantly (P < 0.05) augmented killing of K. pneumoniae (Fig. 6d) . This was dependent on the expression of lipocalin-2 as IL-22-induced killing was significantly abrogated in MTEC cultures derived from Lcn2 \u2212\/\u2212 mice compared to WT controls (Fig. 6d ).\r\n Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia is common in immunocompromised individuals such as organ transplant recipients 27 . In order to study IL-22 in this cohort, we obtained samples of BAL fluid from seven subjects who were lung transplant recipients with bacterial pneumonia. Although most subjects had elevated CXCL8 levels (a measure of sample integrity), none had any significant detectable levels of IL-22 or IL-17A (Supplementary Table 1 online). This was not surprising to us in light of the fact that all individuals were maintained on T cell immunosuppression to prevent rejection of their transplanted lungs. These data are in contrast to the elevated sputum IL-17A and IL-17F levels observed during Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in subjects with cystic fibrosis who have normal T cell function 28 . On the basis of these observations, we investigated IL-22 expression during this gram-negative bacterial lung infection.\r\n We studied banked BAL fluid samples from individuals with cystic fibrosis undergoing a clinical exacerbation with P. aeruginosa infection and from control individuals without cystic fibrosis. Compared to the controls, IL-23, IL-17A and IL-17F were significantly elevated in BAL fluid of subjects with cystic fibrosis (Fig. 6e) . Of note, very little IL-22 was detected in these samples (Fig. 6e) . Based on the fact that in our mouse pneumonia model, IL-22 levels were higher in lung tissue than in BAL, we sought to determine whether IL-22 responses were elevated in lung lymphoid tissue in humans. We isolated cells from explanted hilar lymph nodes from individuals with end-stage cystic fibrosis undergoing lung transplantation (n = 5), in addition to uninfected control lung lymph nodes from individuals without cystic fibrosis (n = 2). Compared to uninfected lung lymph nodes from individuals without cystic fibrosis, dissociated lymph nodes cells from P. aeruginosa-infected subjects with cystic fibrosis had significantly increased spontaneous production of IL-17A (Fig. 6f) , IL-17F and IL-22 (Fig. 6g) , and production of these cytokines were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA), a glycoprotein that stimulates T lymphocyte proliferation (Fig.  6f,g) .\r\n These data demonstrate that IL-22 has a more crucial role than IL-17A in mucosal host defense and in our model of experimental bacterial pneumonia. IL-22 expression in vivo is regulated by IL-23, and rescue of Il23a \u2212\/\u2212 mice is associated with increased lung epithelial expression of CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL9. Similar to the situation in Il17ra \u2212\/\u2212 mice, IL-17A was crucial for the induction of G-CSF, a key regulator of granulopoiesis in response to an infectious challenge 14 , in the lung. However, IL-22 was more important than IL-17A in regulating pulmonary IL-6 and CCL3 production. Studies in Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice show that IL-6 and CCL3 are coordinately regulated by both T H 17 effectors, suggesting that the synergy observed with IL-17A and IL-22 in human bronchial epithelial cells in terms of gene expression is relevant in the in vivo setting as well. Additional activities of IL-22 not shared by IL-17A were the effect of increasing clonogenic frequencies of HBE cells, as well enhancing repair of transepithelial resistance. These activities of IL-22 may be crucial for maintaining barrier function at epithelial surfaces. In support of this, WT and Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice that received antibody to IL-22 had more rapid bacterial dissemination outside of the lung compared with mice given control antibody. In vitro MTEC studies show that a key gene regulated by IL-22 in the epithelium is lipocalin-2, which is required for epithelial host defense against K. pneumoniae in vitro. This is consistent with the fact that Lcn2 \u2212\/\u2212 mice are susceptible to certain Gram-negative bacteria, depending upon which siderophores they express 25, 26 .\r\n Furthermore, we show that IL-17R signaling is dispensable for host defense to a primary challenge with M. tuberculosis or L. monocytogenes, two intracellular pathogens that require T H 1 immunity. These data strongly suggest that the T H 17 lineage evolved to mediate host defense at mucosal and serosal surfaces against extracellular pathogens. Additionally, neutralization of IL-17A has been shown to abrogate host defense against lung pathogens, such as K. pneumoniae and M. pulmonis 14, 17 , systemic infection with the fungus Candida albicans 29 , as well as in the setting of intra-abdominal infection, B. fragilis 15 and E. coli 30 . Potential host defense mechanisms downstream from IL-22 and IL-17A, in addition to granulopoiesis, are the regulation of chemokine gradients and the mucosal production of antimicrobial proteins such as \u03b2-defensins 31 and calgranulins 20 . It is noteworthy that IL-22 responses are significantly elevated in lung lymphoid tissue from human subjects with cystic fibrosis. This is consistent with elevated levels of antimicrobial peptides in the sputum and BAL of these individuals 32 and may explain in part why bacteremia with P. aeruginosa is rare in these individuals.\r\n Although neither IL-23 nor IL-17R signaling is required for host defense against primary infection with M. tuberculosis, vaccine-induced protection with the BCG tuberculosis vaccine requires the local recruitment of IL-17A-producing T cells 24 . In this study, IL-17A regulated the expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10, thereby regulating T H 1 cell recruitment 24 . It has recently been shown that IL-17A is also required for vaccine-induced immunity against S. pneumoniae 33 and B. pertussis 16 . The vaccine-induced immunity observed in S. pneumoniae infection was independent of antibody production 33 , suggesting that T H 17 cells may regulate mucosal immunity apart from humoral immune responses. Thus, adjuvants that are capable of regulating IL-22 or IL-17A production may serve as robust adjuvants where one desires strong mucosal immunity. A caveat of this approach is the fact that T H 17 cells are also important in autoimmunity 1, 34 . Recently, it has been shown that IL-27 is a key negative regulator of T H 17 immunity 35, 36 and may be crucial for limiting T H 17-induced pathology in the setting of infection. In summary, both IL-22 and IL-17A have independent roles in maintaining host defense against K. pneumoniae, and these results raise the possibility for new therapies to use these cytokines to limit or prevent mucosal infections.\r\n Primary HBE cells were provided by the Tissue Core Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh or purchased from Cambrex (Lonza). We grew primary cells as polarized airliquid interface (ALI) cultures as previously described 28 . We stimulated HBE cells apically and basolaterally for 24 h with media (control), recombinant human IL-22, IL-17A (both R&D Systems) or both cytokines.\r\n We cultured MTECs as described by You et al. 37 . We stimulated cells growing at the ALI with IL-22 and IL-17A. We pretreated cells harvested from Lcn2 \u2212\/\u2212 mice similarly and infected them with 1 \u00d7 10 4 CFU of K. pneumoniae apically for 8 h.\r\n We stained HBE cells with polyclonal goat antibody to human IL-22R (Novus Biologicals) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey antibody to goat IgG (Molecular Probes) and then detected stained cells with the FACSAria flow cytometer.\r\n To determine clonogenic frequency, we performed a limiting-dilution assay as previously described 38 . We sorted primary HBE cells with a FACSAria flow cytometer directly into media (control), IL-22 or IL-17A (R&D Systems). After 72 h, we fixed the cells and stained them with 0.5% crystal violet.\r\n We created 10-\u03bcm wounds in HBE cells with a pipette tip. We measured transepithelial resistance over 36 h. We then treated the cells with media, IL-22 or IL-17A.\r\n We isolated total RNA from cultured cells and lung homogenate and used the real-time PCR detection system iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad) to detect the genes of interest. We purchased genespecific primers and probes for IL-22, IL-22R, G-CSF, CCL17, CCL20 and CCL22, as well as CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL9, from Applied Biosystems. Data are expressed using the C T method and normalized to the housekeeping gene Rn18s (18s rRNA).\r\n Microarray was performed using the human 133A 2.0 and mouse 430 2.0 gene chip platforms (Affymetrix) by the University of Pittsburgh Genomics and Proteomics Core Laboratory.

Common gamma (\u03b3c) Rag2 \u2212\/\u2212 mice and their age-matched C57BL\/10ScNCR controls were obtained from Taconic. Mice were housed in specific pathogen-free rooms within animal care facilities of the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. All mouse experiments were approved by the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh Animal Research and Care Committee.\r\n We anesthetized mice using the isofluorane inhalation method (IsoFlo, Abbott Laboratories) and gave them 50 \u03bcl of K. pneumoniae strain 43816 serotype 2 via retropharyngeal instillation at an inoculum of 1 \u00d7 10 4 CFU\/ml. We dissected the spleen and whole lung from the mice and homogenized them in PBS for CFU plating. For studies involving IL-22 neutralization, we gave WT or Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice either control antibody (goat IgG) or 50 \u03bcg of goat antibody to mouse IL-22 (R&D Systems) intratracheally immediately before infection with K. pneumoniae. For IL-22 and IL-17A rescue experiments, we gave Il23a \u2212\/\u2212 mice vehicle (PBS) or 1 \u03bcg of mouse recombinant IL-22, IL-17A or both cytokines 12 h after K. pneumoniae infection. We then killed the mice at 24 h after K. pneumoniae infection.\r\n We used murine and human IL-22 Quantikine kits and a human IL-17F Duoset (R&D Systems) to quantify those cytokines. We measured IL-17A protein levels by a 22-plex mouse Luminex assay (Linco\/Millipore).\r\n We obtained mouse cDNAs encompassing the open reading frames of CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL9 by RT-PCR through a two-step approach as described 39 , using primers based on mouse cDNA sequences available in GenBank.

IL-22 is an IL-10 family cytokine member 18 that was originally thought to be predominantly expressed in T H 1 cells and has been shown to induce the antimicrobial peptides human \u03b2defensin 2 and \u03b2-defensin 3; with IL-17A, IL-22 augments expression of the calciumbinding proteins S100A7, S100A8 and S100A9 in skin keratinocytes 19, 20 . Using an experimental model of Gram-negative pneumonia, we show that IL-22 is produced in a time-dependent fashion, similarly to IL-17A and IL-17F ( ref.

We created a 10-\u03bcM wound in well-differentiated, polarized HBE cells and found that the addition of IL-22 at a dose as low as 20 ng\/ml significantly enhanced recovery of epithelial resistance (Fig. 4 online), and Ccl20 expression continued to increase at 16 h. Ccl22 expression, however, showed a steady decline in this model ( Supplementary Fig. To further confirm that T cells produce IL-22 in response to K. pneumoniae, we isolated CD90 + T cells from lungs harvested from infected mice and uninfected controls and then assessed IL-22 precursor frequency by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT). 2g) and significantly more bacterial dissemination to the spleen (Fig. 12 ) mice, Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice had significantly lower amounts of G-CSF and CXCL1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid at 24 h compared to WT mice ( Fig. However, compared to WT mice, mice treated with antibody to IL-22 showed no difference in BAL G-CSF and CXCL1 protein concentrations ( Fig. In contrast to G-CSF, IL-22 was crucial for IL-6 production in the lung, as both antibody to IL-22-treated WT and Il17a \u2212\/\u2212 mice had statistically significant reductions in BAL IL-6 abundance 24 h after infection (Fig. To analyze gene expression in these cells, we performed microarray analysis.

IL-22 expression in vivo is regulated by IL-23, and rescue of Il23a \u2212\/\u2212 mice is associated with increased lung epithelial expression of CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL9. Furthermore, we show that IL-17R signaling is dispensable for host defense to a primary challenge with M. tuberculosis or L. monocytogenes, two intracellular pathogens that require T H 1 immunity.

Here, we review the cellular targets of viruses and the features of the host immune response that are unique to the lungs. We describe the interplay between innate and adaptive immune cells in the induction, expression and control of antiviral immunity, and discuss the impact of the infected lung milieu on moulding the response of antiviral effector T cells. Recent findings on the mechanisms that underlie the increased frequency of severe pulmonary bacterial infections following respiratory virus infection are also discussed.\r\n Viruses are highly evolved and ubiquitous pathogens. Although infection with many viruses results in a mild, self-limited disease, other viruses can produce severe and frequently fatal infections. The respiratory tract is a major portal through which viruses enter to initiate infection. Whereas some viruses can initiate infection in the respiratory tract and then disseminate to other sites in the body, other viruses typically remain localized to the respiratory tract, where they replicate and induce tissue injury (see Supplementary information S1 (table)). Various defence mechanisms have evolved in the respiratory tract to prevent and control infection by viruses and other pathogens.\r\n The respiratory tract can be divided anatomically into the upper respiratory tract (including the nose, mouth and pharynx) and the lower respiratory tract (which consists of the trachea, bronchi and lungs), with the lymphoid tissue of Waldeyer's ring (including the pharyngeal and palatine tonsils) representing the line of demarcation. Because of the crucial role of the lower respiratory tract in respiration, we limit the focus of this Review to recent advances in our understanding of the host immune response to virus infection at this site.","text_body":"Stromal cells (typically CD45 \u2212 non-haematopoietic cells) and haematopoietic cells (CD45 + bone marrow-derived cells) comprise the cellular network of the lower respiratory tract. Although all cell types presumably have important roles during respiratory virus infection, type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells and conducting airway epithelial cells are of particular importance among the CD45 \u2212 stromal cells, as infection of these cells by viruses and the subsequent host immune response can compromise respiratory function and can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells are important cellular targets for infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 1,2 and certain type A influenza virus strains, most notably the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses [3] [4] [5] . Viruses can also target epithelial cells of the conducting airways (Supplementary information S1 (table)).\r\n The severe lung inflammation associated with respiratory infection by certain viruses poses a unique challenge to the immune system: not only must the virus be rapidly eliminated by the immune system, but tissue inflammation must also be controlled to prevent acute respiratory failure. Furthermore, during the recovery or resolution phase of infection, the immune system must help to orchestrate tissue repair to restore normal lung architecture and function and prevent permanent defects in respiratory function.\r\n The contributions of physical and chemical barriers to infection and of the various innate immune mechanisms and cell types that mediate host responses to virus infections have been recently reviewed [6] [7] [8] [9] and are not discussed in detail here (although they are summarized in Supplementary information S2 (box)). Likewise, the function of B cells in immunity to respiratory viruses has been reviewed elsewhere 10 . Here, we primarily focus on recent results regarding the induction of T cell responses to virus infection in the respiratory tract and the role of specific respiratory dendritic cell (DC) subsets and macrophages in controlling this process. In addition, we describe recent findings on the regulation of immunity, pulmonary inflammation and injury during virus infection. Finally, we briefly consider the potential link between respiratory virus infection and chronic respiratory diseases and discuss in more detail the recent findings relating to the effect of respiratory tract virus infection on the susceptibility to concurrent or subsequent bacterial infection (known as bacterial superinfection).\r\n The lungs are bombarded by a plethora of innocuous inhaled antigens and presumably by commensal microorganisms. A unique challenge for lung-resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is to discriminate between invading pathogens and innocuous particles and to deliver only relevant microbial antigens to T cells. The mechanisms of this discrimination in the lungs are poorly understood but ultimately result in the activation of respiratory DCs and their migration to draining lymph nodes.\r\n If intracellular innate immune mechanisms in primary target cells (such as epithelial cells) fail to adequately control early virus replication, and replication proceeds, then released virions and the contents of dying or dead infected cells can be taken up by a variety of APCs 9 ( Table 1 ). The first respiratory tract CD45 + immune cell type to encounter viral antigens is the alveolar macrophage. Not only are alveolar macrophages superb phagocytes that are capable of rapidly eliminating large numbers of microorganisms from the lung, but they also have a crucial role in dampening immune responses at this site 11 . It is widely believed that alveolar macrophages are non-migratory and do not contribute to the induction of adaptive immune responses. However, recent evidence indicates that alveolar macrophages can migrate from the lung to the draining lymph nodes under homeostatic conditions and can serve as antigen carriers following bacterial infection 12 , although their contribution to the induction of adaptive immune responses in the draining lymph nodes is currently undefined.\r\n DCs reside below the airway epithelial cells within the pulmonary interstitium, and they can extend processes between airway epithelial cells, making them strategically poised to sample airway particulates, such as viruses. Several phenotypically and functionally distinct subsets of respiratory DCs have been studied extensively in rodents 13 . These populations include two main resident mature (MHC class II hi CD11c hi ) respiratory DC subsets, which are characterized as CD103 + and CD11b hi CD103 \u2212 respiratory DCs and are crucial for the induction of adaptive immune responses, at least in mice [14] [15] [16] [17] . CD103 + respiratory DCs localize at the mucosal surface, adjacent to the respiratory epithelium, and surround adjoining vasculature. By contrast, the more abundant CD11b hi respiratory DC subset is found within the lung interstitium. CD103 + respiratory DCs express the mannose-binding Ctype lectin langerin (also known as CLEC4K) 16, 18 and require expression of specific transcriptional factors (such as BATF3) for their normal development in the lung and at other mucosal surfaces [19] [20] [21] . Activated CD103 + respiratory DCs produce modest levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, whereas CD11b hi respiratory DCs are major chemokine producers in response to pulmonary inflammation 22 .\r\n Monocyte-derived DCs, which are phenotypically immature (MHC class II low CD11c low ), are more abundant than the mature DC subsets and localize within the interstitium. They can take up particulates in the inflamed lung and migrate to the draining lymph nodes. However, they were found to be poor activators of naive T cells when analysed during experimental virus infections 14 . They may, however, serve as precursors for mature DCs 23 (Fig. 1) . Distinct from these conventional respiratory DCs are plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). pDCs are recognized as major producers of type I interferons IFNs) during infection, and can also transport antigens from the infected lung to the draining lymph nodes. However, the lowlevel expression of co-stimulatory ligands on pDCs renders them weak activators of naive T cells.\r\n In addition to alveolar macrophages, CD11b + (CD11c \u2212 ) tissue-resident macrophageswhich originate from circulating CC-chemokine receptor 2 CCR2) + monocytic subsets in the blood -are found within the non-inflamed pulmonary interstitium 9, 24, 25 . These cells have the capacity to transport antigens from the lungs to the draining lymph nodes during virus infection 14 , although their contribution to the induction of adaptive immune responses is unclear. The number of these macrophages can increase dramatically in response to virus infection, and they may serve as APCs for activated effector T cells in the infected lungs 24,25 (see below). Recent evidence suggests that the increase in the number of macrophages during infection may result both from an influx of blood monocyte precursors and from local cell proliferation 26 .\r\n Respiratory virus infection (and other inflammatory stimuli) triggers antigen uptake by and activation of most types of respiratory DC, resulting in their mobilization and migration out of the infected lungs 9, 27 . Although this process is not fully understood, multiple mediators -including chemokines such as CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL5, CCL20 and CCL21 -probably work in concert to orchestrate respiratory DC activation and mobilization. These chemokines are produced by respiratory epithelial cells and vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells, and then engage their corresponding receptors on respiratory DCs 28, 29 . Additional pro-inflammatory mediators (such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-18) that are released by infected epithelial cells can activate adjacent CD45 \u2212 parenchymal cells, such as fibroblasts 28 . This may increase the expression of \u03b1V\u03b28 integrin on the fibroblasts and subsequent integrin-dependent activation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), resulting in increased secretion of the TGF\u03b2-dependent chemokines CCL2 and CCL20 (Ref. 28) . Similarly, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling in epithelial cells in response to viral proteins upregulates CCL2 and CCL20 expression 29 , which may facilitate the activation and mobilization of DCs within the lung, as well as the recruitment of monocyte progenitors into the lung from the circulation (Fig. 1) .\r\n The infection-induced crosstalk between CD45 \u2212 lung parenchymal cells and mature resident DCs in the inflamed lung leads to the upregulation on the DCs of several chemotactic receptors, most notably CCR7 and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. These receptors are crucial for transendothelial migration of activated respiratory DCs and their egress to the draining lymph nodes 14, 15, 30, 31 . Unlike CD103 + and CD11b hi respiratory DCs, other potential APCs -such as alveolar macrophages, pDCs and monocyte-derived DCs -use as yet unidentified pathways that are independent of CCR7 to enter the draining lymph nodes. Activated respiratory DCs also upregulate their expression of co-stimulatory and adhesion molecules (such as CD40, CD80, CD86 and ICAM1) and of antigen-presenting molecules, and this renders the migrating respiratory DCs competent to serve as potent APCs for the activation of naive virus-specific T cells in the draining lymph nodes.\r\n The migration of respiratory DCs bearing viral antigens to the draining lymph nodes serves to concentrate viral antigens at a site where extremely rare virus-specific adaptive immune cells, such as naive 32, 33 and memory antiviral T cells 34, 35 , can encounter their cognate antigens. Although the transfer of viral antigens from migrant respiratory DCs (and macrophages) to lymph node-resident CD8\u03b1 + DCs has been documented in a respiratory virus infection 36 , several lines of evidence suggest that it is the antigen-bearing migratory DCs that most efficiently present viral antigens to naive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells during respiratory virus infections 14, 17, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] (Table 1) . However, the relative contributions of migratory respiratory DCs and lymph node-resident CD8\u03b1 + DCs to the activation of naive T cells during respiratory virus infection remain to be fully explored and are probably pathogen dependent.\r\n Migrant CD103 + respiratory DCs reach maximum numbers in the draining lymph nodes early (2-4 days) following respiratory virus infection and serve as the most potent APCs for naive virus-specific CD8 + T cells early in the response to an active infection 14, 41 . Furthermore, CD103 + respiratory DCs can efficiently cross-present antigens (such as products of infected cells) that were initially taken up in the lungs, possibly via efferocytosis 42 . The limited data currently available do not allow a definitive determination of whether infected CD103 + respiratory DCs are more potent APCs for naive CD8 + T cells than CD103 + respiratory DCs that cross-present acquired viral antigens 14, 41 . Recently, the superiority of CD103 + respiratory DCs over CD11b hi respiratory DCs in supporting antiviral CD8 + T cell activation during influenza virus infection was linked with their enhanced capacity to process and load viral antigens onto MHC class I molecules for presentation to CD8 + T cells 43 .\r\n CD11b hi respiratory DCs reach peak numbers in the draining lymph nodes at later time points (5-7 days) following influenza virus infection 14, 41 and may act to expand the pool size of previously activated effector CD8 + T cells in the draining lymph nodes through engagement of the co-stimulatory receptor CD27 (Ref. 40) . The speed and magnitude of migratory DC accumulation in the lymph nodes are probably regulated by virus-intrinsic factors, such as replication potential, target cell type and cytotoxic effects, as well as by host-intrinsic factors, such as underlying genetic susceptibility.\r\n Both major migratory respiratory DC subsets also efficiently activate naive virus-specific CD4 + T cells 14 . Furthermore, the influx of inflammatory DCs into the draining lymph nodes from the circulation has an important role in activating potent T helper 1 (T H 1) cell responses to respiratory virus infection 44 . Following the resolution of acute infection, CD103 + and CD11b + respiratory DCs continue to ferry and present residual antigens to memory T cells 34, 35 , and as a consequence they influence the trafficking and recall responses of antiviral memory T cells [45] [46] [47] .\r\n Following their encounter with APCs in the draining lymph nodes, naive (and memory) virus-specific T cells undergo a stepwise process of activation, proliferation and differentiation to become effector T cells that can migrate to the site of infection and mediate antiviral immune responses.\r\n The effector mechanisms used by antiviral T cells can be categorized into three groups. First, there are T cell-associated lytic mechanisms that promote the lysis of infected cells following the exocytosis of perforin-and granzyme-containing granules. Second, T cells can induce tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family-dependent apoptosis of infected cells by expressing CD95 ligand (also known as FAS ligand) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Third, T cells can produce pro-inflammatory mediators (and regulatory mediators (see below)) in response to encounter with virus-infected cells. Much of our current knowledge of these processes and their role in virus clearance has come from studies on the host adaptive immune T cell response to infection by a limited number of respiratory viruses, most notably influenza virus.\r\n Several studies suggest a crucial role for the cytolytic functions of CD8 + effector T cells in influenza virus infection. These functions trigger the direct lysis of virus-infected cells and require T cell receptor-mediated recognition of processed viral antigens on the infected target cell [48] [49] [50] . With certain notable exceptions [51] [52] [53] , the release of particular proinflammatory mediators (such as IFN\u03b3) by CD8 + T cells has only a modest impact on virus clearance and recovery.\r\n There is also recent evidence from the influenza virus model that virus-infected respiratory tract cells (specifically infected alveolar epithelial cells) may be eliminated during the host response through the action of activated lytic macrophages that are capable of triggering the apoptosis of virus-infected cells through a TRAIL-dependent mechanism 54 . Accordingly, activated inflammatory mononuclear cells (rather than effector CD8 + T cells) that express TRAIL and are recruited into the virus-infected lungs could engage alveolar epithelial cells, which upregulate TRAIL receptor early in response to infection, and trigger alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis. The contribution of this mechanism to the control of virus replication and to the development of alveolar damage in the infected respiratory tract awaits further evaluation.\r\n Effector CD4 + T cells have been demonstrated to exhibit cytotoxic activity in vitro, but the contribution of CD4 + T cell cytotoxicity to virus clearance in vivo in the lungs is modest 55, 56 . This cytotoxicity is restricted to viral antigen-bearing cells that express MHC class II molecules; such cells include CD45 + inflammatory mononuclear phagocytic cells and a few CD45 \u2212 lung parenchymal cell types that constitutively (or inducibly) express MHC class II molecules (such as type II alveolar epithelial cells) 57 (Table 1) . Results from experimental infection studies suggest that the primary role of antiviral CD4 + T cells is to support the activation and differentiation of B cells, which leads to antibody production 58, 59 .\r\n The classical view of antiviral effector T cell generation posits that the proliferative expansion necessary for the differentiation of activated naive antiviral T cells into effector T cells occurs primarily, if not exclusively, in the draining lymph nodes. The first hint that this earlier view may be incomplete in the case of respiratory virus infection came from studies demonstrating that activated effector T cells can undergo extensive proliferation in the respiratory tract 60, 61 . More recent studies indicate a requirement for effector T cells in the infected lungs to interact with CD45 + inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes, which produce cytokines (such as IL-15, which they trans-present) and\/or express co-stimulatory molecules (such as CD70) to support the proliferation and sustain the viability of the effector T cells [62] [63] [64] .\r\n In addition, a recent study demonstrated that virus-specific CD8 + effector T cells can produce the regulatory cytokine IL-10 in response to antigenic stimulation but do so only following their migration into the virus-infected lungs 65 . It is noteworthy that a burst of T cell-derived IL-10 production was shown to occur at the time of the initial influx of effector T cells into the lungs. This burst coincides with the peak of production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IFN\u03b3 by the CD8 + effector T cells and with the onset of virus clearance 65 . IL-10-producing effector CD8 + T cells have been shown to simultaneously produce the proinflammatory cytokine IFN\u03b3, and the production of both of these cytokines by CD8 + T cells decreases with virus clearance 65 . It remains to be determined whether this transition from an effector T cell capable of producing pro-inflammatory cytokines in the draining lymph nodes to an effector T cell that can produce both pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines after entering the virus-infected lungs represents a change in the activation state or in the differentiation state of the activated T cell. However, an examination of IL-10 production by CD8 + effector T cells in vivo in infected lungs 66 revealed that the production of this regulatory cytokine required exposure of the T cells in the infected lungs to IL-2 derived from antiviral CD4 + effector T cells and IL-27 produced by inflammatory mononuclear cells and neutrophils. These and other observations 67 favour the view that the exposure of CD8 + effector T cells to pro-inflammatory (IL-27) and survival (IL-2) stimuli in the infected lungs enhances T cell activation, thereby facilitating Il10 gene expression.\r\n An early in vitro analysis of the regulation of T cell effector activity suggested that there was an expressional hierarchy in T cell effector activities that was dependent on the strength of the activating stimulus 68 . According to this analysis, CD8 + T cell cytotoxic activity had the least stringent requirement for co-stimulatory and cytokine signals, followed by T cell proliferation, with proinflammatory cytokine production requiring the strongest costimulatory signals. Very recently, evidence has emerged from an in vivo analysis of T cell responses to respiratory virus infection to support this concept 49 . In this study, effector CD8 + T cell activation by influenza virus-derived antigens that were presented by infected CD45 \u2212 respiratory epithelial cells resulted in T cell-mediated killing of the infected epithelial cells without the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. By contrast, effector CD8 + T cell activation by viral antigens that were presented by interstitial CD45 + inflammatory cells (primarily LY6C hi CD11c + inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes) induced cell-mediated cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the effector CD8 + T cells. The mechanism (or mechanisms) that account for this difference in the T cell response to APC or target cell recognition remains to be fully elucidated.\r\n However, one crucial difference between the recognition of CD45 + APCs and that of CD45 \u2212 target cells by effector T cells is the expression of co-stimulatory ligands by APCs but not by target cells 49, 69 . Indeed, blockade of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 in vitro or in vivo suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by effector CD8 + T cells without affecting their cytotoxic activity in vitro or virus clearance in vivo 49 . Thus, the engagement of co-stimulatory receptors on effector CD8 + T cells by APCs would provide the additional signal strength necessary for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the T cells. Several reports have evaluated the contribution of specific co-stimulatory receptor-ligand interactions in regulating the host adaptive immune response and the outcome of respiratory virus infection [70] [71] [72] [73] . However, in most instances no specific distinction was made between the contribution of these co-stimulatory receptor-ligand interactions during the induction phase of the response in the draining lymph nodes and during the effector phase in the infected lungs.\r\n The above results may have important implications for therapeutic intervention in respiratory tract infections with viruses (such as influenza virus) in which productive infection (that is production of infectious virions) is restricted to CD45 \u2212 respiratory epithelial cells. More generally, these observations add to the emerging picture that, after entering the infected lungs, effector T cells are altered or moulded by the inflammatory milieu encountered in situ. Such alterations could include changes in activation state (such as increased avidity of the T cell receptor for its target peptide-MHC complex on APCs), in effector activity (such as the types and\/or amounts of mediators produced) and in viability, and possibly the differentiation of certain effector T cells into memory T cells 49, 63, 69, 71, 74 .\r\n Multiple cell types express immunosuppressive molecules 75 to maintain pulmonary homeostasis. This suppressive state is disrupted by the action of innate and adaptive immune cells responding to infection. Their responses facilitate virus clearance but also can produce excessive pulmonary inflammation and tissue damage (reviewed in Ref. 76) (Fig. 2) .\r\n Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) + regulatory T (T Reg ) cells have an important role in maintaining immune homeostasis by suppressing inflammation in naive hosts. However, it has recently been demonstrated that activated T Reg cells can acquire unique phenotypes that enhance their ability to control exaggerated inflammation 77, 78 . Following respiratory virus infection, T Reg cells in the lungs have been shown to express 'effector' T Reg cell markers. For instance, the expression of the T H 1 cell-associated transcription factor T-bet is upregulated in lung T Reg cells during influenza virus infection 65 and is associated with enhanced T Reg cell-mediated suppression of excessive T H 1-type inflammatory responses 79 . Similarly, BLIMP1 (B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1; also known as PRDM1), which is required for the terminal differentiation of effector T cells, is necessary for the enhanced production of IL-10 by T Reg cells during influenza virus infection 65, 67 . The depletion of T Reg cells leads to excessive pulmonary inflammation and injury during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection [80] [81] [82] . Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of T Reg cells into recombination-activating gene (RAG)-deficient mice (which lack B and T cells) controls the otherwise lethal inflammation mediated by innate immune cells during influenza virus infection 83 . These data suggest that T Reg cells may be crucial for controlling acute host inflammation and for restoring lung homeostasis following respiratory virus infection, although the mechanisms underlying these functions are poorly understood.\r\n In addition to effector T Reg cells, conventional effector CD4 + and CD8 + T cells have recently been shown to exert a 'regulatory' function through the production of high levels of IL-10 during influenza virus, RSV or simian virus 5 infection 65, 84, 85 . Blocking T cell-derived IL-10 results in excessive pulmonary inflammation characterized by increased accumulation of CD45 + inflammatory cells and enhanced production of proinflammatory mediators during influenza virus or RSV infection 65, 85, 86 . As mentioned above, the production of IL-10 by effector T cells is primarily restricted to the site of infection rather than the site of T cell priming, suggesting that the local environment of the infected lungs can instruct the function of effector T cells 65, 84 .\r\n Various innate immune cell types may also act to suppress excessive inflammation arising from antiviral immune responses (Table 1) . pDCs have a crucial role in restricting excessive T cell-mediated inflammation during experimental RSV infection through an unknown mechanism 87 . In addition, neutrophils can facilitate viral clearance and dampen inflammation 88 , and lung epithelial cells can inhibit the over-exuberant inflammatory activities of macrophages through the expression of the inhibitory molecule CD200 during influenza virus infection 11 . Furthermore, classically activated phagocytes (such as inflammatory DCs and macrophages) can be significant contributors to disease pathogenesis during influenza virus infection 24, 25, 54 , whereas alternatively activated macrophages have a regulatory function in RSV infection, dampening virus-induced inflammation driven by innate immune cells 89 . Of note, activation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) -a transcription factor that controls the differentiation of monocyte precursors into alternatively activated macrophages 90 -suppresses lethal inflammation during influenza virus infection 25 . Therefore, the differentiation state of the responding immune cell may have a crucial role in the resolution of inflammation and the outcome of virus infection ( Table 1 ).\r\n The immunosuppressive cytokine TGF\u03b21 is constitutively expressed by many lung cell types, most notably epithelial cells, which express the integrins required to convert latent TGF\u03b21 into the active form and can therefore maintain immune homeostasis in the normal lung 75 . Administration of TGF\u03b21 to mice during influenza virus or RSV infection impairs virus clearance but suppresses the associated lung inflammation 91 , whereas inhibition of TGF\u03b21 during influenza virus infection results in lethal tissue injury 92 . Interestingly, whereas the neuraminidase protein from certain influenza virus strains can process latent TGF\u03b21 into its active form and thereby potentially dampen pulmonary inflammation during infection, neuraminidase from the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus cannot process TGF\u03b21 (Ref. 92) . Therefore the ability (or inability) of a virus to activate or inhibit host immunoregulatory mechanisms (such as TGF\u03b21 activation) may contribute to viral pathogenesis. So, there appear to be multiple layers of immunoregulation during acute respiratory virus infection at both the cellular level (such as T Reg cells and other cells) and the molecular level (such as IL-10, CD200 and TGF\u03b21) (Fig. 2 ).\r\n Epidemiological evidence has clearly suggested that respiratory virus infection, in particular type A influenza virus infection, increases the incidence and severity of secondary bacterial infections in the respiratory tract 93 . Histological analyses of infected lung tissue indicates that bacterial superinfection resulting in secondary bacterial pneumonia was the predominant cause of death during the 1918 type A influenza virus pandemic and the more recent H1N1 pandemic 94, 95 . In a mouse model of bacterial superinfection, type A influenza virus infection increases the susceptibility of mice to various bacterial infections, including respiratory challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus or Haemophilus influenzae and systemic Listeria monocytogenes infection 96, 97 . Increased susceptibility to bacterial superinfection typically starts as early as day 3 and continues until at least 2 weeks post type A influenza virus infection. The prevailing opinion to explain this susceptibility to superinfection has, for many years, been that type A influenza virus infection damages epithelial cells and degrades the barrier function of the epithelium, thereby facilitating bacterial colonization of the respiratory tract 93 . However, evidence has emerged over the past decade suggesting that type A influenza virus infection also alters the function of innate and adaptive immune cells, resulting in a failure to effectively control bacterial replication (Fig. 3) .\r\n Among the various immune cell types, lung-resident alveolar macrophages are the first line of defence against bacteria in the respiratory tract, as they are capable of both limiting bacterial outgrowth and orchestrating the recruitment and activation of other immune cells to restrict bacterial growth. Type A influenza virus infection reduces the numbers of alveolar macrophages by promoting their apoptosis and also suppresses the function of these cells through direct mechanisms (such as infection of the macrophages) and indirect mechanisms (via host factors induced by the infection) 98, 99 . Alveolar macrophages from lungs infected with type A influenza virus show increased expression of the CD200 receptor (CD200R), ligation of which suppresses alveolar macrophage activation in response to secondary bacterial challenge 100 . Furthermore, alveolar macrophages from virus-infected lungs exhibit decreased expression of the scavenger receptor MARCO (macrophage receptor with collagenous structure) and a diminished ability to ingest bacteria 99 . They also produce only low levels of the cytokines and chemokines required for orchestrating the responses of other cell types against bacterial infection, such as neutrophil recruitment and activation 98 . The diminished chemokine production by alveolar macrophages from virus-infected lungs is associated with decreased translocation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) to the nucleus of alveolar macrophages as a result of as yet unidentified mechanisms 98 . The desensitization of alveolar macrophages can last for several months after influenza virus infection. Therefore, given the important role of alveolar macrophages in the initial control of bacterial infection, these data suggest that individuals who have recovered from severe influenza virus infection may have compromised immunity to subsequent bacterial infections for extended time periods.\r\n In addition to suppressing alveolar macrophages, influenza virus infection inhibits the recruitment of circulating monocytes and macrophages during responses to bacterial challenge through type I IFN-dependent mechanisms 101 . Neutrophils have a crucial role in clearing pulmonary bacterial infection, but those isolated from influenza virus-infected lungs exhibit impaired responses to bacterial challenge 102 . Indeed, influenza virus infection of (or binding to) neutrophils in vitro results in a direct inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis and superoxide production 103 . In vivo, influenza virus can directly infect neutrophils in the lung and, thus, may directly suppress the function of neutrophils during secondary bacterial challenge 104 . Furthermore, type I IFN production induced during primary influenza virus infection can directly inhibit neutrophil infiltration into the lung and\/or increase the apoptosis of neutrophils 105 .\r\n Natural killer (NK) cells, via their release of antibacterial factors, can also serve as important effector cells during certain bacterial infections 106 . However, NK cells isolated from influenza virus-infected lungs show decreased production of the antibacterial effector cytokine TNF 106 , although the mechanisms underlying this defect in NK cell function during influenza virus infection remain elusive. NK cells are reported to be susceptible to infection by influenza virus, and infected NK cells have various defects in effector activities such as cytotoxicity and cytokine and chemokine production 107 .\r\n Influenza virus infection induces highly polarized T H 1-type immune responses characterized by the production of IFN\u03b3. Of note, neutralization of IFN\u03b3 during influenza virus infection restores MARCO expression by macrophages, increases bacterial ingestion and killing by macrophages and enhances host resistance to secondary bacterial infection 99 . Highly polarized CD4 + T H 1 cells and type 1 CD8 + cytotoxic T cells are also a major source of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 during influenza virus infection 65, 108 . IL-10 has been implicated in the susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections following influenza virus infection. In one study, the blockade of IL-10 enhanced the clearance of a secondary infection with S. pneumoniae 109 . However, the role of IL-10 during secondary bacterial infection remains controversial, as two recent reports using IL-10-deficient mice found a minimal role for IL-10 in regulating host susceptibility to secondary bacterial challenge 99, 105 . T H 17 cell responses are also crucial for host resistance to challenges with certain bacteria, including S. pneumoniae and S. aureus 110 , and influenza virus-induced production of type I IFNs has been shown to suppress the subsequent development of T H 17 cells in response to bacterial superinfection 110 .\r\n In summary, emerging evidence suggests that one or more of the regulatory mechanisms (for example, the expression of CD200R, IL-10 and\/or TGF\u03b21) that are used by innate and adaptive immune cells to suppress excess inflammation during acute respiratory virus infections may facilitate bacterial colonization by diminishing the recruitment and function of phagocytes and the subsequent destruction of bacterial pathogens (Fig. 3) . If immune mechanisms aimed at controlling virus replication and\/or excessive inflammation in the virus-infected lungs predispose the individual to bacterial superinfection, then therapeutic strategies to prevent bacterial superinfection in the lungs must balance the need to prevent virus replication and excessive inflammation during virus clearance with the need to optimize the antibacterial functions of innate immune phagocytes.\r\n Lower respiratory tract virus infections can, if severe, also alter lung function for an extended period after virus clearance and potentially predispose to, or at least exacerbate, chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Box 1).\r\n The recent advances in the identification and characterization of distinct subsets of DCs within the respiratory tract, along with the elucidation of their functions as APCs before and during virus infection, offer the promise of developing newer and more effective vaccination strategies against viral and other respiratory tract pathogens. The emerging evidence that the spectrum of effector activity exhibited by antiviral CD8 + T cells may differ depending on the level of co-stimulation that they receive raises the possibility that in the case of respiratory viruses, for which replication is restricted to respiratory epithelium, excessive inflammation associated with severe infection can be controlled by blocking co-stimulatory signals, without altering immune-mediated virus clearance.\r\n More generally, recent evidence strongly suggests that the activation state and function of effector T cells in virus-infected lungs are sculpted by the local milieu generated by the resident and infiltrating inflammatory cells and the factors that they produce in response to virus infection. This additional moulding of the immune response at the site of infection will have an impact on the process of virus clearance and an equally important effect on the regulation of acute inflammation, and possibly immunological memory.\r\n Resolution of respiratory virus infection requires not only the elimination of the virus but also the repair and regeneration of normal lung structures and, most importantly, the restoration of normal pulmonary function. Although at present the resolution response is only poorly understood and appreciated, the cells and molecules of the innate and adaptive immune system that respond to virus infection in the lower respiratory tract will almost certainly be shown to contribute. Whether and how these cells and molecules regulate processes such as epithelial cell to mesenchymal cell transitions, as well as the transformation of fibroblasts and fibrocytes into myofibroblasts, will become an area of intense research, as dysregulation of these processes in response to lung inflammation is associated with progressive pulmonary injury and lung fibrosis.\r\n Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\r\n We thank the members of the Braciale laboratory for their editorial assistance and insightful discussions, and colleagues in the field who provided recent publications and personal communications.

The process usually triggers an antiinflammatory response.\r\n Dendritic cells (DCs) that are not normally present in the steady state but develop as a result of inflammation or microbial stimuli. For example, one such subset is tumour necrosis factor-and inducible nitric oxide synthase-producing DCs (TIP DCs). Inflammatory monocytes can also give rise to inflammatory DCs.\r\n A regulatory T (T Reg ) cell that expresses particular transcription factors, such as T-bet, and follows a differentiation pathway to acquire a phenotype or function for efficiently controlling a specific subset of effector T cells, such as T H 1 cells.\r\n (Also known as M2 macrophages).

There may be pathogen-associated molecular patterns expressed by helminths that can also drive the alternative activation of macrophages.\r\n (ILCs; also known as natural helper cells and nuocytes). Cells that combine innate and adaptive immune functions and are part of the first line of defence against mucosal infections. ILCs are distinguished from adaptive lymphocytes by their independence from recombination-activating genes and the resulting absence of specific antigen receptors. They produce large quantities of type 2 cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13.\r\n Mature fibroblasts that no longer produce fibres or intercellular substance in connective tissue. Fibroblasts are large, flat cells that form the collagenous and elastic fibres and intercellular substance of loose connective tissue.\r\n Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a crucial regulator of the development of chronic airway diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 111, 112 . It has also been shown to have an essential role in various models of virus-induced airway diseases, although the specific cellular sources of IL-13 differ among the various models. Classically, T helper 2 (T H 2) cells are thought to be responsible for the development of asthma-like diseases following infection by a respiratory virus, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 113 or Sendai virus 114 . In a model of Sendai virus-induced chronic disease, IL-13 production by invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and alternatively activated macrophages induced persistent mucus production and airway inflammation 115 .\r\n In influenza virus-induced airway hyperreactivity, IL-13 was primarily produced by the recently described type 2 innate lymphoid cells 116, 117 (ILC2 cells; also known as nuocytes and natural helper cells 118 ) in response to IL-33 and was responsible for the induction of airway hyperreactivity during the acute phase of influenza virus infection. Interestingly, ILC2 cells also have an important role in the repair of the damaged lung during influenza virus infection through a mechanism dependent on amphiregulin (an epidermal growth factor family member) 119 . This suggests that the development of chronic diseases following acute respiratory virus infection may be an aberrant byproduct of the lung repair process.\r\n Virus infection of respiratory epithelial cells is first detected by cytosolic and\/or endosomal innate sensors in the infected epithelial cells (not shown). Recognition of the invading virus by these innate immune receptors leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-18, and chemokines such as CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). These soluble mediators that are released by infected cells activate adjacent CD45 \u2212 parenchymal cells, such as fibroblasts and epithelial cells, and neighbouring innate immune cells. Following activation, these cells convert latent transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) to an active form, resulting in increased secretion of the chemokines CCL2 and CCL20 by parenchymal stromal cells and of cytokines such as IL-12 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by inflammatory cells. This enhanced production of chemokines and cytokines facilitates the maturation of tissue-resident CD103 + and CD11b + dendritic cells (DCs) and the recruitment and maturation of monocyte-derived DCs. Antigen acquisition and activation of immature antigen-bearing respiratory DCs results in their mobilization and migration out of the infected lungs along chemokine gradients of CCL21 and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) to the lymph nodes draining the infected lung. Once in the lymph nodes, these DCs participate in initiating adaptive immune responses to the respiratory virus (not shown).\r\n Molecules derived from both innate and adaptive immune cells contribute to the regulation of excessive pulmonary inflammation during acute respiratory virus infection. CD4 + T helper 1 (T H 1) cells and type 1 CD8 + cytotoxic T cells (T C 1 cells) express the transcription factors T-bet and BLIMP1 (B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1) and produce high levels of the regulatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), in addition to effector cytokines and cytolytic molecules, during respiratory virus infection. Regulatory T (T Reg ) cells in the lungs also express the 'effector' transcription factors T-bet and BLIMP1, produce various immunoregulatory cytokines (including IL-10 and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF\u03b21)) and express the inhibitory receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4). Lung epithelial cells express CD200 and are required for the control of exuberant activation of classically activated macrophages. By contrast, alternatively activated macrophages contribute to the control of excessive pulmonary inflammation. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) also contribute to the suppression of excessive T cell-mediated inflammation through an unidentified mechanism. iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; PPAR\u03b3,\r\n Multiple distinct mechanisms have been postulated to account for the increased susceptibility to bacterial superinfection and bacterial pneumonia following infection with respiratory viruses such as type A influenza viruses. Influenza virus infection induces the production of type I interferons (IFNs), which inhibit the recruitment of circulating neutrophils and macrophages to the lung following bacterial challenge. Type I IFNs also inhibit the differentiation of antibacterial T helper 17 (T H 17) cells from naive T cells (T H 0 cells) or other T H cell types (such as T H 1 and T H 2 cells) 110 and thereby potentiate host susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection. IFN\u03b3 production by influenza virus-specific effector T cells decreases the expression of macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) by alveolar macrophages and inhibits the ingestion of bacteria by these cells. Moreover, interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by influenza virus-specific effector T cells may inhibit the ability of innate immune cells, in particular macrophages, to kill bacteria. Finally, the direct interaction and\/or infection of innate immune cells -such as macrophages, neutrophils and natural killer (NK) cells -with influenza virus suppresses the ability of these cells to take up and kill bacteria.","sha":"6686e00d914007e053a17a5c97bdc0eea4316fc6","publish_time":"2012-03-09","authors":"Braciale, Thomas J.; Sun, Jie; Kim, Taeg S.","journal":"Nature Reviews Immunology","doi":"10.1038\/nri3166","Title":"Nature Reviews Immunology","H index":351.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Stromal cells (typically CD45 \u2212 non-haematopoietic cells) and haematopoietic cells (CD45 + bone marrow-derived cells) comprise the cellular network of the lower respiratory tract. The lungs are bombarded by a plethora of innocuous inhaled antigens and presumably by commensal microorganisms. DCs reside below the airway epithelial cells within the pulmonary interstitium, and they can extend processes between airway epithelial cells, making them strategically poised to sample airway particulates, such as viruses. Distinct from these conventional respiratory DCs are plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). In addition to alveolar macrophages, CD11b + (CD11c \u2212 ) tissue-resident macrophageswhich originate from circulating CC-chemokine receptor 2 CCR2) + monocytic subsets in the blood -are found within the non-inflamed pulmonary interstitium 9, 24, 25 . The number of these macrophages can increase dramatically in response to virus infection, and they may serve as APCs for activated effector T cells in the infected lungs 24,25 (see below). Recent evidence suggests that the increase in the number of macrophages during infection may result both from an influx of blood monocyte precursors and from local cell proliferation 26 . Respiratory virus infection (and other inflammatory stimuli) triggers antigen uptake by and activation of most types of respiratory DC, resulting in their mobilization and migration out of the infected lungs 9, 27 . The infection-induced crosstalk between CD45 \u2212 lung parenchymal cells and mature resident DCs in the inflamed lung leads to the upregulation on the DCs of several chemotactic receptors, most notably CCR7 and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. Although the transfer of viral antigens from migrant respiratory DCs (and macrophages) to lymph node-resident CD8\u03b1 + DCs has been documented in a respiratory virus infection 36 , several lines of evidence suggest that it is the antigen-bearing migratory DCs that most efficiently present viral antigens to naive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells during respiratory virus infections 14, 17, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] (Table 1) . Furthermore, the influx of inflammatory DCs into the draining lymph nodes from the circulation has an important role in activating potent T helper 1 (T H 1) cell responses to respiratory virus infection 44 . Second, T cells can induce tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family-dependent apoptosis of infected cells by expressing CD95 ligand (also known as FAS ligand) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). There is also recent evidence from the influenza virus model that virus-infected respiratory tract cells (specifically infected alveolar epithelial cells) may be eliminated during the host response through the action of activated lytic macrophages that are capable of triggering the apoptosis of virus-infected cells through a TRAIL-dependent mechanism 54 . The contribution of this mechanism to the control of virus replication and to the development of alveolar damage in the infected respiratory tract awaits further evaluation. More recent studies indicate a requirement for effector T cells in the infected lungs to interact with CD45 + inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes, which produce cytokines (such as IL-15, which they trans-present) and\/or express co-stimulatory molecules (such as CD70) to support the proliferation and sustain the viability of the effector T cells [62] [63] [64] . This burst coincides with the peak of production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IFN\u03b3 by the CD8 + effector T cells and with the onset of virus clearance 65 . Indeed, blockade of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 in vitro or in vivo suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by effector CD8 + T cells without affecting their cytotoxic activity in vitro or virus clearance in vivo 49 . Multiple cell types express immunosuppressive molecules 75 to maintain pulmonary homeostasis. Histological analyses of infected lung tissue indicates that bacterial superinfection resulting in secondary bacterial pneumonia was the predominant cause of death during the 1918 type A influenza virus pandemic and the more recent H1N1 pandemic 94, 95 . Furthermore, alveolar macrophages from virus-infected lungs exhibit decreased expression of the scavenger receptor MARCO (macrophage receptor with collagenous structure) and a diminished ability to ingest bacteria 99 . The desensitization of alveolar macrophages can last for several months after influenza virus infection. However, NK cells isolated from influenza virus-infected lungs show decreased production of the antibacterial effector cytokine TNF 106 , although the mechanisms underlying this defect in NK cell function during influenza virus infection remain elusive. NK cells are reported to be susceptible to infection by influenza virus, and infected NK cells have various defects in effector activities such as cytotoxicity and cytokine and chemokine production 107 . Highly polarized CD4 + T H 1 cells and type 1 CD8 + cytotoxic T cells are also a major source of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 during influenza virus infection 65, 108 . In summary, emerging evidence suggests that one or more of the regulatory mechanisms (for example, the expression of CD200R, IL-10 and\/or TGF\u03b21) that are used by innate and adaptive immune cells to suppress excess inflammation during acute respiratory virus infections may facilitate bacterial colonization by diminishing the recruitment and function of phagocytes and the subsequent destruction of bacterial pathogens (Fig. The emerging evidence that the spectrum of effector activity exhibited by antiviral CD8 + T cells may differ depending on the level of co-stimulation that they receive raises the possibility that in the case of respiratory viruses, for which replication is restricted to respiratory epithelium, excessive inflammation associated with severe infection can be controlled by blocking co-stimulatory signals, without altering immune-mediated virus clearance. More generally, recent evidence strongly suggests that the activation state and function of effector T cells in virus-infected lungs are sculpted by the local milieu generated by the resident and infiltrating inflammatory cells and the factors that they produce in response to virus infection.

CXCL10 may not be a bystander to the severe virus infection but may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of neutrophil-mediated, excessive pulmonary inflammation. Objectives: We investigated the contribution of CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 axis to the pathogenesis of ARDS with nonviral and viral origins. Methods: We induced nonviral ARDS by acid aspiration and viral ARDS by intratracheal influenza virus infection in wild-type mice and mice deficient in CXCL10, CXCR3, IFNAR1 (IFN-a\/b receptor 1), or TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-b (TRIF). Measurements and Main Results: We found that the mice lacking CXCL10 or CXCR3 demonstrated improved severity and survival of nonviral and viral ARDS, whereas mice that lack IFNAR1 did not control the severity of ARDS in vivo. The increased levels of CXCL10 in lungs with ARDS originate to a large extent from infiltrated pulmonary neutrophils, which express a unique CXCR3 receptor via TRIF. CXCL10-CXCR3 acts in an autocrine fashion on the oxidative burst and chemotaxis in the inflamed neutrophils, leading to fulminant pulmonary inflammation. Conclusions: CXCL10-CXCR3 signaling appears to be a critical factor for the exacerbation of the pathology of ARDS. Thus, the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis could represent a prime therapeutic target in the treatment of the acute phase of ARDS of nonviral and viral origins.","text_body":"as 60% (3) . The natural history of ARDS is marked by exudative (acute), proliferative (subacute), and fibrotic (late) phases. Many patients die in the acute fulminant phase of ARDS, which is characterized by an extremely severe pulmonary inflammatory response accompanied by massive neutrophil accumulation, increased vascular permeability, and high production of cytokines and chemokines (i.e., IL-6, IL-1b, and IL-8)a so-called \"cytokine storm\" (4, 5) . To date, no effective drugs targeting the underlying pathophysiology have been proven to improve clinical outcomes in ARDS (1, 2) . Because of its high lethality and the threats of emerging respiratory virus infections, it is important to identify novel therapeutic targets for ARDS. Patients infected by SARS coronavirus (6) or H5N1 avian influenza (7) who developed ARDS exhibited unusually high levels of C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), also known as IFN-g-induced protein 10 kD (IP-10), which binds the CXCR3 receptor, inducing chemotaxis, apoptosis, cell growth, and angiostasis (8, 9, 10) . Recent highly pathogenic H5N1 virus isolates appear to be even more potent inducers of CXCL10 compared with their less pathogenic earlier counterparts (11) (12) (13) , suggesting a possible impact of increased CXCL10 levels on disease severity. However, it was previously believed that higher CXCL10 levels were a sequel to virus infections with increased activation of the JAK\/STAT pathway (14) , and whether CXCL10 contributed directly to the pathogenesis of severe virus-induced ARDS remained unclear. On the other hand, Mob-1 (the rat homolog of human CXCL10) is increased in nonviral experimental lung injury (e.g., IL-2-induced lung injury in rats) (15, 16) , although the precise mechanisms remained unclear.\r\n In the present study, we hypothesized that CXCL10 and its receptor, CXCR3, can actively participate in the pathogenesis of the fulminant phase of viral-and nonviral-induced ARDS. Our data also show that mice deficient in CXCL10 or its receptor CXCR3 have decreased lung injury severity and increased survival in response to viral (influenza virus infection) and nonviral (acid aspiration) lung injury. Although CXCR3 was previously believed not to be present on neutrophils (17) , we demonstrated the presence of a unique neutrophil population expressing CXCR3 in the inflamed lungs. Mechanistically, CXCL10-CXCR3 acts in an autocrine fashion on the oxidative burst and chemotaxis in inflamed neutrophils, enhancing fulminant inflammation. Moreover, IFN-b 1 was elevated in lungs of viral and nonviral lung injury. To date, it has been controversial as to whether IFN-a\/b can contribute to the pathogenesis of severe respiratory virus infection; IFN-a\/b receptor 1 (IFNAR1)-deficient mice have accelerated mortality as a result of H5N1 influenza virus (18) but not SARS-coronavirus infection (19) . To examine if IFN-a\/b can control the severity of ARDS, we analyzed IFNAR1 knockout (KO) mice using viral and nonviral lung injury models. We found that IFNAR1deficient mice were not protected from severe lung injury. Thus, the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis may be a prime therapeutic target in the treatment of the acute phase of ARDS of either nonviral or viral origin.\r\n The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Turin, Italy). We studied 10 patients with ARDS, aged 68 6 10 years (range, 49-82), who had underlying diagnosis of sepsis (n \u00bc 4), bone marrow (BM) transplant (n \u00bc 2), pneumonia (n \u00bc 3), and multiple trauma (n \u00bc 1), who were ventilated with a VT of 8 6 1 ml\/kg body weight and a mean positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 16 6 4 cm H 2 O. Patients who had extrapulmonary diseases requiring mechanical ventilation served as control subjects (n \u00bc 4). For bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), patients were sedated, and bronchoscopically guided lavage (instillation of 300 ml 0.9% NaCl) was performed in the middle lobe. Aliquots (20 ml) were instilled and immediately reaspirated. The lavage fluid was diluted to a final volume of 50 ml and filtered through four layers of gauze to eliminate remaining mucus. Samples were stored in aliquots of 50 ml at 280 8 C until assayed.\r\n Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). cxcl10 (36) , cxcr3 (37) , and trif (38) mutant mice have been previously described. Ifnar1 mutant mice were obtained from B&K Universal (Grimston, UK). Background of cxcl10 (36), cxcr3 (37), trif (38) , and Ifnar1 mutant mice are C57BL\/6. C57BL\/6 mice were bred at our animal facility. Only sex-and agematched C57BL\/6 mice were used as controls. Basal lung function and lung structure were comparable among all the mice tested. Mice were housed in accordance with institutional guidelines.\r\n Anesthetized (ketamine hydrochloride: 10 mg\/kg\/h and xylazine: 2 mg\/kg\/h) rats (400-450 g) were ventilated with a volume-controlled constant flow inflation ventilator (Voltek Enterprises, Toronto, Canada). A carotid arterial line was used to measure arterial blood pressure (Pd 23; Gould, Inc., Cleveland, OH) and to obtain blood for arterial blood gases (Ciba-Corning Model 248; Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). Lactated Ringer solution (10 ml\/kg\/h) was infused intravenously. After intratracheal instillation of HCl (pH \u00bc 1.5; 2 ml\/kg), rats were ventilated for 3 hours (FI O 2 , 1.0; PEEP, 2.5 cm H 2 O). After 3 hours of ventilation, left lungs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction, and right lungs were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for pathological examination. Control rats were sacrificed after surgical preparation without acid instillation. Total PEEP (PEEPt) and Pplateau pressure (Pplat) were measured at the end of expiratory and inspiratory occlusion, respectively. Every 30 minutes, elastance was calculated as (Pplat 2 PEEPt)\/VT.\r\n We used a previously described mouse acid aspiration-induced ARDS model (similar to the rat model described above) for the CXCL10 blockade study (22, 39) . Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (75 mg\/kg) and xylazine (20 mg\/kg) intraperitoneally, tracheostomized, and ventilated with flexiVent system (SCIREQ Inc., Montreal, Canada). Volume recruitment maneuvers (VRM) were performed to standardize volume history, and measurements were made at baseline. After intratracheal instillation of HCl (pH \u00bc 1.5; 2 ml\/kg), followed by a VRM, mice were ventilated for 3 hours (FI O 2 , 1.0; PEEP, 2.5 cm H 2 O). Saline-treated groups served as controls. Using flexi-Vent system with low-frequency forced oscillations (SCIREQ Inc.), we measured airway elastance as well as tissue elastance in mice, in which input impedance of the respiratory system (Zrs) is measured over a frequency range from 0.25 to 20 Hz. A model including an airway compartment comprising a frequency-independent airway inertance and a constant-phase tissue compartment comprising coefficients of tissue elastance can be fitted to Zrs, allowing the partitioning of lung function into components representing the mechanical properties of the airways and lung tissue, as described previously (23) . At the end of the experiment, left lungs were assessed for lung wet\/dry weight ratios or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent biochemical analysis. Right lungs were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histological examination. In separate experiments, BAL (1 ml of PBS 3 3) and differential cell counts were performed. For CXCL10 neutralization with anti-CXCL10 antibodies, C57BL\/6 mice received either 50 mg intraperitoneally of anti-mouse CXCL10 (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) or isotype-matched control antibodies 30 minutes before surgical procedures. After acid instillation, mice were randomized to four groups: (1) control Ab, saline; (2) anti-CXCL10 Ab, saline; (3) control Ab, acid; (4) anti-CXCL10 Ab, acid. Mice were ventilated for 3 hours and analyzed as described above.\r\n Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (75 mg\/kg) and xylazine (20 mg\/kg). The trachea was exposed by opening the neck skin and blunt dissection. A 24-gauge intravenous catheter was inserted into the trachea. Mice received either the suspension of influenza virus (PR8\/H1N1) 66.7 3 LD 50 (1 3 10 4 TCID 50 ) or 10 3 LD 50 (1.5 3 10 3 TCID 50 ) in 50 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or same volume of PBS through the intratracheal catheter. Mice were monitored daily and weighed every 24 hours after infection. In separate experiments, respiratory function was analyzed at Days 1, 2, and 5 after infection using the flexiVent system (SCIREQ Inc.). In brief, mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (75 mg\/kg) and xylazine (20 mg\/kg), tracheostomized, and connected via the endotracheal cannula to a ventilator (FlexiVent; SCIREQ, Inc.). Mice were ventilated at rate of 150 breaths\/min at a VT of 10 ml\/kg. We measured airway elastance as well as tissue elastance in mice at 1, 2, and 5 days after infection with influenza virus or mock controls, as described above (23) . was obtained from the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (Padova, Italy). The strain was isolated and characterized according to European guidelines (CEC 92\/40). Briefly, the virus was inoculated into 9-to 11-day-old specific pathogen-free embryonated fowl eggs by the allantoic route. Hemagglutinating allantoic fluid was collected from eggs, and the isolated virus was inactivated using b-propiolactone. Virus inactivation was confirmed by reinoculation with two blind passages, and viruses were serotyped to confirm specific influenza H5N1 subtype. For in vivo acute lung injury (ALI) experiments (22) , control wild-type (WT) and CXCL10 KO mice were surgically prepared and ventilated with a volume-controlled constant flow inflation ventilator (Voltek Enterprises, Toronto, Canada) as described above. Then, inactivated H5N1 virus particles (150 mg RNA) and controls (vehicle) were instilled intratracheally, followed by a VRM (35 cm H 2 O, 3 s). Mice were then ventilated for 5 hours (FI O 2 , 1.0; PEEP, 2.5 cm H 2 O). PEEPt and Pplat were measured at the end of expiratory and inspiratory occlusion, respectively. Every 30 minutes, airway elastance was calculated as (Pplat 2 PEEPt)\/VT.\r\n For TCID 50 assay, aliquots of culture supernatants or tissue lysates were 10-fold serially diluted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, applied in quadruplicate to 2 3 10 4 MDCK cells\/well of a 96-well plate, and incubated at 37 8 C for 1 hour. The inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS and supplied with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and trypsin (5 mg\/ml). On the third day after infection, the TCID 50 was determined on the basis of the Karber method. For focus-forming unit assay, an immunofluorescence-based titration assay was conducted as described previously (40) . Briefly, MDCK cells were plated on 2 3 10 4 cells\/well of a 96-well plate (Asahi Techno Glass). At 24 hours after infection with serially diluted supernatants or tissue lysates containing virus, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and washed with PBS three times. Antibody that reacts with common sequences of avian influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein 1 (M1) (41) was used as a primary antibody to detect viral antigen (H1N1). Antibody binding to viral proteins was detected with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) diluted 1:300 in PBS containing 0.35% bovine serum albumin.\r\n BM transplantation was performed in mice as described (22) . In brief, recipient mice were irradiated with 1,200 rads. Bones were flushed with RPMI (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) with 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA) from both femurs and tibias under sterile conditions. Harvested BM cells (1 3 10 6 ) in 200 ml of media were delivered intravenously through the tail vein of each recipient mouse. Recipient mice were housed in a barrier facility (individually ventilated cages, high-energy particulate arresting filterfiltered air), under pathogen-free conditions before and after BM transplantation. Recipient chimeras were used for experiments 12 weeks after transplantation.\r\n In an acid-aspiration-induced ALI model in rats, total RNA was isolated from rat lung tissue at 3 hours by using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Pooled RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) rat RGUA34 GeneChips in duplicate. The analysis for differential gene expression of the Affymetrix RGU34a chips was performed using R packages from Bioconductor (21) . Raw CEL files were normalized with the RMA method from the \"Affy\" package. In a influenza virusinduced ALI model in mice, total RNA was extracted from lung tissue in mice treated with influenza virus (PR8\/H1N1) (influenza [PR8] group) or mock-infected mice (control [PBS] group) at 24 hours after infection and hybridized to Illumina mouse Ref-8 v2.0 GeneChips. The calculation of the log fold-changes and the moderated t statistics was accomplished using the Limma package (42) . For KEGG pathway enrichment analysis we used DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (NIH).\r\n Blood samples were obtained from the left ventricle, and Pa O 2 was measured (Ciba-Corning Model 248; Bayer) to assess arterial blood oxygenation as an indicator for respiratory failure.\r\n Pulmonary edema was assessed by measuring lung wet\/dry weight ratio as previously described (22, 39) . In brief, the lobe of lung was cleaned and weighed to obtain the wet weight and was then placed in an oven at 75 8 C for 48 hours for the measurement of dry weight. The ratio of wet weight to dry weight was calculated.\r\n BAL was performed as described above, and total cell number was counted. For cell type differentiation, BAL smears were stained by the Diff-quick method (Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). Neutrophil counts are expressed as the percentage of neutrophils multiplied by the total number of cells in the BAL fluid sample.\r\n Lung tissue was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed for histologic analysis (hematoxylin and eosin) and immunohistochemistry. For immunohistochemistry of CXCL10, a rabbit anti-mouse CXCL10 polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems Inc.) was used. For immunofluorescence staining for CXCL10 and Ly6-G in lung tissues, approximately 5-mm-thick frozen lung sections were prepared from optimal cutting temperature compound-embedded lung tissues. Tissue sections were stained using goat anti-mouse CXCL10 Ab (R&D Systems, Inc.), anti-goat Alexa488 Ab (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), rat Ly6-G Ab (BD, San Jose, CA), and anti-rat Alexa 568 Ab (Invitrogen). For immunofluorescence staining for CXCR3 and Ly6-G in cells in BAL fluid, BAL smears were stained using biotinylated anti-mouse CXCR3 Ab (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), Alexa488 avidin Ab (Invitrogen), rat Ly6-G Ab (BD), and ant-rat Alexa 568 Ab (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst33342 (Invitrogen). Images were visualized using an A1Rsi confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).\r\n Lung tissue cells were prepared as previously described (22) . In brief, lung tissues were excised from mice and finely minced and the tissue pieces placed in medium containing 20 U\/ml collagenase and 1 mg\/ml DNase. After incubation, any remaining intact tissue was disrupted by passage through a 40-mm cell strainer. The digested cell suspension was then layered on 50% Ficoll, centrifuged at 400 3 g for 40 minutes, and the macrophage and neutrophil layers were collected.\r\n BM-derived neutrophils isolated from healthy WT mice were used as naive neutrophils (control). Mice were killed, and femurs from both hind legs were removed. The distal tip of each edge was cut off, and BM cells were isolated by flushing the femur with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cell pellets were resuspended and were then layered on 50% Ficoll, centrifuged at 400 3 g for 40 minutes, and the neutrophil layers were collected. The identification and purity of isolated bone marrowderived neutrophils, which were stained with Abs Ly6G and CD11b, were examined by flow cytometric analysis.\r\n BM neutrophils were isolated from WT and CXCL10 KO mice as described above. Isolated neutrophils (1 3 10 6 ) in 100 ml of media were injected intratracheally into CXCL10 KO mice. Thirty minutes after neutrophil transfer, recipient CXCL10 KO mice were subjected to acid aspiration-induced lung injury model as described above.\r\n Frozen lung tissues were homogenized in cell lysis buffer, and supernatants were assayed using specific ELISA kits to detect murine CXCL10 and CXCL2\/MIP-2 (R&D Systems, Inc.). Human plasma, lung lavage fluid, and culture supernatant in the human cells were assayed using specific ELISA kits for human CXCL10 and IL-8 (R&D Systems, Inc.). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was assayed as reported previously (22) . Briefly, lung tissues were homogenized and sonicated in 50 mmol\/L potassium phosphate buffer containing hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with potassium phosphate buffer containing the substrate, H 2 O 2 and o-dianisidine dihydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The enzymatic activity was determined spectrometrically, and values represent the change in OD\/min per gram tissue weight.\r\n The measurement of influenza virus NP or cellular RNA was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis with a protocol described. Briefly, RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from the DNA-free RNA, using Takara reverse-transcription reagents. Samples of firststrand cDNA were subjected to real-time PCR quantification (Thermal Cycler; Takara, Tokyo, Japan), using forward and reverse primers for the indicated RNA with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase or 18S as an invariant control. Relative amounts of mRNA were calculated by using the comparative threshold cycle (C T ) method.\r\n To examine CXCR3 expression, cells in BAL fluid or BM-derived naive neutrophils were stained with antibodies to CD11b, Ly6G, and CXCR3 (R&D Systems, Inc.), and CXCR3 levels in CD11b 1 Ly6G 1 cells were analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD). Data were analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Isotype controls were used for all the samples.\r\n Superoxide production was measured using an isoluminol assay in 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC) according to the manufacture's instruction. Cells in KRH (4 3 10 5 ) were incubated with 56 mM isoluminol (Tokyo Kasei Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) and 4.4 U\/ml horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) for 10 minutes at 37 8 C. N-Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) (10 mM) (or 40 nM phorbol myristate acetate) was then added to the reaction mixture via the injection port of the SpectraMax L Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and the light emission was recorded at fixed time intervals.\r\n BM neutrophils were isolated from WT mice as described above and were infected with influenza virus (PR8\/H1N1) (MOI \u00bc 3) or mock for 3 hours. Chemotaxis of the neutrophils toward CXCL2 was assayed using CytoSelect 96-well cell migration assay kit according to the manufacture's assay protocol (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA). Briefly, influenza virus-or mock-treated neutrophils were allowed to migrate toward CXCL2 (30 ng\/ml) for 1 hour in the presence or absence of CXCL10 (10 ng\/ml). Migratory cells were quantified by CyQuant GR Dye.\r\n All data are shown as mean 6 SEM. Measurements at single time points were analyzed by unpaired t test or analysis of variance with two-tailed t tests. Time courses were analyzed by repeated measurements (mixed model) analysis of variance with Bonferroni post t tests. Log-rank tests were performed on Kaplan-Meier survival curves. All statistical tests were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.00 program. P less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\r\n To examine the gene expression profile in nonviral lung injury, we performed a microarray analysis using an acid aspirationinduced lung injury model in rats that recapitulates the acute phase of human ARDS (20) . Intratracheal instillation of hydrochloric acid produced an increase in pulmonary elastance that represents changes in pressure achieved per unit changes in volume ( Figure 1a ) and decreased arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Pa O 2 ) at 3 hours (Figure 1b) . Pa CO 2 and mean arterial blood pressure remained relatively constant (see Figures E1a and E1b in the online supplement). Histological analysis revealed inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar hemorrhage, and hyaline membrane formation in acid-treated lungs at 3 hours (Figure 1c ). The number of neutrophils in lung lavage fluid was markedly elevated in the acid-treated animals at 3 hours (Figure 1d ). Total RNA was extracted from lung tissue in rats treated with acid (acid group) or rats without acid instillation (control group) and hybridized to Affymetrix rat RGUA34 GeneChips. Quantile normalization and differential expression was determined using R (Statistical Package for Microarray Analysis) in the Bioconductor package (21) . A total of 625 genes were significantly changed after acid aspiration for 3 hours. Figure E1c summarizes the genes that were up-regulated more than fivefold by acid aspiration-induced lung injury. CXCL10 was the most strongly up-regulated gene. Other cytokines\/chemokines, including IL-6, CXCL1 (KC), and CXCL2 (MIP-2), were also highly up-regulated in acid-treated lungs. Functional enrichment analysis identified cytokinecytokine receptor interaction and cytokine signaling as the top KEGG pathways overrepresented among differentially expressed genes after acid aspiration (Figure 1e) . Next, using a mouse model of acid aspiration-induced lung injury (22) , we confirmed the up-regulation of CXCL10 mRNA (Figure 1f , upper panel) and protein (Figure 1f , lower panel) in lungs by quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Acid aspiration resulted in rapid impairment of lung function in WT mice (Figures 2a and Figure 3a ) and histological changes with hemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration, and hyaline membrane formation (Figure 3b ). In addition, the mRNA for CXCL2 and IFN-b 1 were up-regulated in acid-treated lungs (Figure 1g ). Next, we determined whether these findings were relevant to patients with nonviral ARDS. Compared with control patients with extrapulmonary diseases, all patients with acute-phase ARDS of nonviral origin had high CXCL10 levels in both plasma and BAL fluid irrespective of ARDS etiology (four patients with sepsis, two with BM transplants, three with pneumonia, and one with multiple trauma) (Figure 1h ). These data indicate that CXCL10 is increased in the acute phase of nonviral ARDS. Figure E2a ). mRNA of virus NP protein from lungs increased after infection ( Figure  E2b ). At 1, 2, and 5 days after infection with influenza virus or mock controls, we measured tissue elastance (Figure 2a ) and airway elastance ( Figure E2c ) in mice, which represent the mechanical properties of the lung tissue and airways, respectively (23) . Pulmonary function becomes impaired over time in this viral infection model (Figure 2a and Figure E2c ). Histologically, inflammatory cells were increased on Day 2, and alveolar wall thickening, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and inflammatory cell infiltration were found on Day 5 after infection in the virusinfected lungs (Figure 2b ). Neutrophil numbers were markedly elevated in the virus-infected lungs on Day 5 (Figure 2c) . Thus, Figure E2d summarizes results showing the genes that were up-regulated more than fivefold after induction of lung injury, and again CXCL10 was the most strongly up-regulated gene. Pathway enrichment analysis identified enrichment for Toll-like receptor signaling and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction KEGG pathways among the genes that were found to be up-regulated in viralinduced lung injury (Figure 2d ). Up-regulation of CXCL10 mRNA in lungs of virus-treated mice was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 2e ). Similar to nonviral lung injury, mRNA expressions of CXCL2 and IFN-b 1 were upregulated in virus-treated lungs (Figure 2f ). These data indicate that CXCL10 is increased in the acute phase of viral lung injury\/ARDS.\r\n Next, we examined whether deletion of CXCL10 or its receptor, CXCR3, can control the severity of nonviral lung injury in mice. Acid aspiration resulted in rapid impairment of lung function in WT mice as demonstrated by increased pulmonary tissue elastance (Figure 3a) , edema formation as assessed by wet to dry weight ( Figure E3a) , and histological changes with hemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure 3b ). In comparison, CXCL10 KO mice exhibited better pulmonary function ( Figure 3a ) and less edema formation ( Figure E3a ) with fewer histological changes (Figure 3b ). CXCL10 deficiency also resulted in diminished pulmonary neutrophil sequestration as demonstrated by lower neutrophil counts in BAL fluid (Figure 3c ). MPO is a hemoprotein that is abundantly expressed in neutrophils and secreted during their activation, and thus MPO activity can be used as an indicator for neutrophil activation (24) . Compared with acid-treated WT mice, MPO activity was reduced in lungs of acid-treated CXCL10 KO mice (Figure 3d ). Production of CXCL2, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant ( Figure E3b ) was also reduced in lungs from acid-treated CXCL10 KO mice. Moreover, neutralization of CXCL10 with a specific antibody improved pulmonary function ( Figure E3c ) and decreased pulmonary edema formation ( Figure E3d ) and neutrophil infiltration into the lung ( Figure E3e ). Similar to CXCL10 KO mice, CXCR3 KO mice showed improved lung function (Figure 3e ) and histological changes (Figure 3f ) in the acid-treated lungs. Neutrophil counts in BAL fluid after acid treatment were less in CXCR3 KO mice compared with WT mice (Figure 3g ). Because type I IFNs were also up-regulated in the acid-treated lungs in WT mice (Figure 1h) , we next tested whether type I IFNs were involved in the pathogenesis of acid aspirationinduced lung injury using IFNAR1 KO mice. Changes in lung function after acid aspiration were comparable between IFNAR1 KO mice and WT mice (Figure 3h ). Neutrophil counts in BAL fluid after acid treatment were not different between CXCR3 KO mice and WT mice (Figure 3i) . These data suggest that type I IFNs are unlikely involved in the pathology of acid aspiration-induced lung injury in mice.\r\n Next, we determined whether deletion of CXCL10 or CXCR3 could control the severity of influenza virus-induced lung injury in mice. Using a live influenza virus (PR8\/H1N1) (Figure 2) , we tested whether CXCL10 or CXCR3 deficiency could improve the severity of influenza virus-induced lung injury. Compared with WT mice, CXCL10 KO (Figure 4a (Figure 4g) were not different between IFNAR1 KO and WT mice. These data indicate that deletion of CXCL10 or CXCR3, but not IFNAR1, markedly improved the severity of viral lung injury.\r\n To further determine the impact of CXCL10 deficiency on pulmonary inflammation independent of virus replication, we used an inactivated H5N1 influenza virus-mediated mouse lung injury model, as we previously described (22) . A bolus intratracheal instillation of inactivated H5N1 influenza virus caused rapid impairment of lung function (i.e., increased elastance [ Figure 4h ] and edema formation [ Figure E3e ]). CXCL10 KO mice treated with this virus showed improved elastance ( Figure 4h ) and histological signs of lung injury (Figure 4i) . In keeping with a protective effect, MPO activity (Figure 4j) , CXCL2 levels ( Figure E3f ), and pulmonary edema formation ( Figure E3g ) were decreased in CXCL10-deficient mice challenged with H5N1 virus. These data suggest that deletion of CXCL10 or CXCR3 improved the severity of influenza virus-induced lung injury most likely independent of virus replication.\r\n We then examined which cell types are responsible for CXCL10mediated lung injury. We conducted experiments using BM chimeras. Transfer of CXCL10 KO BM into WT mice or transfer of CXCL10 KO BM into CXCL10 KO recipients significantly improved lung functions ( Figure E4a ) and reduced pulmonary MPO activity ( Figure E4b ) and CXCL2 levels ( Figure E4c ) in an acid aspiration-induced lung injury model. Conversely, transfer of WT type BM into CXCL10 KO hosts markedly enhanced the severity of lung injury as compared with mice with CXCL10 mutations in BM cells (Figures E4a-E4c ). Of note, there was a significant difference in lung function between transfer of WT BM into CXCL10 KO mice and transfer of CXCL10 KO BM into WT mice. These data indicate that CXCL10 in hematopoietic cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, controls the severity of lung injury.\r\n Next we sought to identify which cell type(s) produce CXCL10 in lungs with lung injury\/ARDS. Using immunohistochemistry, we found abundant CXCL10-positive cells in the acidtreated lung at 3 hours (Figure 5a , right upper panel) and influenza virus-infected lungs 5 days after infection ( Figure  5a , right lower panel), most of which appeared to be macrophages and neutrophils. Moreover, CXCL10 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in neutrophils isolated from lungs of mice treated with acid for 3 hours (Figure 5b , left panel) or infected with influenza viruses for 5 days (Figure 5b , right panel) as a previous study had shown CXCL10 expression from polymorphonuclear neutrophils (25) . Macrophages isolated from acid-or virus-treated lungs also expressed CXCL10, but at a lower rate (Figure 5b) . These data suggest that CXCL10 was largely produced in fulminant phase of neutrophils but not by naive neutrophils in both nonviral and viral lung injury. Remarkably, other non-ELR motif CXC chemokines CXCL9 and IFN-b were largely produced in macrophages rather than neutrophils in injured lungs (Figure 5c ). In contrast, CXCL2 was largely produced by neutrophils in injured lungs ( Figure  5c ), as previously reported (5) .\r\n CXCL10 binds to CXCR3, a G-protein-coupled receptor, which is known to be expressed on activated T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and on some epithelial and endothelial cells. CXCR3 was previously believed not to be present on naive neutrophils (17) . However, recent studies have shown the expression of CXCR3 on neutrophils from patients with chronic lung disease but not in healthy control subjects (26) . Thus, we next tested whether CXCR3 was present on inflamed neutrophils in lungs with fulminant injury. CXCR3 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in neutrophils in lungs obtained from mice treated with acid for 3 hours (Figure 5d, upper panel) or influenza virus infection for 5 days (Figure 5d, lower panel) , whereas it was almost absent in naive neutrophils in lungs obtained from control mice (Figure 5d) . Also, CXCR3 protein was mapped to Ly6G-positive neutrophils in BAL cells obtained from influenza virus-infected mice (Figure 5e, lower panel) , but not BM-derived naive neutrophils (Figure 5e, upper panel) . Moreover, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that CXCR3 expression was higher in BAL neutrophils obtained from influenza virus infected-mice than BM-derived naive neutrophils (Figure 5f ).\r\n We previously demonstrated that the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-TRIF axis represents a common pathway responsible for lung injury (22) . We therefore investigated whether TRIF is involved in the induction of CXCR3 in inflamed neutrophils. As shown in Figure 5g , CXCR3 expression was induced in inflamed neutrophils isolated from virus-infected WT mice but was abolished in neutrophils isolated from virus-infected TRIF KO mice. Furthermore, CXCR3 expression by flow cytometric analysis was less in BAL neutrophils obtained from virus-infected TRIF KO mice than the virus-infected WT mice (Figure 5h) . These data suggest that the infiltrated neutrophils in lungs with ARDS, but not noninfiltrated naive neutrophils, express CXCR3 via the TRIF pathway. Our data indicate an induction of CXCL10 originating from neutrophils, and a unique neutrophil population expressing CXCR3, in fulminant lung injury, prompting us to examine a possible autocrine loop of CXCL10 and CXCR3 on neutrophils as described below.\r\n To test whether CXCL10-CXCR3 can activate neutrophils in an autocrine fashion, we examined the effect of CXCL10 on fMLP-induced oxidative burst in neutrophils isolated from acidtreated versus control lungs. We found that treatment with CXCL10 enhanced fMLP-induced superoxide generation in neutrophils isolated from the acid-treated (Figure 6a , right panel) but not from control (Figure 6a, left panel) lungs. Similar to oxidative burst (Figure 6a ), chemotaxis activity toward CXCL2 was enhanced by CXCL10 in neutrophils isolated from the acidtreated but not from control lungs (Figure 6b ). Such inflamed neutrophils expressed CXCR3 (Figures 5d-5h) . These data suggest that CXCL10 can enhance oxidative burst as well as chemotaxis in inflamed, but not in naive, neutrophils in an autocrine fashion during lung injury.\r\n Finally, to examine whether the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis on neutrophils can control the severity of lung injury in vivo, we performed neutrophil adoptive transfer experiment in mice. Neutrophils isolated from WT or CXCL10 KO mice were adoptively transferred into CXCL10 KO mice, and the mice were subjected to an acid aspiration-induced lung injury model. Compared with transfer of CXCL10 KO neutrophils into CXCL10 KO mice, transfer of WT neutrophils into CXCL10 KO mice significantly impaired pulmonary function assessed by pulmonary tissue elastance ( Figure 6c ) and total respiratory system elastance ( Figure  E5a ). Similarly, after acid aspiration, transfer of WT neutrophils into nontreated CXCR3 KO mice significantly impaired pulmonary function assessed by pulmonary tissue elastance ( Figure  6d ) and total respiratory system elastance ( Figure E5b ). These data suggest that CXCL10 and CXCR3 on inflamed neutrophils can participate in the pathogenesis of lung injury in vivo.\r\n CXCL10 belongs to the non-ELR CXC chemokine superfamily that lacks the normal Glu-Leu-Arg tripeptide sequence adjacent to the CXC motif. Non-ELR CXC chemokines were believed to be chemoattractant for T cells and NK cells but not neutrophils (8) (9) (10) . CXCL10 was reported to play a role in T-cell or NK-cell-mediated diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (27), asthma (28), allograft rejection (29) , and fibrosis (30-32). To our Figure 6 . Activation of oxidative burst and chemotaxis in inflamed neutrophils by CXCL10-CXCR3. (a) Superoxide generation in naive (left panel) and inflamed (right panel) neutrophils, isolated from lung tissues obtained from control and acid-treated mice, respectively. CXCL10 enhanced formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLP)-induced superoxide generation in inflamed, but not in naive neutrophils. Three independent experiments were done. (b) Chemotactic activity toward CXCL2 in neutrophils isolated from lung tissues obtained from control and acid-treated (lung injury) mice. CXCL10 enhanced the chemotaxis of acid-treated (lung injury), but not naive neutrophils. *P , 0.05 compared with acid-treated neutrophils without CXCL2 treatment. (c) Neutrophils were isolated from lungs obtained from wild-type (WT) or CXCL10 knockout (KO) mice at 3 hours after acid treatment. Isolated neutrophils (5 3 10 5 ) were intratracheally injected into the lungs of the CXCL10 KO mice, and the mice were subjected to an acid aspiration-induced lung injury model for 3 hours. Changes in tissue elastances after acid treatment of CXCL10 KO mice intratracheally transplanted with WT neutrophils (WT neu-trophils\u2192CXCL10 KO), and CXCL10 KO mice receiving CXCL10 KO neutrophils (CXCL10 KO neutrophils\u2192CXCL10 KO) were shown. n \u00bc 5 for each group. **P , 0.01 for the whole time course comparing WT neutrophils\u2192CXCL10 KO and CXCL10 KO neutrophils\u2192CXCL10 KO. (d) Neutrophils were isolated from lungs obtained from WT or CXCR3 KO mice at 3 hours after acid treatment. Isolated neutrophils (5 3 10 5 ) were intratracheally injected into the lungs of the CXCR3 KO mice, and the mice were subjected to an acid aspiration-induced lung injury model for 3 hours. Changes in tissue elastances after acid treatment of CXCR3 KO mice intratracheally transplanted with WT neutrophils (WT neutrophils\u2192CXCR3 KO), and CXCR3 KO mice receiving CXCR3 KO neutrophils (CXCR3 KO neutrophils\u2192CXCR3 KO) were shown. n \u00bc 5 for each group. **P , 0.01 for the whole time course comparing WT neutrophils\u2192CXCR3 KO, and CXCR3 KO neutrophils\u2192CXCR3 KO. (e) Scheme showing the postulated mechanisms by which CXCL10 is involved in neutrophil-mediated severe pulmonary inflammation. The scheme is based on the functional analysis reported in this paper. See DISCUSSION for details. Data in b-d are presented as mean 6 SEM.\r\n surprise, the increased levels of CXCL10 in lungs with lung injury originated to a large extent from infiltrated pulmonary neutrophils, which express a unique CXCR3 receptor. In addition, CXCL10-CXCR3 acts in an autocrine fashion on the oxidative burst and chemotaxis in the inflamed neutrophils, leading to fulminant pulmonary inflammation (Figure 6f) . Thus, apart from being a possible biomarker, CXCL10 appears to be a critical factor for the exacerbation, but not the initiation, of the inflammatory response and may thus be responsible for the untoward effects of inflammation that cause lung injury.\r\n We previously demonstrated that activation of the TLR4-TRIF pathway by damage-associated molecular patterns (33) derived from dying cells is a common signaling pathway responsible for the pathogenesis of lethal lung injury caused by multiple nonviral (i.e., acid aspiration) and viral (i.e., SARS, H5N1 influenza, anthrax) stimuli (22) . Interestingly, CXCL10 is a key chemokine downstream of the TLR4-TRIF pathway and is also produced in lungs stimulated with either TLR2-or TLR4receptor ligands (34) . Here we demonstrate that CXCL10 is critically involved in the pathogenesis of the acute phase of nonviral and viral lung injury\/ARDS. Also, we show a neutrophil population expressing CXCR3 receptors via TRIF in inflamed lungs and that loss of CXCR3 is associated with improved survival in response to influenza virus infection in mice. In accordance with these findings, a CXCR3 antagonist resulted in a mild reduction of disease symptoms in H5N1-infected ferrets (12) , and CXCR3-deficiency protected influenza-infected CCR5-deficient mice from mortality (35) .\r\n The clinical course and pathophysiological features of ARDS are marked by three phases: exudative (acute), proliferative (subacute), and fibrotic (late). Some patients with ARDS who survive the exudative phase enter a fibrotic phase that may require long-term ventilator support and\/or supplementary oxygen. The alveolar edema and inflammatory exudates of earlier phases are converted to extensive alveolar duct and interstitial fibrosis. CXCL10 (32) and CXCR3 (31) have been shown to attenuate bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice by interruption of angiogenesis (32) and fibroproliferation (31) . The data presented here and in similar studies imply that the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis may have a dual role in the acute (exudative) and chronic (fibrotic) lung processes.\r\n Current therapeutic strategies for the acute fulminant phase of human ARDS are limited. For example, treatments for H5N1 or pandemic H1N1 infection are restricted to vaccination or early treatment with antiviral agents such as oseltamivir. Although antiviral drugs may be of benefit if administered early in the disease, neither approach is very effective in rescuing patients who have already developed ARDS. Our data indicate that not only is CXCL10 production a bystander chemokine in severe respiratory failure but also CXCL10-CXCR3 can promote development of ARDS, whether the inciting factor is of viral or nonviral origin. Thus, the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis represents an interesting therapeutic target for treatment of patients during the acute phase of ARDS.\r\n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.","sha":"fbca93c87c12a3df083a6ba42fc357489b516753","publish_time":"2013-01-01","authors":"Ichikawa, Akihiko; Kuba, Keiji; Morita, Masayuki; Chida, Shinsuke; Tezuka, Hiroyuki; Hara, Hiromitsu; Sasaki, Takehiko; Ohteki, Toshiaki; Ranieri, V.

Patients infected by SARS coronavirus (6) or H5N1 avian influenza (7) who developed ARDS exhibited unusually high levels of C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), also known as IFN-g-induced protein 10 kD (IP-10), which binds the CXCR3 receptor, inducing chemotaxis, apoptosis, cell growth, and angiostasis (8, 9, 10) . We found that IFNAR1deficient mice were not protected from severe lung injury. Thus, the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis may be a prime therapeutic target in the treatment of the acute phase of ARDS of either nonviral or viral origin. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Turin, Italy). Aliquots (20 ml) were instilled and immediately reaspirated. The lavage fluid was diluted to a final volume of 50 ml and filtered through four layers of gauze to eliminate remaining mucus. Samples were stored in aliquots of 50 ml at 280 8 C until assayed. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). C57BL\/6 mice were bred at our animal facility. Mice were housed in accordance with institutional guidelines. After 3 hours of ventilation, left lungs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction, and right lungs were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for pathological examination. Control rats were sacrificed after surgical preparation without acid instillation. Total PEEP (PEEPt) and Pplateau pressure (Pplat) were measured at the end of expiratory and inspiratory occlusion, respectively. We used a previously described mouse acid aspiration-induced ARDS model (similar to the rat model described above) for the CXCL10 blockade study (22, 39) . Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (75 mg\/kg) and xylazine (20 mg\/kg) intraperitoneally, tracheostomized, and ventilated with flexiVent system (SCIREQ Inc., Montreal, Canada). After intratracheal instillation of HCl (pH \u00bc 1.5; 2 ml\/kg), followed by a VRM, mice were ventilated for 3 hours (FI O 2 , 1.0; PEEP, 2.5 cm H 2 O). Saline-treated groups served as controls. Right lungs were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histological examination. Mice were ventilated for 3 hours and analyzed as described above. The trachea was exposed by opening the neck skin and blunt dissection. was obtained from the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (Padova, Italy). Then, inactivated H5N1 virus particles (150 mg RNA) and controls (vehicle) were instilled intratracheally, followed by a VRM (35 cm H 2 O, 3 s). Every 30 minutes, airway elastance was calculated as (Pplat 2 PEEPt)\/VT. For TCID 50 assay, aliquots of culture supernatants or tissue lysates were 10-fold serially diluted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, applied in quadruplicate to 2 3 10 4 MDCK cells\/well of a 96-well plate, and incubated at 37 8 C for 1 hour. In brief, recipient mice were irradiated with 1,200 rads. In an acid-aspiration-induced ALI model in rats, total RNA was isolated from rat lung tissue at 3 hours by using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The analysis for differential gene expression of the Affymetrix RGU34a chips was performed using R packages from Bioconductor (21) . For KEGG pathway enrichment analysis we used DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (NIH). Blood samples were obtained from the left ventricle, and Pa O 2 was measured (Ciba-Corning Model 248; Bayer) to assess arterial blood oxygenation as an indicator for respiratory failure. BAL was performed as described above, and total cell number was counted. For immunofluorescence staining for CXCR3 and Ly6-G in cells in BAL fluid, BAL smears were stained using biotinylated anti-mouse CXCR3 Ab (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), Alexa488 avidin Ab (Invitrogen), rat Ly6-G Ab (BD), and ant-rat Alexa 568 Ab (Invitrogen). Images were visualized using an A1Rsi confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The digested cell suspension was then layered on 50% Ficoll, centrifuged at 400 3 g for 40 minutes, and the macrophage and neutrophil layers were collected. Mice were killed, and femurs from both hind legs were removed. Thirty minutes after neutrophil transfer, recipient CXCL10 KO mice were subjected to acid aspiration-induced lung injury model as described above. Frozen lung tissues were homogenized in cell lysis buffer, and supernatants were assayed using specific ELISA kits to detect murine CXCL10 and CXCL2\/MIP-2 (R&D Systems, Inc.). After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with potassium phosphate buffer containing the substrate, H 2 O 2 and o-dianisidine dihydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The enzymatic activity was determined spectrometrically, and values represent the change in OD\/min per gram tissue weight. Samples of firststrand cDNA were subjected to real-time PCR quantification (Thermal Cycler; Takara, Tokyo, Japan), using forward and reverse primers for the indicated RNA with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase or 18S as an invariant control. Isotype controls were used for all the samples. Migratory cells were quantified by CyQuant GR Dye. Time courses were analyzed by repeated measurements (mixed model) analysis of variance with Bonferroni post t tests. Log-rank tests were performed on Kaplan-Meier survival curves. P less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Pa CO 2 and mean arterial blood pressure remained relatively constant (see Figures E1a and E1b in the online supplement). A total of 625 genes were significantly changed after acid aspiration for 3 hours. CXCL10 was the most strongly up-regulated gene. Acid aspiration resulted in rapid impairment of lung function in WT mice (Figures 2a and Figure 3a ) and histological changes with hemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration, and hyaline membrane formation (Figure 3b ). At 1, 2, and 5 days after infection with influenza virus or mock controls, we measured tissue elastance (Figure 2a ) and airway elastance ( Figure E2c ) in mice, which represent the mechanical properties of the lung tissue and airways, respectively (23) . Similar to nonviral lung injury, mRNA expressions of CXCL2 and IFN-b 1 were upregulated in virus-treated lungs (Figure 2f ). Next, we examined whether deletion of CXCL10 or its receptor, CXCR3, can control the severity of nonviral lung injury in mice. Changes in lung function after acid aspiration were comparable between IFNAR1 KO mice and WT mice (Figure 3h ). Using a live influenza virus (PR8\/H1N1) (Figure 2) , we tested whether CXCL10 or CXCR3 deficiency could improve the severity of influenza virus-induced lung injury. We conducted experiments using BM chimeras. Transfer of CXCL10 KO BM into WT mice or transfer of CXCL10 KO BM into CXCL10 KO recipients significantly improved lung functions ( Figure E4a ) and reduced pulmonary MPO activity ( Figure E4b ) and CXCL2 levels ( Figure E4c ) in an acid aspiration-induced lung injury model. These data indicate that CXCL10 in hematopoietic cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, controls the severity of lung injury. Moreover, CXCL10 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in neutrophils isolated from lungs of mice treated with acid for 3 hours (Figure 5b , left panel) or infected with influenza viruses for 5 days (Figure 5b , right panel) as a previous study had shown CXCL10 expression from polymorphonuclear neutrophils (25) . Also, CXCR3 protein was mapped to Ly6G-positive neutrophils in BAL cells obtained from influenza virus-infected mice (Figure 5e, lower panel) , but not BM-derived naive neutrophils (Figure 5e, upper panel) . Our data indicate an induction of CXCL10 originating from neutrophils, and a unique neutrophil population expressing CXCR3, in fulminant lung injury, prompting us to examine a possible autocrine loop of CXCL10 and CXCR3 on neutrophils as described below. Three independent experiments were done. ( Isolated neutrophils (5 3 10 5 ) were intratracheally injected into the lungs of the CXCL10 KO mice, and the mice were subjected to an acid aspiration-induced lung injury model for 3 hours. P , 0.01 for the whole time course comparing WT neutrophils\u2192CXCL10 KO and CXCL10 KO neutrophils\u2192CXCL10 KO. ( d) Neutrophils were isolated from lungs obtained from WT or CXCR3 KO mice at 3 hours after acid treatment. Here we demonstrate that CXCL10 is critically involved in the pathogenesis of the acute phase of nonviral and viral lung injury\/ARDS. Some patients with ARDS who survive the exudative phase enter a fibrotic phase that may require long-term ventilator support and\/or supplementary oxygen. For example, treatments for H5N1 or pandemic H1N1 infection are restricted to vaccination or early treatment with antiviral agents such as oseltamivir.

The recent discovery of a counterregulatory axis of the renin angiotensin system composed of ACE2\/ Ang-(1-7)\/Mas has led us to examine the role of this vasoprotective axis on such disorders. Objectives: We hypothesized that Ang-(1-7) treatment would exert protective effects against PF and PH. Methods: Lentiviral packaged Ang-(1-7) fusion gene or ACE2 cDNA was intratracheally administered into the lungs of male Sprague Dawley rats. Two weeks after gene transfer, animals received bleomycin (2.5 mg\/kg). In a subsequent study, animals were administered monocrotaline (MCT, 50 mg\/kg). Measurements and Main Results: In the PF study, bleomycin administration resulted in a significant increase in right ventricular systolic pressure, which was associated with the development of right ventricular hypertrophy. The lungs of these animals also exhibited excessive collagen deposition, decreased expression of ACE and ACE2, increased mRNA levels for transforming growth factor b and other proinflammatory cytokines, and increased protein levels of the AT 1 R. Overexpression of Ang-(1-7) significantly prevented all the above-mentioned pathophysiological conditions. Similar protective effects were also obtained with ACE2 overexpression. In the PH study, rats injected with MCT developed elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular fibrosis, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, all of which were attenuated by Ang-(1-7) overexpression. Blockade of the Mas receptor abolished the beneficial effects of Ang-(1-7) against MCTinduced PH. Conclusions: Our observations demonstrate a cardiopulmonary protective role for the ACE2\/Ang-(1-7)\/Mas axis in the treatment of lung disorders.","text_body":"Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a fatal lung disease of unknown cause. The disease is characterized by progressive scarring of the lung tissue accompanied by fibroblast proliferation, excessive accumulation of matrix proteins, and abnormal alveolar structure, all leading to a loss of lung function and, ultimately, respiratory failure (1) . Current treatments with antiinflammatory, immunosuppressive, and antifibrotic agents have not shown promising results to abate the progression of the disease or to improve the quality of life (2) . Thus, it becomes essential to better understand the disease pathophysiology and identify novel therapeutic targets\/agents for the treatment of PF. There is experimental and clinical evidence to indicate that an activated pulmonary renin angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the pathophysiology of this disease (3, 4) : (1) Polymorphism of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene has been associated with the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (5); (2) AGT has been found to be one of the most overexpressed genes in patients with PF (6); (3) angiotensin II (Ang II) has been shown to stimulate cell growth and proliferation of lung fibroblasts (7, 8) ; (4) Ang II is known to up-regulate the expression of transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) (9), a central player in fibrogenesis; (5) Ang II-induced TGF-b generation is associated with the differentiation of fibroblast to myofibroblasts, which dramatically enhances extracellular matrix protein deposition (10); (6) Ang II is involved in lung inflammation through the generation of reactive oxygen species and the release of proinflammatory cytokines (11, 12) ; (7) Ang II has been shown to induce alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis (13) , which is believed to initiate the fibrotic process; and (8) Ang II is also involved in promoting procoagulatory effects by activating plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (14) .\r\n Another lung disease that is closely associated with an altered RAS is pulmonary hypertension (PH) (15) . Polymor-phism in the genes encoding for components of the RAS, such as AGT (16) , angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (16) , and the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) (17) , have been linked to the development of PH. Local production of Ang II by ACE stimulates the growth of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall to cause maladaptive changes and function of the pulmonary vasculature, which can result in the development of PH (18) .\r\n It is evident that modulation of components of the RAS appears to be a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung diseases such as PF and PH. However, direct targeting of the RAS components in these lung disorders using ACE inhibitors or AT 1 R blockers have produced mixed results in animal models and in humans (19, 20) . Nevertheless, the recent discovery of a homolog of ACE, called ACE2, and its enzymatic product angiotensin-(1-7) ([Ang- [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] ), offer an alternative pathway to regulate the intrapulmonary components of the RAS for producing beneficial effects. Ang-(1-7) is a heptapeptide that counteracts many of the detrimental effects of Ang II, including heart failure, kidney diseases, and diabetic complications (21, 22) . However, the role of Ang-(1-7) in pulmonary disorders, especially in PF and PH, has not yet been investigated. Because Ang-(1-7) is a peptide that undergoes rapid proteolytic degradation in the circulation (23), we decided to adopt a novel strategy of overexpressing this peptide locally in the lung tissue through a lentiviral-mediated gene delivery approach. Thus, in this study we propose that lentiviral-mediated pulmonary overexpression of Ang-(1-7) exerts cardiopulmonary beneficial effects against two experimental models of lung disorders: PF and PH. Some of the results of these studies have been previously reported in the form of abstracts (24) .\r\n Bleomycin sulfate was purchased from Calbiocem Labs (San Diego, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-b-actin antibody, monocrotaline (MCT), and a smooth muscle actin (clone 1A4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). AT 1 R rabbit polyclonal antibody and ACE rabbit polyclonal antibody were procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Alzet osmotic pumps (models 2004 and 2ML4) were purchased from Durect Corporation (Cupertino, CA). The Mas-receptor antagonist A-779 was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA).\r\n Five-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats were used in this study. All animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room (25 6 18C) and were maintained on a 12:12-hour light:dark cycle with free access to water and food. All procedures involving experimental animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Florida and complied with National Institutes of Health guidelines. For gene delivery into the lungs, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and a midline incision was made to expose the trachea. Empty virus (control), lenti-ACE2, or lenti-Ang-(1-7) viral particles (3 3 10 8 TU in 100 ml of phosphate-buffered saline) were injected into the trachea followed by 300 ml of air so as to enhance the spread of virus in the rat lung. Two weeks after lentiviral treatment, animals were subjected to bleomycin or monocrotaline administration.\r\n Animals under the influence of isoflurane anesthesia received a single intratracheal instillation of 2.5 mg\/kg dose of bleomycin sulfate in 300 ml of sterile saline. The 300-ml solution was instilled at end expiration, and the liquid was immediately followed by 200 ml of air to increase delivery to the distal airways. Control animals received an equal volume of sterile saline.\r\n PH was induced by single subcutaneous injection of MCT (50 mg\/kg). Control rats received saline (500 ml, subcutaneously). At the same time of MCT administration, a subset of animals were implanted with Alzet mini-osmotic pumps (model 2ML4) containing A-779, a Mas antagonist, at an infusion rate of 60 mg\/d (1 mg\/ml stock solution) for 28 days.\r\n Weekly systemic blood pressure was measured in conscious rats using the noninvasive tail-cuff method (Narco Bio-Systems, Austin, TX) as described elsewhere (25) . For measurement of right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), rats were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (30 mg\/kg, subcutaneously) and xylazine (6 mg\/kg, subcutaneously) and were placed in a supine position, breathing room air. The RVSP was measured using a silastic catheter inserted into the right descending jugular vein and forwarded to the RV. The data were recorded after stabilization of the tracing using a liquid pressure transducer, which was interfaced to a PowerLab (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO) signal transduction unit. The waveform was used to confirm the positioning of the catheter in the RV. Data were analyzed by using the Chart program supplied with the PowerLab system. After RVSP was measured, the rats were killed, and the hearts and lungs were harvested.\r\n Lung collagen deposition was estimated by measuring hydroxyl-proline content (26) . Briefly, frozen lung tissue was homogenized in 1.8 ml of glacial acetic acid (0.5 mol\/L) and dried in a speed vacuum. The dried sample was weighed, dissolved in 2 ml of 6 N HCl, and hydrolyzed at 1108C overnight. The acid hydrolysates and standards were applied to an ELISA plate along with citric\/acetate buffer and chloramine T solution. After 20 minutes, Ehrlich solution was added and incubated at 658C for 15 minutes. The reaction product was read at 550 nm. Solutions of 0 to 1,000 mg\/ml hydroxyproline (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were used to construct the standard curve.\r\n Data are presented as means 6 SEM. Statistical differences were evaluated by either one-way or two-way analysis of variance wherever applicable, followed by the Newman-Keuls test. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\r\n Production of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) lentiviral particles, determination of transduction efficiency of the lung by lentivirus, cardiac hypertrophy, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy are described in the online data supplement.\r\n Infection of cardiac myoblasts with 10 multiplicity of infection of lenti-Ang-(1-7) fusion protein resulted in a robust expression of IgG2b isotype ( Figure 1A ). Furthermore, in vivo experiments also demonstrated increased levels of Ang-(1-7) peptide in the lenti-Ang-(1-7) infected rat lungs compared with control animals ( Figure 1B ). These data establish that lenti-Ang-(1-7) is active and effective in secreting Ang-(1-7), and this secretion of Ang-(1-7) was present for 6 weeks after administration of the viral vector-containing transgene.\r\n As for lenti-ACE2 efficacy, murine ACE2 mRNA was detected only in the lungs of rats treated with lenti-ACE2, which we have also previously reported to occur in mice with tracheally induced lenti-ACE2 (27) . There was no murine ACE2 expression in the control animals (data not shown). Pathological score and hydroxyproline content of lung tissue after bleomycin administration. Lung sections from the different treatment groups were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and representative sections are shown in Figure 3A . Ashcroft scoring was determined from five different nonoverlapping fields from each lung section of different treatment groups as described previously (28) . The mean group results demonstrated a higher score for the bleomycin alone group compared with control animals, indicating a fibrotic response to bleomycin administration. However, animals treated with either lenti-ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) showed a significantly lower score, demonstrating a protective effect against the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis. These results are summarized in Figure 3B . Along similar lines, an increase in lung collagen accumulation, as assessed by measurement of lung hydroxyproline, was observed in the bleomycin alone group, which was significantly reduced with either ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) overexpression ( Figure 3C) .\r\n Effects of different treatments on the lung mRNA expressions of TGF-b and ACE2. Figure 4A demonstrates that the expres-sion of TGF-b was significantly elevated in the bleomycin group compared with those of normal lungs. TGF-b expression was significantly suppressed by either ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) overexpression. On the other hand, mRNA levels of endogenous ACE2, a membrane-bound enzyme, were significantly decreased in bleomycin-treated animals ( Figure 4B ). This decrease was completely prevented by overexpression of ACE2. Ang-(1-7) treatment resulted in an intermediate response in that these animals were not different from either control animals or the bleomycin-treated groups.\r\n Western analysis for comparative quantification of ACE and AT1R in the bleomycin study. Bleomycin administration significantly decreased ACE protein levels, and this decrease was prevented by overexpression with either ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) ( Figure 4C ). In contrast, bleomycin treatment resulted in a significant increase in lung AT1R protein as compared with control animals, and this increase was significantly attenuated by Ang-(1-7) overexpression, but not by ACE2 overexpression ( Figure 4D ).\r\n Prevention of MCT-induced PH and associated cardiopulmonary remodeling by Ang-(1-7). A single subcutaneous administration of MCT in rats resulted in robust increase in RVSP in 4 weeks (30.8 6 2.6 mm Hg in control vs. 67.5 6 7.3 mm Hg in MCT, P , 0.05, n 5 4-7; Figure 5A ). Overexpression of Ang-(1-7) significantly attenuated the MCT-induced elevation in RVSP (47 6 7 mm Hg, P , 0.05, n 5 9). MCT-challenged animals also developed RVH as measured by the right ventricle\/left ventricle 1 septum (RV\/LV1S) ratio (0.29 6 0.004 in control vs. 0.55 6 0.05 in MCT, P , 0.05, n 5 4-7) ( Figure 5B ), which likewise was prevented by overexpression of Ang-(1-7) (0.41 6 0.04, P , 0.05, n 5 9). Empty virus was without any effect on any parameters assessed. Furthermore, MCT treatment resulted in increase in the medial wall thickness, which also was significantly attenuated by Ang-(1-7) overexpression ( Figure  5C ). Rats treated with MCT exhibited increased interstitial right ventricular fibrosis as evaluated by percent fibrotic area Effect of Ang-(1-7) overexpression on MCT-induced lung RAS and inflammatory cytokines. Because cytokines have been shown to play a key role in the pathophysiology of PH, we evaluated the effects of Ang-(1-7) overexpression on inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Table 1 summarizes the quantitative measurement of mRNA for inflammatory cytokines in MCT and MCT 1 Ang-(1-7)-treated rats. MCT treatment resulted in significant increases in the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6). gp91phox, a subunit of the NADPH oxidase, tended to be increased by MCT treatment, but this increase was not statistically significant (Table 1) . Ang-(1-7) overexpression in the MCT-challenged rats resulted in a reversal of this pattern with decreased levels of TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, and gp91phox. In contrast, there was a significant increase in the antiinflammatory cytokine (IL-10) in MCT-treated rats overexpressing Ang-(1-7). Electron spin resonance spectroscopy revealed increased oxidative stress in the pulmonary artery and lungs of MCT-challenged animals, which was significantly attenuated by Ang-(1-7) overexpression ( Figure E3) .\r\n As for the lung RAS, the MCT treatment resulted in an increase in ACE mRNA levels that was significantly decreased by overexpression of Ang-(1-7) . The levels of ACE2 mRNA tended to increase with MCT treatment, possibly in a compensatory manner; however, this increase was significantly higher than control animals in the MCT 1 Ang-(1-7) group.\r\n The most significant finding of this study is that overexpression of ACE2, the enzyme that generates Ang-(1-7), or Ang-(1-7) itself, by targeted gene transfer protects the lungs from lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report beneficial effects of Ang-(1-7) against lung diseases using a novel lentiviral-mediated gene delivery approach. Ang-(1-7) is not a gene product but an enzymatic breakdown metabolite of Ang II. Here, we devised a synthetic gene for Ang-(1-7) and packaged it into a lentivirus.\r\n In the current study, endotracheal instillation of bleomycin evoked a severe fibrotic response, characterized by accumulation of interstitial lung collagen. Collagen deposition was significantly decreased by overexpression of ACE2 or Ang-(1-7). It has been reported that an increase in lung AT 1 R levels may considerably contribute to the fibrotic process as collagen-synthesis activity of the fibroblasts is enhanced in response to AT 1 R stimulation (8) . Lung AT 1 R was significantly increased after bleomycin administration, which was consistent with previous reports (29) . This effect of bleomycin was attenuated by pulmonary overexpression of Ang-(1-7). Down-regulation of AT 1 R by Ang-(1-7) has been reported in other tissues too (30) . However, no reduction in the lung AT 1 R protein level was observed in the ACE2 treatment group. We speculate that ACE2 overexpression may either inhibit components of the AT 1 R signaling pathway or stimulate the degradation of collagen, to bring about the beneficial antifibrotic effects. Lung protein analysis revealed decreased ACE levels in bleomycin-treated rats. Decreased pulmonary ACE activity associated with bleomycin injury has been reported in both animal and human studies (31) (32) (33) , which confirm our current findings.\r\n The mRNA levels of ACE2 were also significantly lower with bleomycin treatment, which is also in agreement with other published data (34) . Accordingly, the observed decreases in ACE and ACE2, which are predominantly expressed on the endothelial cells, may be attributed to endothelial injury. In fact, the endothelium has been identified as the primary site of injury after bleomycin toxicity (35) .\r\n TGF-b is an important cytokine that plays a key role in fibrogenesis (36) . Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated increased TGF-b levels with bleomycin treatment (37, 38) . In line with these studies, we also observed increased lung mRNA levels of this profibrotic cytokine after bleomycin instillation, which was significantly reduced by overexpression of both ACE2 and Ang-(1-7). We and others have demonstrated that Ang-(1-7) and ACE2 can reduce TGF-b levels in fibroblast cell culture experiments (39, 40) . Clinically, the presence of PH secondary to fibrotic lung diseases, called cor pulmonale, indicates poor prognosis with a compromised cardiac function. In our study, we did detect pulmonary hypertension and RVH after bleomycin administration. However, treatment with Ang-(1-7) prevented the development of both PH and RVH. Not only did we find protective effects with Ang-(1-7), but overexpression of ACE2 also conferred similar beneficial effects, possibly mediated via generation of Ang-(1-7). It is conceivable that the protective effects of ACE2 and Ang- (1-7) on the heart may be secondary to the reduction in the lung fibrosis. However, it is also possible that ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) may have direct effects on the heart. We have previously reported direct protective effects of ACE2 overexpression or Ang-(1-7) treatment against heart remodeling (26, 27) . Also, we have demonstrated that lentiviral administration of ACE2 in MCT-treated mice prevented the development of pulmonary hypertension and cardiac remodeling (41) . Likewise, similar findings were observed with a synthetic activator of the ACE2 enzyme in the MCT model of PH (42) . These collective results and the results of the current PF study demonstrating a beneficial effect of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) on pulmonary pressure encouraged us to perform a subsequent experiment to determine whether Ang-(1-7) overexpression would prevent the development of PH in the monocrotaline model.\r\n Four weeks of MCT treatment resulted in significant increase in RVSP, accompanied by cardiac remodeling in terms of development of RVH and fibrosis. Overexpression of Ang-(1-7), before induction of PH resulted in prevention of the elevated pressure and attenuation of the remodeling effects on the heart. By preventing RVH and fibrosis, Ang-(1-7) offers a cardioprotective role against pathobiology of PH. Structural changes in the pulmonary vasculature, characterized by medial wall thickening of the pulmonary arterioles, is a prominent feature of human PH. Thickening of the pulmonary arterioles increase pulmonary arterial resistance contributing to the elevated pressure (43) . MCT-challenged animals exhibited marked increase in the wall thickness of pulmonary resistant vessels and overexpression of Ang-(1-7) resulted in near-normal vessel morphology. It is likely that inhibition of vascular remodeling is a direct effect of Ang-(1-7), because previous findings have demonstrated antiproliferative properties of this peptide in vascular smooth muscle cells (30, 44) . Ang-(1-7) is believed to mediate its biological effects by interacting with the G protein-coupled receptor Mas (45) . Expression of Mas has been observed in the lung tissues (46) , and this receptor can be blocked using a specific and potent antagonist, A-779. Coadministration of A-779 abolished the beneficial effects of Ang-(1-7), strongly suggesting a protective role for the Ang-(1-7)\/Mas axis in PH. Increase in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines is a characteristic hallmark of PH (47) . In line with these findings, elevated lung mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines were observed in the MCT alone group. Overexpression of Ang-(1-7) appeared to prevent the increase in the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a) and produced an increase in the antiinflammatory cytokine (IL-10). We have recently demonstrated that XNT, an ACE2 activator, also increased lung IL-10 expression in the MCT model of PH (42) . This alteration of the inflammatory system by a peptide of the renin angiotensin system is of significance, as antiinflammatory therapy is currently being investigated for the treatment of PH. A recent report by Ito and colleagues (48) has shown that overexpression of IL-10 exerts beneficial effects against PH. One reason for the observed favorable changes in cytokine levels with Ang-(1-7) overexpression may be due to modulation of intrapulmonary RAS, which is known to be a potent regulator of cytokines and inflammation (49) . However, a direct effect of Ang-(1-7) on the immunomodulatory system may not be ruled out. Ang-(1-7) treatment prevented the MCT-induced increase in ACE mRNA levels, and significantly up-regulated ACE2 levels. It was unexpected to observe that ACE2 expression was increased by the overexpression of Ang-(1-7), although a similar increase in ACE2 expression was also observed with XNT treatment (42) . Also, cardiac-specific overexpression of Ang-(1-7) resulted in increased ACE2 levels in the heart (unpublished data). It is purely speculative that a positive feedback mechanism may be responsible for this observed phenomenon.\r\n Nevertheless, this explanation clearly warrants further evaluation. Lung overexpression of Ang-(1-7) did not adversely affect the basal systemic blood pressure. Clinically, this lack of effect on systemic blood pressure becomes more relevant because systemic hypotension could worsen prognosis in these patients with compromised cardiopulmonary functions (50) .\r\n Studies of Kuba and colleagues (51) demonstrated the beneficial role of ACE2 against acute lung injury, importantly against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-corona virus infections. Similarly, studies by Li and colleagues (34) showed that ACE2 is protective but is down-regulated in experimental and human lung fibrosis. Also, studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that overexpression of ACE2 (41) or its activation (42) prevented the development of PH and related cardiac pathophysiologies. The present study extends the findings of our earlier experiments and suggests that the beneficial effects of ACE2 overexpression\/activation are most likely mediated via generation of the Ang-(1-7) peptide, which in turn stimulates the Mas receptor to bring about protection. Taken together, previous and the current studies indicate that targeting of the pulmonary ACE2\/Ang-(1-7)\/Mas axis could provide novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of lung diseases, particularly involving pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. Because some of the findings suggest that ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) mediate their protective effects by different pathways, it appears that most effective therapeutic effect may be accomplished with a dual treatment regimen.\r\n We have demonstrated that Angiotensin-(1-7) has a cardiopulmonary protective role against recognized animal models of lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. Clinical trials of Ang-(1-7) are currently underway for treating cancer patients (52) , so the use of Ang-(1-7) as a new therapy for pulmonary diseases such as lung fibrosis\/hypertension might be plausible. The medical use of bleomycin as a tumor suppressant is limited due to induction of PF. Thus, it is possible to have a combination therapy with Ang-(1-7) to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of bleomycin by preventing the pulmonary toxicity.\r\n Author Disclosure: V.S. does not have a financial relationship with a commercial entity that has an interest in the subject of this manuscript.

Local production of Ang II by ACE stimulates the growth of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall to cause maladaptive changes and function of the pulmonary vasculature, which can result in the development of PH (18) . The Mas-receptor antagonist A-779 was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Five-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats were used in this study. All procedures involving experimental animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Florida and complied with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Empty virus (control), lenti-ACE2, or lenti-Ang-(1-7) viral particles (3 3 10 8 TU in 100 ml of phosphate-buffered saline) were injected into the trachea followed by 300 ml of air so as to enhance the spread of virus in the rat lung. Control animals received an equal volume of sterile saline. The RVSP was measured using a silastic catheter inserted into the right descending jugular vein and forwarded to the RV. The data were recorded after stabilization of the tracing using a liquid pressure transducer, which was interfaced to a PowerLab (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO) signal transduction unit. The waveform was used to confirm the positioning of the catheter in the RV. Lung collagen deposition was estimated by measuring hydroxyl-proline content (26) . Briefly, frozen lung tissue was homogenized in 1.8 ml of glacial acetic acid (0.5 mol\/L) and dried in a speed vacuum. The acid hydrolysates and standards were applied to an ELISA plate along with citric\/acetate buffer and chloramine T solution. Solutions of 0 to 1,000 mg\/ml hydroxyproline (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were used to construct the standard curve. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Pathological score and hydroxyproline content of lung tissue after bleomycin administration. The mean group results demonstrated a higher score for the bleomycin alone group compared with control animals, indicating a fibrotic response to bleomycin administration. These results are summarized in Figure 3B . Effects of different treatments on the lung mRNA expressions of TGF-b and ACE2. This decrease was completely prevented by overexpression of ACE2. In contrast, bleomycin treatment resulted in a significant increase in lung AT1R protein as compared with control animals, and this increase was significantly attenuated by Ang-(1-7) overexpression, but not by ACE2 overexpression ( Figure 4D ). Prevention of MCT-induced PH and associated cardiopulmonary remodeling by Ang-(1-7). A single subcutaneous administration of MCT in rats resulted in robust increase in RVSP in 4 weeks (30.8 6 2.6 mm Hg in control vs. 67.5 6 7.3 mm Hg in MCT, P , 0.05, n 5 4-7; Figure 5A ). Empty virus was without any effect on any parameters assessed. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy revealed increased oxidative stress in the pulmonary artery and lungs of MCT-challenged animals, which was significantly attenuated by Ang-(1-7) overexpression ( Figure E3) . The most significant finding of this study is that overexpression of ACE2, the enzyme that generates Ang-(1-7), or Ang-(1-7) itself, by targeted gene transfer protects the lungs from lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. It has been reported that an increase in lung AT 1 R levels may considerably contribute to the fibrotic process as collagen-synthesis activity of the fibroblasts is enhanced in response to AT 1 R stimulation (8) . Lung AT 1 R was significantly increased after bleomycin administration, which was consistent with previous reports (29) . This effect of bleomycin was attenuated by pulmonary overexpression of Ang-(1-7). Lung protein analysis revealed decreased ACE levels in bleomycin-treated rats. We and others have demonstrated that Ang-(1-7) and ACE2 can reduce TGF-b levels in fibroblast cell culture experiments (39, 40) . Clinically, the presence of PH secondary to fibrotic lung diseases, called cor pulmonale, indicates poor prognosis with a compromised cardiac function. It is conceivable that the protective effects of ACE2 and Ang- (1-7) on the heart may be secondary to the reduction in the lung fibrosis. Also, we have demonstrated that lentiviral administration of ACE2 in MCT-treated mice prevented the development of pulmonary hypertension and cardiac remodeling (41) . Overexpression of Ang-(1-7) appeared to prevent the increase in the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a) and produced an increase in the antiinflammatory cytokine (IL-10). This alteration of the inflammatory system by a peptide of the renin angiotensin system is of significance, as antiinflammatory therapy is currently being investigated for the treatment of PH. One reason for the observed favorable changes in cytokine levels with Ang-(1-7) overexpression may be due to modulation of intrapulmonary RAS, which is known to be a potent regulator of cytokines and inflammation (49) . Nevertheless, this explanation clearly warrants further evaluation. Lung overexpression of Ang-(1-7) did not adversely affect the basal systemic blood pressure. Taken together, previous and the current studies indicate that targeting of the pulmonary ACE2\/Ang-(1-7)\/Mas axis could provide novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of lung diseases, particularly involving pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. The medical use of bleomycin as a tumor suppressant is limited due to induction of PF.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia","abstract":"with the pathological structure of BPD, as seen in the lungs of preterm infants who died and in animal models (3, 7).\r\n As the authors note, this study was limited in that the subjects with BPD were stable outpatients younger than 3 years who did not require oxygen therapy at the time of the study. Whether their findings hold true in infants with persistent severe BPD, including those with chronic ventilator-dependent hypoxemic respiratory failure, is not clear. In addition, BPD classification was based on clinical decision making, rather than a physiologic assessment such as the oxygen reduction test (11).\r\n In an earlier article, members of this group studied DL CO and its components, DM and Vc, in full-term infants without lung disease and showed that DL CO and Vc (but not DM) correlated with the level of proangiogenic circulating hematopoietic stem\/progenitor cells (pCHSPCs) (12). However, this study did not include preterm infants with or without BPD. Both pCHSPCs, also referred to as circulating progenitor cells, as well as late-outgrowth endothelial colony-forming cells, are decreased in the cord blood of preterm infants who later develop moderate or severe BPD (13, 14) . Together, these findings suggest that early disruptions in the number and function of angiogenic progenitor cells, possibly by maternal complications of pregnancy known to be associated with BPD risk, may lead to impaired development of the pulmonary vasculature and sustained impaired gas exchange in preterm infants with BPD.\r\n This study shows how a physiologic assessment, such as infant pulmonary function testing, may be used in the clinical setting to provide an estimation of impaired gas exchange in preterm infants with varying degrees of lung injury. Combining functional assays such as this with measurement of pCHSPCs and other angiogenic biomarkers in the cord blood, as well as novel imaging techniques such as quantitative pulmonary magnetic resonance imaging (15), will lead to improved disease phenotyping of preterm infants at risk for BPD. Given the spectrum of disease severity among infants with severe BPD (as determined by the currently accepted diagnostic criteria), novel methods such as these will help identify preterm neonates more accurately, permit targeted therapies for the most severely affected infants, and provide quantitative evidence of the efficacy of these interventions in young children after preterm birth (16). n","text_body":"Rhinoviruses are ubiquitous respiratory pathogens that have coevolved with humans for millennia. Although historically associated with benign conditions such as the common cold, it is now appreciated that human rhinoviruses (HRVs) contribute to the pathogenicity of several major respiratory illnesses (1-7). Two recent surveillance studies identified HRV as the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in U.S. adults and the second most common in U.S. children (8, 9) . An extensive body of literature implicates HRV as a leading precipitant of asthma exacerbations, and mounting evidence suggests that recurrent HRV infection drives chronic airway remodeling and primary disease development in asthma (2) . HRV is also the leading viral precipitant of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and the most frequently isolated virus in patients admitted to intensive care units with severe lower respiratory tract infection (1, 6, 7) . The broad range of disease states associated with HRV may reflect a multifactorial contribution to pathogenesis involving clade-specific virulence, interactions with airway microbial communities, and the host immunologic response (7, 10, 11) . High-sensitivity molecular diagnostics have not only established a role for HRV in severe respiratory illness but also revealed that asymptomatic individuals can incidentally harbor HRV in their airways (12, 13) . This has led many clinicians to question the value of a positive HRV polymerase chain reaction assay, as detection of virus may not equate to clinical significance (13) . Given the wide spectrum of respiratory conditions and disease severity associated with HRV, this lack of clarity poses a significant diagnostic dilemma. There is a need for precision assays to delineate the significance of airway HRV and allow for efficient triage and patient care.\r\n In this issue of the Journal, Heinonen and colleagues (pp. 772-782) directly address this need by leveraging transcriptional profiling to define the molecular signature of symptomatic HRV infection and characterize the HRV-associated host response (14) . The authors identify a reproducible HRV-associated transcriptional signature in an otherwise healthy pediatric population that accurately predicts symptomatic infection when compared with healthy controls. This transcriptional signature endures across a spectrum of illness severity and includes gene expression alterations typical of the viral host response. They importantly go beyond the symptomatic versus healthy comparison to show that asymptomatic children with an HRV-positive polymerase chain reaction do not display the same host transcriptional response as symptomatic children.\r\n The authors were able to compensate for low participant numbers in the asymptomatic HRV group by using multiple analyses that capitalized on the high dimensionality of wholegenome profiling. More specifically, the asymptomatic host response was found to be more similar to the healthy than the symptomatic response, using cluster-based methods, pathway analyses, and differential expression of a metric that summarized transcriptional response. This work highlights the limitations of our current diagnostics in identifying HRV significance. Future work could focus on validating a signature that differentiates asymptomatic from symptomatic disease in the setting of a positive HRV polymerase chain reaction.\r\n The work by Heinonen and colleagues is a proof-of-concept study, and although it is of limited direct clinical applicability, it represents an important foundation for future work in complex populations with disproportionate severe HRV susceptibility (14) . This study focused on a generally healthy and limited population (,2 yr old, evaluated at four hospitals), using a cross-sectional design. One could argue that among the target population, clinical exam alone could identify symptomatic individuals, but by defining the host transcriptional response of true symptomatic HRV infection in a study population with few confounding variables, the authors lay the groundwork for subsequent studies in more complex populations, where HRV confers significant disease burden.\r\n With this in mind, patients with underlying immune compromise would be a key target population for future studies. Substantial infection may present atypically in this growing demographic, which is disproportionately susceptible to severe HRV-mediated disease and complications such as secondary bacterial infections (4) . Longitudinal studies will also be essential. If prognostic transcriptional biomarkers identify who will develop severe infection early, this could have important implications for triage and treatment, especially as new antivirals currently in clinical trials become available (6) .\r\n Another area in which an HRV-specific transcriptional signature may prove useful is in the setting of bacterial coinfection, a well-described complication of primary HRV disease (4, 7, 11 ). An HRV-specific signature that rules out bacterial coinfection would allow for more targeted treatments that reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. Furthermore, transcriptional profiling holds promise for overcoming the limitations of current respiratory infection diagnostics, which are unable to identify causative pathogens in the majority of cases (8, 9, 13) .\r\n The transcriptional signature of HRV infection may also serve as a tool for investigating mechanisms of pathogenesis. Although blood provides a straightforward and relatively noninvasive medium for analysis, respiratory fluids (e.g., sputum, tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage) would likely provide a more accurate reflection of host response at the site of active infection. Transcriptional analyses that incorporate a metagenomic deep sequencing (MDS) platform may be particularly valuable for such studies (15) , as they allow for simultaneous high-throughput analyses of host and microbial transcripts as well as RNA viral genomes.\r\n MDS has other advantages, including that it provides an opportunity to identify causative pathogens without a need for culture. Unlike microarrays (a probe-based technology), MDS is not limited to studying prespecified transcripts, and thus could even identify novel pathogens. In addition, this approach could aid in understanding the molecular basis for the disproportionately severe outcomes associated with HRV clades A and C, which our current diagnostics do not distinguish (2, 5, 10) . MDS also captures commensal microbial community structure and could identify ecological changes that signal outgrowth of colonizing bacterial pathogens in the setting of an otherwise mild HRV infection. This could lead to early identification of bacterial coinfections and allow for pathogen-targeted interventions in advance of clinical deterioration.\r\n HRVs are among the most frequently encountered and clinically significant viral pathogens in adults and children. Although most often associated with innocuous conditions, HRV can also induce severe infection and precipitate exacerbations of chronic airway diseases. Here, Heinonen and colleagues leverage an innovative approach to evaluate differential host transcriptional responses that occur in patients with asymptomatic versus pernicious HRV infection (14) . This work provides a platform for both mechanistic studies of host-microbe interactions in pulmonary illness and future clinical studies of HRV infection in medically complex populations. n","sha":"afb356ea2810907cb2e21e06b1679ca7d9b6a6f5","publish_time":"2016-04-01","authors":"Langelier, Charles; Christenson, Stephanie A.","journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","doi":"10.1164\/rccm.201511-2272ed","Title":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","H index":343.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Rhinoviruses are ubiquitous respiratory pathogens that have coevolved with humans for millennia.

We discuss one of the fundamental mechanisms of protein homeostasis, the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), as it relates to lung disease. The UPS effects selective degradation of ubiquitinated target proteins via ubiquitin ligase activity. Important pathobiological mechanisms relating to the UPS and lung disease have been the focus of research, with inappropriate cellular proteolysis now a validated therapeutic target. We review the contributions of this system in various lung diseases, and discuss the exciting area of UPS-targeting drug development for pulmonary disease.","text_body":"Normal pulmonary physiology can be disrupted by direct contact with the environment, exposure to potentially noxious inhalants, and infection with ensuing inflammatory cell activation. This delicate balance from normal homeostasis is tipped toward inflammatory injury in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury (ALI), and pneumonia. Insights into the molecular pathophysiology of these diseases have greatly increased. In this review, we highlight emerging discoveries regarding selective regulation of protein degradation in the lung by the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system (UPS), and how this regulation at the protein level affects critical functions of lung cells with ramifications that can maintain or threaten the vitality of the organism.\r\n Maintenance of any healthy tissue requires stringent quality control at the protein level. All cellular proteins undergo tightly regulated turnover in the cell to prevent improper activity or unnecessary accumulation of dysfunctional proteins. Protein degradation also changes critical cellular protein concentrations in response to chemical signals or for important cellular events such as mitosis. Major protein regulatory systems include the autophagic\/lysosomal pathways and the more prevalent UPS (1) . Ubiquitin covalently interacts with other proteins whereby a single ubiquitin attaches to one lysine (monoubiquitination) or to multiple lysine residues on the target (multimonoubiquitination), or a ubiquitin chain can be produced at a single lysine residue (polyubiquitination). Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues, which results in eight different interubiquitin linkage types, in turn leading to binding sites for other ubiquitin molecules and distinct branched ubiquitin chains that determine function. Substrate ubiquitination occurs in an ATP-dependent fashion, through an elaborate enzymatic cascade that adds the ubiquitin protein to, first, a ubiquitinactivating enzyme (E1), and then to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and last to a specific target protein, a critical event that is catalyzed by a ubiquitin E3 ligase. One or more Ub molecules are thus added to the substrate, with monoubiquitination usually tagging the substrate for endocytic sorting, whereas polyubiquitination tags the substrate for recognition by the proteasome, often resulting in target protein degradation by the 26S proteasome protein complex, which is composed of one 20S and two 19S proteolytic subunits (2) (Figure 1 ). Overall, this process consumes large amounts of cellular energy, is represented by the largest family of enzymes present in eukaryotes, and accounts for about 5% of the genome. Given the physiological importance of the UPS system to cellular and tissue physiology, failure of the UPS is only rarely seen, but some mutations in proteins identified as UPS E3 ligases result in human familial diseases including Angelman syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and von Hippel-Lindau (vHL) syndrome (3), and changes in UPS function have been implicated in disorders of the cardiovascular (4), neurological (5), and pulmonary (6) systems.\r\n The system is hierarchical, with one or two E1 enzymes described in mammalian cells, about 40 E2 enzymes, and more than 1,000 E3 ligases described. The targeting, ubiquitination, and degradation of proteins occur in a highly regulated and specific manner, with the E3 ligase usually binding target proteins with some post-translational modification that harbors a specific structural motif, termed a \"degron\" (7) . Two major families of E3 ligases orchestrate ubiquitin addition to target proteins and ultimately determine substantial shifts in cellular behavior. The RING (really interesting new gene) finger and RING-related proteins comprise the largest E3 family, whose members function either independently as monomers or dimers, or in a multisubunit complex to ubiquitinate a broad range of substrates. The HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxy terminus) domain-containing proteins are a smaller E3 ligase family whose members are important for regulating many proteins, some of which include the transmembrane surface proteins. There is also a family of \"Ubox\" E3 ligases, which do not have enzymatic activity and mostly bridge catalytically active E2 enzymes, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to the target protein. The linear ubiquitination complex (LUBAC) is another multisubunit E3 ligase that polyubiquitinates substrates for sorting and\/or degradation by adduction of chains of Ub monomers joined end-to-end (8) . LUBAC contains three important components: HOIL-1L (heme-oxidized IRP2 [ironresponsive element-binding protein-2] ubiquitin ligase-1), HOIP (HOIL-1-interacting protein), and SHARPIN (SHANK [SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains-2]-associated RH [RBCK1 homology] domain-3-interacting protein). The E3 ligases are diverse, represented by hundreds of genes in humans, and are highly represented in all eukaryotes (9) .\r\n Among RING E3 multisubunit ligases, the Cullin-RING family and anaphase-promoting complex\/cyclosome (APC\/C) are the best characterized. The largest family of Cullin-RING E3 ligases is the Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein (SCF) family, a canonical multimodule E3 ubiquitination complex often causing target proteasomal degradation. The F-box proteins (FBPs) are interchangeable and confer substrate specificity through recognition of post-translationally modified degron motifs within substrates via target-binding domains, and tether substrate proteins to the Cullin protein of the SCF complex via Fbox domains (10) . Each FBP causes degradation of a specific set of target proteins by unique degron recognition. Sixtyeight FBPs have been identified in humans, designated FBXL (containing a leucine-rich domain), FBXW (containing a WD-40 domain), or FBXO (containing neither leucine-rich nor WD-40 domains) (11) . Overall, only a small fraction of FBP biology is known, and multiple laboratories are describing the diverse and critical activities of FBPs in physiology and disease.\r\n One example of E3 ligase molecular regulation related to respiration is the oxygen-sensing role of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a, a stress response transcriptional activator of chemokines, growth factors, and proteases. In normoxia, HIF-1a is hydroxylated through the action of prolyl hydroxylase domain protein-2 (PHD2), using oxygen as substrate, and the hydroxylated HIF-1a is bound by the vHL protein, which recruits a ubiquitin ligase for HIF-1a polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (12) . During hypoxia, however, PHD2 activity (and therefore HIF-1a hydroxylation) is decreased, and vHL no longer prevents HIF-1a activation of transcription. Such molecular oxygen sensing is important for normal embryonic development and growth but is a major pathway \"hijacked\" by cancer cells with limited local oxygen supply to stabilize HIF-1a and augment local tumor growth and metastatic potential (13) . In translational biomedical research, the vHL protein and HIF-1a signaling axis was described initially in vHL disease, caused by ineffective vHL; affected patients have polycythemia, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and respiratory insufficiency, attributed to increased HIF-1a signaling. Figure 1 . Schematic of the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system. Protein degradation is a regulated, multistep process. Ubiquitin is loaded onto an E1 activating enzyme in an ATPdependent fashion, and then transferred to an E2 conjugating enzyme. The same E2 can bind many E3 ligases, which in turn can ubiquitinate several target substrate proteins. E3 ligases bind specific substrate proteins based on substrate degron motifs usually consisting of a post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation. Adduction via the K48 residue on Ub tags the substrate for sorting, lysosomal destruction, or proteolytic cleavage and degradation by the 26S ubiquitin proteasome. Linear ubiquitination via the M1 residue by the linear ubiquitination complex (LUBAC) (HOIL-1L, HOIP, and SHARPIN) changes the cellular localization and activity of substrates, including RIP and NEMO for NF-kB signaling.

The proteasome becomes more specialized in the setting of infection or inflammation. For example, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or IFN release from proinflammatory cells leads to the conversion of 19S elements in the proteasomal machinery to form an \"immunoproteasome,\" which generates peptides that are trafficked preferentially through antigen-processing machinery and ultimately to the type I major histocompatibility complex to be presented to T lymphocytes that bolster immunity to pathogens (14) .\r\n Studies demonstrate the presence of proteasomes outside the cellular environment, such as lung alveolar fluid. Proteasomes in lung fluid are only shown to have the 20S subunit and cleave proteins without requirement for E3 ligases for protein-specific recognition or ubiquitination. It has been proposed that extracellular proteasomes are a consequence of cell lysis and spillage of cellular contents; alternatively, there may be packaging and exocytosis (i.e., active secretion) of intact 20S proteasomes. Regardless of the mechanisms of release, extracellular proteasomes are increased in the setting of acute infection and inflammation, and Definition of abbreviations: ALI \u00bc acute lung injury; C-CBL \u00bc C-casitas B-lineage lymphoma E3 ligase; CCT \u00bc CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase; CF \u00bc cystic fibrosis; CFTR \u00bc cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator; CHIP \u00bc C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein; COPD \u00bc chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ENaC \u00bc epithelial sodium channel; FBXL, FBXW, FBXO \u00bc F-box protein containing a leucine-rich domain, a WD-40 domain, or neither a leucine-rich nor WD-40 domain, respectively; HDAC2 \u00bc histone deacetylase-2; HIF-1a \u00bc hypoxia-inducible factor-1a; HOIL \u00bc heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase-1; IkB \u00bc inhibitor of NF-kB; IL-33R \u00bc IL-33 receptor; ILD \u00bc interstitial lung disease; KO \u00bc knockout; LPCAT1 \u00bc lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase-1; Lpp2082 \u00bc Legionella pneumophila (strain Paris) F-box protein; MID1 \u00bc E3 ubiquitin ligase midline-1; MuRF1 \u00bc muscle RING finger-1; NEDD \u00bc neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein; NF-kB \u00bc nuclear factor-kB; ParvB \u00bc parvin B; PKC \u00bc protein kinase C; PLC \u00bc phospholipase C; RLIM \u00bc RING finger LIM domain-binding protein; RMA1 \u00bc RING finger protein with membrane anchor-1; SKP2 \u00bc S-phase kinase-associated protein-2; SNP \u00bc single-nucleotide polymorphism; SP-C \u00bc surfactant protein C; Th2 \u00bc helper T-cell type 2; TNF \u00bc tumor necrosis factor; TRAF \u00bc TNF receptor-associated factor; UPS \u00bc ubiquitin proteasome system; vHL \u00bc von Hippel-Lindau protein; WT \u00bc wild type.\r\n * Legionella bacteria-derived F-box protein.\r\n y Adenovirus-derived E3 ligase. z Part of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein) multisubunit Cullin-RING E3 ligase.\r\n x Specific mechanism not fully characterized in lung disease.\r\n may play a role in antigen presentation to activate immunity against extracellular microbes the host encounters (15) . Proteasome dysregulation as a microbial pathogenic mechanism. Pathogens can exploit host cell UPS machinery to their advantage. For example, Legionella pneumophila bacteria produce their own FBP, Lpp2082, which is required for infection. This FBP binds and competes the substrate ParvB away from degradation, apparently creating a permissive cellular environment (16) . Human adenovirus creates two E3 ligase proteins that cause degradation of the p53 protein, allowing production of viral proteins and genetic material without p53-mediated host cell apoptosis (17) . Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes a toxin, Cif, in vesicles that increases ubiquitination and degradation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) (18) , thus making the airway secretions more tenacious. The coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome possesses a Ub-like protein that increases pathogenicity; also, proteasome inhibitor pretreatment reduced viral replication and improved survival in mice (19) , implicating some role for the UPS in severe acute respiratory syndrome.\r\n Cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is due to insufficient CFTR cell surface expression, causing impaired chloride secretion in the airway lumen, with reduced airway surface liquid, conglomeration of proteins, impaired ciliary clearance, and enhanced susceptibility to infection. Cystic fibrosis is most commonly due to CFTR mutation at the position 508 phenylalanine residue (DF508); this mutant protein is translated, but intercepted in the endoplasmic reticulum by E3 ligases CHIP and RMA1, ubiquitinated, and degraded by the proteasome before reaching the cell surface (20) . C-terminal CFTR deletions are processed normally, but rapidly shuttled to the proteasome for degradation (21) , while normal CFTR membrane expression is regulated by E3 ligase C-CBL, mediating ubiquitination and endosomal internalization (22) .\r\n Pulmonary edema. In pulmonary edema, epithelial sodium channel activity regulates apical Na 1 entry into the cell, from where it is actively transported out of the cell via the Na-K-ATPase as the critical mechanism for fluid balance in the lungs (23) . In addition to its regulation of HIF-1a protein concentrations discussed previously, vHL protein also controls edema clearance during hypoxia, where it mediates degradation of Na-K-ATPase (24) . Here, it appears that reactive oxygen species participate in the regulation of the Na-K-ATPase via PKCz and a member of the LUBAC, HOIL-1L, which leads to impaired lung fluid clearance. Thus, the steady state of both the epithelial sodium channel and Na-K-ATPase are highly regulated by the UPS to critically maintain epithelial function to effect lung fluid balance and normal breathing.\r\n Perhaps the most prominently implicated signal in pulmonary inflammation is the activity of the nuclear factor of k light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells, NF-kB (25) . When active, this transcription factor master regulator of inflammation leads to expression of cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteases, and leukocyte growth factors, among others. The negative regulator of NF-kB is IkB, which usually binds and sequesters NF-kB in the cytosol (26) . IkB is degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome via the FBP b-transducin repeatcontaining protein (b-Trcp, now designated FBXW1). When IkB is phosphorylated, it is recognized by SCF FBXW1 for ubiquitination and degradation, leaving NF-kB unrestricted to initiate the inflammatory cascade. IkB phosphorylation is in turn regulated by kinases, which are each activated by ligation of receptors, or the activity of protein second messengers, such as the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins.\r\n LUBAC has been described to have an important role in regulating inflammation (27) . LUBAC is now known to be part of the TNF receptor signaling complex and participates in signaling processes by end-to-end polyubiquitination of TNF receptor signal modulators RIP1 and NEMO, apparently increasing signal transduction by this particular ubiquitination scheme (28) . LUBAC also targets IL-1b, CD40 ligand, and several Toll-like receptors (TLRs). SHARPIN mutant mice develop a proliferative dermatitis, and patients with mutations of HOIL-1L and thus LUBAC deficiency have protracted inflammatory disorders and invasive bacterial infections (29) .\r\n Studies indicate that TRAF proteins are targets of the SCF FBXL2 E3 ligase (30) . TRAF degradation after overexpression of FBXL2 globally suppresses inflammatory responses in response to endotoxin. Interestingly, another E3 ligase, SCF FBXO3 , targets FBXL2 for its degradation; FBXO3 depletion in cells increases FBXL2 and decreases TRAF protein levels, blunting inflammatory cytokine release in vitro. A human FBXO3 polymorphism with a relatively high (z6%) frequency among individuals of European descent exists, and this mutant FBXO3 decreases FBXL2 ubiquitination; humans with this polymorphism hospitalized with sepsis have lower serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (30) .\r\n The E3 ligase Itch causes degradation of multiple inflammatory transcription factors and signaling molecules (31) , and Itch mutations in mice cause multiorgan inflammatory disease with pulmonary interstitial inflammation (32) . A 2010 study of an Amish family with a multiorgan inflammatory-autoimmune syndrome characterized by severe pneumonitis and premature death identified an autosomal recessive mutation in the Itch E3 ligase (33) , almost completely recapitulating the disease phenotype initially observed in knockout mice. Miz1 appears to have checkpoint function in the regulation of LPS-induced inflammation where the cytoplasmic Miz1 suppresses LPS-or TNF-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines through inhibition of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activation (34) . It has been reported that the HECT domain-containing E3 ligase Mule catalyzes TNF-ainduced Miz1 K48-ubiquitination degradation, which is of importance in TNF-a-induced JNK activation and cell death (35) . Interestingly, the interaction between Mule and Miz1 occurred TNF-a independently of the pox virus and zinc finger domain of Miz1, which is of potential relevance in the inflammatory pathways during pulmonary infections.\r\n Asthma. In allergic asthma, an antigen-specific hyperactive helper T-cell type 2 (Th2) immune response causes airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness. Bronchodilators or immunomodulators including steroids represent the initial therapy, with allergen-specific immunotherapy used to promote immunological tolerance and durable symptom relief. Immune tolerance is mediated, in part, by the Ub E3 ligase Itch, which degrades the phosphorylated JunB, a Th2-specific transcription factor. Itch deficiency causes high JunB levels with increased production of the Th2 cytokines (36) . In asthma animal models, Itch knockout mice fail to develop tolerance to ovalbumin antigen-specific immunomodulatory therapy. Likewise, in another ovalbumininduced asthma study of mice lacking the E3 ligase Cbl-b, immune tolerance was disrupted, although with increased airway neutrophils and Th1 cytokines IL-12 and IFN-g (37) . Itch and Cbl-b therefore each seem to play a role in maintaining immune tolerance in different effector arms of the T-cell system. Another E3 ligase, Midline 1 (MID1), is up-regulated after antigen stimulation with the common asthma allergen house dust mite (38) . MID1 targets protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A), an endogenous inhibitor of cytokine signaling that deactivates NF-kB; hence small inhibitory RNA MID1 knockdown suppressed allergic inflammation in vivo in mice and in vitro in human lung cells.\r\n COPD. With tobacco exposure, some smokers have a sustained inflammatory phenotype, and many develop COPD. UPS activity is dysregulated in this setting, with increased UPS components (39) and impairment of proteasome activity after cigarette smoke administration (40, 41) . The epigenetic regulator, histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2), is degraded by the UPS after cigarette smoke exposure secondary to HDAC2 phosphorylation (42) . Although the E3 ligase RING finger LIM domain-binding protein has been shown to target HDAC2 in other systems (43) , its role in the lung has not been described; regardless, loss of HDAC2 causes aberrant inflammatory gene transcription and feed-forward inflammation in some smokers, with HDAC2 levels correlating inversely with COPD severity (44) .\r\n In ALI, many physiological changes involve the UPS (45) . TLRs sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns and initiate inflammatory responses. E3 ligase Cbl-b down-regulates TLR signaling, with Cbl-b deficiency potentiating the inflammatory response (46) . IL-33 is a strong inflammatory activator during asthma and ALI through the receptor ST2L. Phosphorylated ST2 is bound and ubiquitinated by SCF FBXL19 , causing UPS degradation. Ectopically expressed FBXL19 decreased ST2 and reduced inflammation while improving survival in animal models of ALI (47) . In other work, depletion of the proinflammatory FBP FBXO3, which targets the TRAF inhibitor FBXL2 for its disposal, restores FBXL2 protein levels, improves survival, lowers cytokine release, and lessens inflammation histologically in mice in a Pseudomonas and LPS model of ARDS (30) .\r\n In severe ARDS and COPD, diaphragmatic and peripheral muscle wasting are common (48) . In a mouse ALI model displaying comorbid muscle wasting the E3 ligase muscle RING finger-1 (MuRF1) mediates muscle breakdown as MuRF1 knockdown prevented ALI-associated muscle wasting (49) .\r\n Many components within the UPS participate in neoplastic processes, including cancer-promoting FBPs b-Trcp (FBXW1) and SKP2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein-2; also known as FBXL1) (50) . b-Trcp disinhibits inflammatory NF-kB activity, causing expression of cell-activating cytokines, growth factors, and proteases that augment tumor proliferation and invasion. b-Trcp also targets the b-catenin protein, which mediates cell differentiation through the Wnt signaling pathway. Loss of b-catenin could impair cell differentiation, typical of aggressive malignancies (51) . FBXW7, however, is a p53-dependent tumor suppressor that facilitates degradation of oncoproteins (52) . FBXL2 destabilizes proteins critical to cell cycle progression, thereby inhibiting lung tumor cell growth (53) (54) (55) .\r\n In lung cancer, SKP2 is considered a proneoplastic factor that degrades protective p27 and increases tissue invasiveness (56) . Studies show that increased SKP2 protein levels in biopsy specimens are associated with increased metastasis. Moreover, decreased p27 in SKP2 hi specimens is robustly correlated with shorter survival (57, 58) .\r\n Pulmonary surfactant is composed of key surfactant-associated proteins and phospholipids, the components of which participate in the innate immune response and maintenance of alveolar stability by lowering surface tension. Mutations of the surfactant protein C (SP-C) gene have been associated with a familial form of usual interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis (59, 60) . SP-C processing and cell secretion require distinct steps, including ubiquitination by the E3 ligase NEDD4-2 (61, 62); many familial ILD-associated SP-C alleles involve the C terminus of the protein, with ubiquitinated and aggregated SP-C within perinuclear inclusions of one such mutation (63) , demonstrating defective trafficking after E3 ligase association.\r\n CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCTa) is an essential lipogenic enzyme needed for surfactant phospholipid synthesis. CCTa ubiquitination is catalyzed by the SCF FBXL2 E3 ligase complex (64) , and FBXL2 depletion stabilizes CCTa levels and stimulates surfactant biosynthesis. Another surfactant enzyme, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT1), is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by b-Trcp (65) . Thus, it is likely that the Ub E3 ligases regulate surfactant components to modulate lung homeostasis.\r\n The first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug that targets the proteasome is bortezomib (Velcade), a reversible 20S proteasome inhibitor. Bortezomib has emerged as an effective agent in the treatment of multiple myeloma, a malignancy previously linked with a dismal prognosis (66, 67) . Only one other proteasome inhibitor has been approved by the FDA for use in humans, carfilzomib, as second-line therapy for multiple myeloma and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r\n The success of bortezomib has established the proteasome as a viable target in the current era of drug development, with reports on five \"second-generation\" proteasome inhibitors that target overlapping aspects of cell signaling in vitro. The preclinical and in vivo targets of these drugs include hematologic malignancies as well as the solid tumors (68) . Four of these agents have entered into phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in subjects with solid tumors as well as hematologic malignancies. Neuropathy is a class-wide side effect of proteasomal inhibitors, likely from accumulation of ubiquitin-laden proteins in dorsal root ganglia of patients receiving therapy. This effect could be avoided by targeting factors upstream of the proteasome (Figure 2 ). The first such compound to be tested in humans is MLN4924, which targets the NEDD8 activating enzyme required for activation of the Cullin-RING proteins (69) ; this drug globally suppresses ubiquitination through Cullin-RING ligases, which includes all SCF E3 ligase family members and others. In vitro activity of this agent reduces tumor burden in multiple models via tumor cell apoptosis or autophagy. Four phase 1 clinical trials for MLN4924 safety testing are now underway.\r\n Another newly characterized drug is CC0651, the first smallmolecule E2 ligase inhibitor, with high potency and specificity for the E2 ligase Cdc34 (70) . This drug suppresses ubiquitination through Cullin-RING E3 ligases that depend on Cdc34. CC0651 and MLN4924 would therefore theoretically have highly overlapping pharmacology, and may have synergistic effects.\r\n The small molecule tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME) was described as an inhibitor of the APC E3 ligase required for dismantling the spindle assembly checkpoint and completion of mitotic division (71) . TAME prevents depletion of cyclin B1, thereby leading to mitotic arrest in metaphase. The next putative selective target of the ubiquitination-proteasome pathways is to target individual subunits of the E3 ligases. Although no drugs with this activity have entered clinical trials, there is significant research in this area.\r\n FBP-specific inhibitors. The first report of an E3 ligase-targeting drug identified SCF-I2, discovered by small-molecule interrogation of the SCF Cdc4 complex by its ability to displace the SCF from its phosphodegron in a yeast system. This molecule antagonized SCF Cdc4 , but not SCF complexes with related FBPs nor the human ortholog, FBXW7 (72) .\r\n Another small molecule inhibits SCF FBXO3 by targeting the FBXO3 C-terminal ApaG domain, a bacteria-like domain found in only two other genes in humans. This compound, BC1215, shows potent blockade of FBXO3 activity with a robust decrease in TRAFs and downstream inflammatory mediators released from endotoxin-stimulated human blood monocytes. BC-1215 effectively reduced inflammation and lung injury in preclinical models of sepsis and ALI (30) . This demonstration of a targeted, and specific inhibitor to a single FBP requires further testing, but if successful, has far-reaching implications and may set the stage for a new genus of antiinflammatory drugs.\r\n In summary, the UPS in lung biology is a fundamental area of research and discovery. The activities of many E3 ligases and FBPs remain unknown, and many more discoveries await us in the years to come. However, it is becoming clear that protein processing via the UPS plays a central role in most of the principal types of lung disease (Table 1) . Along with these newly described mechanisms of pathobiology come significant advances in our strategies for intervention to expand our arsenal of potential therapies. Although treatment with UPS-targeting medications has thus far been limited to hematologic malignancy, antiinflammatory agents that act on some UPS component may become commonplace in the next decade, especially as more selective compounds with fewer side effects are identified. It is difficult to ascertain how these innovations will impact medicine in the evolution of UPS-targeting therapy; however, it seems that new generations of drugs acting on this important system will become the mainstay of therapy for some diseases.\r\n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org. Figure 2 . Drugs targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Bortezomib and carfilzomib are U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved proteasome inhibitors that block cleavage of substrate proteins through the 26S proteasome. Upstream inhibitors CC0651 and MLN4924 block ubiquitination by inhibition of the Cullin-RING E3 ligases by inhibition of the Cdc34 E2 enzyme and the NEDD8 activator of Cullin-RING E3 ligases, respectively, to temper cell proliferation. TAME blocks APC E3 ligase activity and causes mitotic arrest. The F-box specific inhibitor SCF-I2 blocks the yeast Cdc-4 F-box proteindependent ubiquitination of substrate proteins (but is not active on human FBPs), and BC-1215 prevents SCF FBXO3mediated substrate ubiquitination and degradation of the FBXL2 protein, enhancing SCF FBXL2 -dependent TRAF degradation, decreasing inflammation.

Insights into the molecular pathophysiology of these diseases have greatly increased. Maintenance of any healthy tissue requires stringent quality control at the protein level. All cellular proteins undergo tightly regulated turnover in the cell to prevent improper activity or unnecessary accumulation of dysfunctional proteins. Protein degradation also changes critical cellular protein concentrations in response to chemical signals or for important cellular events such as mitosis. Major protein regulatory systems include the autophagic\/lysosomal pathways and the more prevalent UPS (1) . The system is hierarchical, with one or two E1 enzymes described in mammalian cells, about 40 E2 enzymes, and more than 1,000 E3 ligases described. There is also a family of \"Ubox\" E3 ligases, which do not have enzymatic activity and mostly bridge catalytically active E2 enzymes, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to the target protein. The E3 ligases are diverse, represented by hundreds of genes in humans, and are highly represented in all eukaryotes (9) . The largest family of Cullin-RING E3 ligases is the Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein (SCF) family, a canonical multimodule E3 ubiquitination complex often causing target proteasomal degradation. The F-box proteins (FBPs) are interchangeable and confer substrate specificity through recognition of post-translationally modified degron motifs within substrates via target-binding domains, and tether substrate proteins to the Cullin protein of the SCF complex via Fbox domains (10) . Each FBP causes degradation of a specific set of target proteins by unique degron recognition. Schematic of the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system.

Proteasome dysregulation as a microbial pathogenic mechanism. Pathogens can exploit host cell UPS machinery to their advantage. C-terminal CFTR deletions are processed normally, but rapidly shuttled to the proteasome for degradation (21) , while normal CFTR membrane expression is regulated by E3 ligase C-CBL, mediating ubiquitination and endosomal internalization (22) . In addition to its regulation of HIF-1a protein concentrations discussed previously, vHL protein also controls edema clearance during hypoxia, where it mediates degradation of Na-K-ATPase (24) . SHARPIN mutant mice develop a proliferative dermatitis, and patients with mutations of HOIL-1L and thus LUBAC deficiency have protracted inflammatory disorders and invasive bacterial infections (29) . Immune tolerance is mediated, in part, by the Ub E3 ligase Itch, which degrades the phosphorylated JunB, a Th2-specific transcription factor. Although the E3 ligase RING finger LIM domain-binding protein has been shown to target HDAC2 in other systems (43) , its role in the lung has not been described; regardless, loss of HDAC2 causes aberrant inflammatory gene transcription and feed-forward inflammation in some smokers, with HDAC2 levels correlating inversely with COPD severity (44) .

These factors include increased recognition of the diversity of human-associated microbiota, their roles in health and in diseases associated with chronic inflammation, and advancements in technologies and tools that have facilitated such discoveries about the microbiota in organ systems outside of the lung. Therefore, the overarching goals of lung microbiome research are: to identify and characterize microbial populations associated with the respiratory tract and lungs; to understand their roles in lung health and disease; and, we hope, to allow the development of improved approaches for diagnosing and treating chronic respiratory diseases in which the microbiome has a role. Recent studies of the lung microbiome have yielded a number of interesting findings but also highlighted questions and challenges for researchers and clinicians. In December 2011, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a workshop to identify key issues and areas for further attention or development to advance research on the lung microbiome. Current knowledge and the state of research on the lung and related areas of human microbiome investigation were reviewed and discussed.\r\n Keywords: microbiome; lung; gut Knowledge about human-associated microbiota, defined as the microorganisms inhabiting specific organ and body system niches, has increased rapidly in recent years. Fueled by the development and application of more sensitive, culture-independent tools for detecting microbes, in particular bacteria, a multitude of studies examining the microbiota in specific body habitats have been performed (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Recent investigations led by members of research consortiums, such as the European Metageno(Biol)mics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHit) project (7) and the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Human Microbiome Project (8, 9) , have contributed to our knowledge about the human microbiome. These studies have cataloged human microbiota associated with the skin, oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina, and, more recently, the respiratory tract. They also have suggested that the presence or composition of microbiota in a given niche can be a determinant of whether site-specific inflammation or disease is present. The number of microbial cells in the human body exceeds the number of human cells by an order of magnitude (10) , so that the estimated microbial gene pool far surpasses that of the host (11) . Thus, understanding how the \"microbiome\"defined as the totality of microbes, their genomic elements, and their interactions in a given environment-contributes to pathologic or nonpathologic states is of great interest.\r\n In contrast to other organ systems, such as the gastrointestinal tract, investigation of the lung microbiome has emerged only fairly recently. This development represents an extension of longstanding interest in pulmonary disease research to understand potential links between specific microbial exposures and chronic respiratory disease. Few large-scale studies of the lung microbiome have been performed to date. In the Human Microbiome Project, sampling of the anterior nares represents the sole \"airway\" site, among the five body sites targeted for microbial sequencing (12) . Objectives of the Lung HIV Microbiome Project (LHMP), which is sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, are to study the respiratory tract microbiome in HIV-infected as well as non-HIV-infected individuals (13) . Other recent studies have described the compositions of airway or lung tissue-associated microbiota in healthy individuals and\/or in those with existing obstructive lung diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . Moreover, correlations between clinical features of disease and characteristics of the lung microbial community have been observed (15, 19, 20, 22) . Given the technologies currently available or on the horizon, and the knowledge being gleaned from other areas of human microbiome research, there is great potential to advance understanding of how our respiratory microbiota may contribute to lung disease or health.\r\n The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Division of Lung Diseases convened a workshop entitled \"The Role of the Lung Microbiome in Health and Disease\" on December 15 and 16, 2011; the objectives were to identify questions and challenges that need further attention to advance research on the lung microbiome. Participants included clinical investigators studying asthma, COPD, CF, and human HIV infection, as well as laboratory scientists conducting investigations of the microbiome and microbiota through use of the approaches of microbiology, genomics, and biostatistics. The workshop covered the following areas: (1) review of current studies of the lung microbiome in health and disease, (2) review of gut microbiome studies that might serve as templates for lung microbiome research, and (3) approaches and methodologies being applied in other microbiome disease research contexts.\r\n focus on gut and existing lung microbiome studies. It is important to recognize that studies of bacterial microbiota compose the vast majority of literature to date, whereas far less is known about potential fungal and viral members of the microbiome (23) (24) (25) .\r\n Extensive literature exists on the human gut microbiome, and many reviews are available (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) . Broadly, studies of the gut microbiome have encompassed characterization of differences in microbiota composition in states of health or disease, effects of diet or therapeutics on the gut microbiota (32), and metagenomics-based studies of the gut microbiome to investigate the pool of putative gene functions (11) . Historically, among the earliest established and widely used cultureindependent approaches to study bacterial communities in many environments are those based on analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biomarker gene. A conserved gene present in all bacteria and archaea species, 16S rRNA-based analyses enable phylogenetic classification of detected organisms based on polymorphisms in hypervariable sequence regions. Several large 16S rRNA sequence databases exist (e.g., Ribosomal Database Project; Greengenes) (33) .\r\n Through a different approach, metagenomics (34) is a way to characterize the pan-genomes present in a sample via shotgun sequencing of all DNA present and has more recently been applied to study the microbiome (11) .\r\n Commensal gut microbiota are essential for normal immune system development and contribute also to homeostatic and metabolic functions in the host (29) . The indigenous gut microbiota also can serve to resist colonization against specific enteric pathogens (35) . Perturbation of the gut microbiota, as occurs in mice that are germ-free or have been treated with systemic antibiotics, is associated with altered immune responses, decreased gut peristalsis, lower body temperature (36), altered sleep-wake cycle (37) , changes in serum cholesterol (38) , and increased susceptibility to infection. Thus, the gut microbiome exerts effects both locally and distally via mechanisms such as generated metabolites (38) or induced immunoregulatory responses. Feeding of select organisms to manipulate the composition of gut microbiota can lead to different immune responses, depending on the individual or group of organisms used (39) . Administration of products derived from specific bacterial species, including those considered to be probiotic, can lead to an expansion in relative numbers of regulatory T cells, which in turn has been associated with attenuated airway inflammation and reduced airway hyperresponsiveness (40, 41) .\r\n By contrast, literature on the respiratory microbiome in health and disease is much less extensive (42, 43) . Relatively few studies applying contemporary techniques for microbial community profiling, such as next-generation sequencing or microarray platforms, exist on the microbiome of other respiratory compartments, such as the naso-oropharynx (44, 45) or lower airways.\r\n In a study of six healthy individuals examined by detailed sampling of the upper and lower airways and through use of 16S rRNA-based pyrosequencing, the composition of lower airway microbiota appeared indistinguishable from that of the upper respiratory tract (supraglottic) samples (14) . Bioburden as determined from 16S rRNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was observed to diminish along the tracheobronchial tree. Rare lung-specific bacterial sequences could be identified but were low-level and not broadly shared between individuals. In contrast, differences in lower airway microbiota composition have been noted between healthy subjects and those with obstructive lung diseases like asthma and COPD (17, 19) . Given the anatomical continuity between the upper and lower respiratory tracts, obtaining lower respiratory samples for microbiome studies in living research subjects clearly presents challenges. Similar sampling concerns have been ascribed to analysis of stool specimens for inferring variability in microbiome biology from different sections of the lower GI tract.\r\n Recent studies of the lung microbiome have revealed other findings as well. Variation within the bronchial tree in lung microbiota composition has been described among subjects with asthma, COPD, and CF (15, 17, 46) , including heterogeneity in microbiota composition within the same lobe of the lung examined in COPD lung explants (15) . In addition, both microbial community diversity and distinct community compositions have been correlated with features of clinical disease, such as airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma (19) or the severity of airflow obstruction in COPD or CF (15, (20) (21) (22) .\r\n A recent study of human lung transplant recipients identified markedly higher bacterial burden in lung allografts compared with nontransplant control lungs (4). Both community structure and the types and relative proportions of bacteria differed from healthy subjects. Many transplant recipients showed outgrowth in lungs of specific bacterial lineages, often including anaerobic lineages not sampled by traditional respiratory culture. Longterm lung transplant failure has been linked in part to microbial factors, and whether aspects of community structure or specific bacteria identifiable by culture-independent methods are associated with transplant outcome is currently not known. This study also suggested that unbiased comprehensive microbiome approaches could add useful information to traditional culture in assessing lung infection.\r\n It is important to note that different 16S rRNA-based techniques have been applied to study bacterial microbiota composition in current lung microbiome studies. These include platforms such as terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, traditional 16S rRNA clone library generation with Sanger sequencing, 454-pyrosequencing, and phylogenetic microarrays. In addition to the intrinsic differences that exist between platforms, how samples are prepared for analysis, including extraction, primers used for PCR amplification steps, and the depth of sequencing, all can influence conclusions about the community members present.\r\n Finally, most attention so far has been directed to bacterial populations in the respiratory tract, but similar approaches can be applied to fungi using the 18S rRNA gene or internal transcribed spacer sequences. Although fungal microbiome methods and databases are considerably less developed than those for bacteria, studies have recently begun to apply fungal microbiome analysis to the upper respiratory tract and to the lungs (23, 47) .\r\n Given the nascency of lung microbiome research, there are many questions and challenges. Some of these overlap with ones encountered and already recognized in other areas of human microbiome research; others are unique to studying the lung microbiome. These issues may be organized into the following three areas: clinical, technological and analytical, and translational ( Figure 1 ).\r\n Several fundamental questions about the lung microbiome remain unanswered. These include whether a core lung microbiome exists, either across all individuals or among individuals defined by the presence or absence of specific diseases. Because bacteria can be detected in the lungs by 16S rRNA-based approaches, even in healthy individuals, whether the microbial community is stable, transient, or subject to frequent turnover at some level is unclear. Moreover, sampling the lower airways and lung tissue in living research subjects presents considerations unique to lung microbiome research, because the upper airways must be traversed to obtain samples. Concerns about contamination by microbiota traditionally associated with the upper respiratory tract are important. Yet finding such microbiota in lower lung specimens alternatively could imply a lower burden of true colonization.\r\n Many additional, clinically driven questions of interest encompass the nature and role of the lung microbiome in disease. Prior evidence of pathogenic roles for specific microbial infections is strongest in diseases such as CF, COPD, and asthma. However, how the microbial milieu potentially modulates pathogenicity of specific species is an active area of investigation (48, 49) . Furthermore, how described heterogeneity in microbial community composition in the lungs relates to clinical manifestations of disease is unclear. Conversely, there is heterogeneity in where the lung tends to be affected by disease, and how this interfaces with the local microbiome present is unknown. Lung transplantation is another clinical setting in which microbial factors are believed to play a central role in long-term outcome, and studies to address microbiome community effects on transplant outcome have only just begun (47) .\r\n A distinct but also clinically relevant question is whether microbiome techniques, by their minimally biased, comprehensive, and quantitative nature, might enhance understanding and diagnosing specific infections in the lower respiratory tract. Similarly, studies are just beginning to explore the usefulness of these approaches to investigations into the etiology or progression of lung diseases such as sarcoidosis and a 1 antitrypsin deficiency (www.gradslung.org [50] ).\r\n In addition to technical considerations in obtaining human specimens for study that accurately represent the intended source, such as the lung, additional issues arise in specimen processing and in the generation and analysis of complex datasets. Our capacity now to detect bacteria by culture-independent approaches is unprecedented in scale. However, given the sensitivity of tools such as next-generation sequencing platforms and microarrays, attention to how data are obtained is warranted. At the proximal end of the process, unintentional introduction of microorganisms from environmental sources can lead to their identification by these technologies. As inhalation of organisms in the air is an obvious route of entry, distinguishing contamination from what is truly resident in the respiratory tract is potentially challenging. Thus, controlling for potential sources, such as reagents used to obtain and process samples, is an important consideration.\r\n Biases that could be introduced in the process of attempting to characterize microbiota composition are also important to note. For example, some types of organisms are more difficult to lyse and extract their nucleic acid, such as gram-positive bacteria and fungi, so extraction protocols should be sound. Subsequent to this, amplification by PCR is a common step in current techniques to profile bacterial communities. In sequencing experiments, primers targeting one of the variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene are used. Depending on the variable region targeted, certain bacterial groups or species may not be well captured (51) . Detection of fungal microbiota can be done using 18S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer sequencing, whereas identification of viral members of the microbiome requires approaches other than marker-gene-directed PCR analysis.\r\n The amount of data generated from high-throughput sequencing methods presents formidable challenges in analysis. Datasets from microarray-based platforms are generally more manageable. Normalization of data and approaches for handling data noise, artifacts, and errors in reads are all important issues that require robust bioinformatics to ensure the most accurate conclusions. Depth of sequencing also can influence conclusions about the composition of the microbial community in a sample. The lower the number of reads on a per-sample basis, the less resolution achieved in identifying members of the microbiota, especially if communities are dominated by one or a few types of organisms.\r\n The necessary bioinformatics and analytic support required for performing microbiome studies are a major challenge, coupled with attendant risks of obtaining potentially biased information for the reasons discussed. Moreover, there currently are no robust ways of estimating power and significance calculation for purposes of study planning, given the high-dimensional nature of data generated. Collectively, all of the above issues factor additionally into deciding how many subjects or samples can feasibly be studied well in a given study.\r\n Ultimately, translating findings about the composition of lung microbiota into knowledge about their behavior and role in health or disease will require additional approaches. Determining how to cultivate as yet uncultured organisms would facilitate further characterization about the genetics and function of specific bacterial species of interest. This also would enable evaluation in vivo of whether an individual species or a collection of species in the microbiota community are most relevant. Metagenomics enables obtaining information on all the genomes present such that gene functions can be predicted. However, this requires adequate reference databases, which for some organisms are sparse. Metatranscriptomics aims to characterize the collective functional gene expression profiles present, including microbial and host. However, intrinsic challenges include the preponderance of rRNA that composes total RNA and the lack of distinguishing features of mature mRNA in prokaryotes to facilitate their isolation for analysis (in contrast to the polyadenylation present on the 39 end of eukaryotic mRNA). These are active areas of methodological research. Metabolomics represents another potentially useful approach to examine phenotypic and organism-host environment relationships. For example, specific small-molecule metabolites, which require gut microbiota for their generation, have been mechanistically linked to cardiovascular disease (52) .\r\n Finally, linking knowledge gained about the lung microbiota to downstream outcomes on host disease or health requires a potential shift in the usual view of approaching translational research. Traditionally, this has been a linear view from basic science, hypothesis-driven research to translational experiments and subsequently clinical investigations. In the current era of microbiome studies, these links are more bidirectional between observational findings from surveying the microbiome and hypothesis-driven basic science. For instance, hypotheses may be generated from findings about the microbiome in clinical research studies and then tested in animal models.\r\n From the workshop, a number of issues were identified as most important to address for the future of lung microbiome research ( Figure 1 ). These are summarized as follows:\r\n 1. Challenges in lung sample collection, and recognition of the potential for upper respiratory tract carryover as well as environmental sources of admixture. Given the great sensitivity of newer molecular tools for microbiota profiling, findings are subject to potential confounding from representation of organisms not necessarily derived from the lung or lower airways. These issues are important to consider when designing and performing lung microbiome studies.\r\n 2. Observational studies are necessary to continue to build knowledge and reference about the types, abundance, and distributions of microbial populations throughout the human respiratory tract. Such studies are important for hypothesis generation and for subsequent controlled experiments or clinical intervention studies. The resultant data also can be used to perform mechanistic experiments to determine why observed clinical associations exist. Focus on a few targeted disease populations in which viral, bacterial, and\/or fungal organisms are likely to play a role may initially be most useful. In this context, high-quality molecular datasets of the microbiome could be obtained from leveraging existing disease study cohorts rather than development of new study cohorts.\r\n 3. Investigation of viral and fungal microbial communities in the lungs, including their characterization and potential interactions with other members of the microbiome and host. Most of the focus in studies to date has been on bacterial microbiota. Because specific viral and fungal species are known to cause respiratory disease, further knowledge of the viral and fungal microbiota is needed and may yield important insights.\r\n 4. Development of noninvasive biomarkers of lung microbial populations. Useful methodologies would include ways to study lung microbial burden and measure relevant biomarkers of the microbiome in airway samples collected in a minimally invasive manner.\r\n 5. Development of noninvasive imaging techniques, new or adapted from existing ones that might provide reliable spatial maps of the lung microbiome. In addition, techniques that could characterize the metabolic state of existing microorganisms in the lung microbiome would be useful.\r\n 6. Investigations of functional properties of the lung microbiome to better define consequences of perturbation of microbial communities and understand what constitutes homeostasis or lack thereof. This might include transcriptomic, metabolomic, or proteomic analysis of microbial populations, in addition to comprehensive identification, and could be accomplished through integration with genomic and other \"-omic\" datasets in healthy and disease states.\r\n 7. Research on the gut-lung axis and the potential role that gut microbial populations might play in the development of respiratory disease. This might include metabolic disturbances or autoimmune mechanisms that affect airway health.\r\n 8. Effective use of animal studies and other models to further develop mechanistic understanding of respiratory microbiome-host interactions suggested by descriptive human studies.\r\n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.

Therefore, the overarching goals of lung microbiome research are: to identify and characterize microbial populations associated with the respiratory tract and lungs; to understand their roles in lung health and disease; and, we hope, to allow the development of improved approaches for diagnosing and treating chronic respiratory diseases in which the microbiome has a role. Recent studies of the lung microbiome have yielded a number of interesting findings but also highlighted questions and challenges for researchers and clinicians. They also have suggested that the presence or composition of microbiota in a given niche can be a determinant of whether site-specific inflammation or disease is present. In contrast to other organ systems, such as the gastrointestinal tract, investigation of the lung microbiome has emerged only fairly recently. Few large-scale studies of the lung microbiome have been performed to date. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Division of Lung Diseases convened a workshop entitled \"The Role of the Lung Microbiome in Health and Disease\" on December 15 and 16, 2011; the objectives were to identify questions and challenges that need further attention to advance research on the lung microbiome. focus on gut and existing lung microbiome studies. It is important to recognize that studies of bacterial microbiota compose the vast majority of literature to date, whereas far less is known about potential fungal and viral members of the microbiome (23) (24) (25) . Broadly, studies of the gut microbiome have encompassed characterization of differences in microbiota composition in states of health or disease, effects of diet or therapeutics on the gut microbiota (32), and metagenomics-based studies of the gut microbiome to investigate the pool of putative gene functions (11) . Commensal gut microbiota are essential for normal immune system development and contribute also to homeostatic and metabolic functions in the host (29) . Similar sampling concerns have been ascribed to analysis of stool specimens for inferring variability in microbiome biology from different sections of the lower GI tract. Both community structure and the types and relative proportions of bacteria differed from healthy subjects. It is important to note that different 16S rRNA-based techniques have been applied to study bacterial microbiota composition in current lung microbiome studies. These include platforms such as terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, traditional 16S rRNA clone library generation with Sanger sequencing, 454-pyrosequencing, and phylogenetic microarrays. Moreover, sampling the lower airways and lung tissue in living research subjects presents considerations unique to lung microbiome research, because the upper airways must be traversed to obtain samples. Concerns about contamination by microbiota traditionally associated with the upper respiratory tract are important. Yet finding such microbiota in lower lung specimens alternatively could imply a lower burden of true colonization. In addition to technical considerations in obtaining human specimens for study that accurately represent the intended source, such as the lung, additional issues arise in specimen processing and in the generation and analysis of complex datasets. Detection of fungal microbiota can be done using 18S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer sequencing, whereas identification of viral members of the microbiome requires approaches other than marker-gene-directed PCR analysis. Datasets from microarray-based platforms are generally more manageable.

An acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an episode of acute respiratory worsening without an identifiable etiology. Occult viral infection has been proposed as a possible cause of acute exacerbation. Objectives: To use unbiased genomics-based discovery methods to define the role of viruses in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage and serum from patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, stable disease, and acute lung injury were tested for viral nucleic acid using multiplex polymerase chain reaction, pan-viral microarray, and highthroughput cDNA sequencing. Measurements and Main Results: Four of forty-three patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had evidence of common respiratory viral infection (parainfluenza [ 12] ) in patients with acute exacerbation. TTV infection was significantly more common in patients with acute exacerbation than stable controls (P \u00bc 0.0003), but present in a similar percentage of acute lung injury controls. Deep sequencing of a subset of acute exacerbation cases confirmed the presence of TTV but did not identify additional viruses.\r\n Conclusions: Viral infection was not detected in most cases of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. TTV was present in a significant minority of cases, and cases of acute lung injury; the clinical significance of this finding remains to be determined.\r\n Keywords: acute lung injury; virus; infection; pulmonary fibrosis; etiology Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease with no known cause or cure (1, 2) . Although some patients experience a steady progression of disease over time, many have periods of relative stability punctuated by episodes of acute respiratory worsening that can be fatal (3, 4) . When no identifiable cause for this acute worsening is found, it is termed an \"acute exacerbation\" of IPF (5) .\r\n Acute exacerbation of IPF is defined as an idiopathic acute worsening of dyspnea characterized radiologically by the presence of bilateral ground glass abnormality on high-resolution computed tomography scan of the chest (5) . It is estimated that between 5% and 10% of patients with IPF experience an acute exacerbation annually, with more physiologically advanced disease at higher risk (4) (5) (6) . It remains unclear whether acute exacerbation of IPF represents a primary acceleration of the underlying fibroproliferative process in IPF or is a clinically occult secondary complication (e.g., infection) (5, 7) .\r\n Acute exacerbation of IPF is often accompanied by fever, increased cough, and myalgia, suggesting an infectious etiology. Respiratory viruses have been considered a particularly likely cause, based on the similarities in clinical and radiologic presentation between acute exacerbation of IPF and viral pneumonitis and the poor sensitivity of standard methods of viral detection (5) . Also, there may be an increased incidence of acute exacerbation of IPF in East Asia, a finding that could be explained by an environmental factor, such as an endemic virus (8) (9) (10) . Preliminary evaluations of the role of infection in acute exacerbation have yielded mixed results (11, 12) .\r\n In this study, we tested the hypothesis that acute exacerbation of IPF is caused by occult viral infection. We prospectively collected bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from patients experiencing acute exacerbation of IPF and controls (stable IPF and acute lung injury [ALI]) and used multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a pan-viral microarray discovery platform to test for the presence of known and novel viruses. Nextgeneration parallel sequencing (deep sequencing) was applied to a subset of acute exacerbation samples to increase the sensitivity of viral detection.\r\n Patients with acute exacerbation of IPF were identified prospectively from two centers (University of Ulsan, Korea, and Tosei General Hospital, Japan). Sequential subjects with acute exacerbation of IPF were enrolled if they underwent bronchoscopy and were consented. Diagnostic criteria for acute exacerbation of IPF were prespecified according to established criteria (5) . All patients with acute exacerbation had negative clinical evaluation for infectious causes including routine bacterial and viral BAL antibody titers and cultures for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, human parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, human cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella-zoster virus. Control patients with stable IPF (defined by the absence of acute exacerbation) and ALI were identified from an existing cohort at a single center (University of Ulsan, Korea) and underwent bronchoscopy at the time of diagnosis. IPF and ALI were defined by consensus criteria (1, 13, 14) . BAL from a case of IPF that was positive for rhinovirus and CMV was included as a blinded positive control. All centers received approval from their institutional review board or equivalent, and all patients provided informed consent.\r\n In all cases, bronchoscopy was performed as part of patients' clinical evaluations. In most cases, BAL was collected within the first 48 hours of admission to the hospital. In general, BAL was performed in a single subsegment of the right middle lobe or lingula, with at least 100 ml of sterile saline instilled. Blood was not collected as part of the initial study protocol. A subset of acute exacerbation samples and stable IPF controls underwent phlebotomy at the time of bronchoscopy as part of a separate ongoing repository study. These samples were available to us for analysis. All samples were stored at 280 8 C until ready for processing. Total RNA was extracted from 200 ml of each sample using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\r\n A blinded, nested respiratory multiplex PCR was run on the BAL samples from acute exacerbation of IPF and stable IPF controls for prespecified respiratory viruses (influenza virus, human parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus, human enterovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, and human adenovirus) (15) . PCR was also performed to confirm viral signatures present on pan-viral microarray analysis (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus, and torque teno virus (TTV) using published nested primer sets (16) (17) (18) . Additional PCR for TTV was performed on BAL samples from ALI controls and on serum samples from a subset of acute exacerbation of IPF and stable IPF controls to define better the epidemiology of TTV.\r\n Acute exacerbation of IPF samples and stable IPF controls were randomly amplified to generate cDNA, which was hybridized blindly to a pan-viral microarray as previously described (19) . Arrays were scanned using the Axon 4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and intensities were calculated using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices). The presence of a viral signature was determined using Cluster 3.0 (20) and E-predict (21) . All microarray data were deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession GSE27578.\r\n BALs from a subgroup of study patients with acute exacerbation of IPF were selected for deep sequencing on the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA) based on the presence of both fever and myalgia, symptoms suggestive of a viral-like illness. Deep sequencing libraries were prepared and analyzed as described in the online supplement. The deep sequencing reads were submitted to the Short Read Archive (SRA) under the accession SRX042016.\r\n Clinical data are expressed as means or percentages, unless otherwise stated. The primary comparison was between BAL samples from acute exacerbation of IPF and stable IPF controls. Additional comparisons were made between BAL samples from acute exacerbation of IPF and ALI controls, and serum samples from acute exacerbation of IPF and stable IPF controls. In all cases, intergroup comparisons were performed conservatively using nonparametric methods (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and chi-square\/Fisher exact analyses as appropriate. Regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between clinical factors, PCR positivity, and survival. Clinical data analysis was performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Statistical significance was defined as a P value less than 0.05.\r\n Sixty patients with acute exacerbation of IPF (52 Korean, 8 Japanese) were identified between 2006 and 2009. Forty-three of these underwent bronchoscopy and were enrolled in the study. The median time from diagnosis to acute exacerbation was 85 days. Their clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . Twelve (28%) of the acute exacerbation of patients with IPF presented with both fever and myalgia, suggestive of a viral-like illness. Forty patients with stable IPF and twenty-nine patients with ALI were included as controls. Patients with ALI predominantly had lower respiratory tract infection (90%) as the underlying cause for their lung injury. These patients were all mechanically ventilated and had a mean PaO 2 \/FiO 2 ratio of 228. Serum was available from 22 acute exacerbation of patients with IPF and 31 stable IPF controls.\r\n Four acute exacerbation of IPF BAL samples (9%) were positive for common respiratory viruses by initial multiplex PCR (two for rhinovirus, one for human coronavirus-OC43, and one for parainfluenza virus-1). All stable IPF samples were negative for common respiratory viruses (P \u00bc 0.12 compared with acute exacerbation of IPF samples) ( Table 2 ). Array analysis of acute exacerbation of IPF BAL samples revealed the presence of Immunosuppressive therapy includes corticosteroids with or without immunomodulator therapy.\r\n TTV and several human herpesviruses, and accurately identified rhinovirus and CMV in the known positive control. To pursue these findings further, we performed sensitive genome-specific PCR reactions for HSV, Epstein-Barr virus, and TTV. This yielded 15 additional BAL positives in acute exacerbation of IPF samples (Table 3) . Of these additional viruses, only TTV was significantly more common in acute exacerbation of IPF compared with stable controls (28% vs. 0%; P \u00bc 0.0003). Four BAL samples revealed double infections: two with TTV and rhinovirus, one with TTV and parainfluenza virus-1, and one with TTV and HSV. One BAL sample revealed a triple infection of TTV, Epstein-Barr virus, and coronavirus. Overall, 14 (33%) of acute exacerbation of IPF samples were positive for virus compared with no positives in the stable IPF samples (P , 0.0001). There was no difference in the frequency of fever and myalgia between virus-positive and virus-negative cases, and there was no significant difference in the use of corticosteroid treatment.\r\n BALs from 12 of the study patients with acute exacerbation of IPF were selected for deep sequencing to investigate the possibility of viruses being present but undetected by PCR and microarray. Of these samples, two were PCR-positive for tested viruses, one for TTV and one for TTV and HSV. After initial quality filtering, approximately 26 million pairs, or 52 million total reads, comprised the primary dataset. Each of the 12 barcoded acute exacerbation of IPF samples was represented with at least 3 million high-quality reads. Over 98% of the reads were derived from human origin, and of the remaining reads, approximately 0.1% were recognizably bacterial in origin. Only a few hundred were potentially attributable to known nonhuman eukaryotes and viruses. Aside from bacteriophages, only three viruses (two TTVs and one HSV) were found, consistent with the PCR results. After all stages of mapping to a sequence database were finished, approximately 0.6% of the original dataset remained without attribution.\r\n Comparison of TTV-positive and TTV-negative Acute Exacerbation of IPF Samples There were no significant differences in age, sex, baseline pulmonary function, or time to bronchoscopy in TTV-positive acute exacerbation ofpatients with IPF compared with TTV-negative acute exacerbation of IPF patients (data not shown). Patients who were TTV positive appeared sicker, with 58% requiring mechanical ventilation (vs. 29% in patients who were TTV negative; P \u00bc 0.09) and 75% dying at 60 days (vs. 42% in patients who were TTV negative; P \u00bc 0.06). Overall median survival time in the patients who were TTV positive was 29 days (vs. 88 d in patients who were TTV negative; P \u00bc 0.19) (Figure 1 ). Bivariate regression analysis of potential independent predictors of survival time (presence or absence of prednisone treatment at the time of BAL, mechanical ventilation and the time of BAL, and TTV positivity on BAL) revealed only mechanical ventilation as statistically significant (hazard ratio, 2.30; P \u00bc 0.03). TTV positivity was not an independent predictor of survival time (hazard ratio, 1.65; P \u00bc 0.20).\r\n A total of 6 (27%) of 22 patients with acute exacerbation of IPF were PCR positive for TTV in serum, compared with 5 (16%) of 31 patients with stable IPF (P \u00bc 0.34). There was no relationship between serum and BAL positivity. Three (50%) of the six patients with acute exacerbation who were PCR positive in serum were also PCR positive in BAL. Four (25%) of the 16 patients with acute exacerbation who were PCR negative in serum were PCR positive in BAL.\r\n The statistically significant link between BAL-associated TTV and acute exacerbation of IPF prompted us to also examine BAL samples from 29 patients with ALI. TTV was detected in 7 (24%) of 29 BAL samples from ALI patients; this was not significantly different from the prevalence of TTV in BAL samples from acute exacerbation of IPF (28%; P \u00bc 0.73).\r\n Using highly sensitive PCR, pan-viral microarrays, and deep sequencing technologies in a large, well-described cohort of patients with acute exacerbation of IPF and controls, we found that most cases of acute exacerbation of IPF had no evidence of an underlying viral infection. This suggests that viral infection is not a common cause of acute exacerbation of IPF. Overall, we found viral nucleic acid in the BAL of 33% of patients with acute exacerbation of IPF; no viruses were found in samples from stable IPF controls. There were two rhinoviruspositive samples, one coronavirus-positive sample, and one parainfluenza virus-positive sample, suggesting that a small minority (9%) of acute exacerbations of IPF may be caused by occult infection with common respiratory viruses. Surprisingly, the most common virus detected in the BAL of acute exacerbation of IPF patients was TTV, which was present in 28% of acute exacerbation BAL samples. This finding was not unique to acute exacerbation of IPF because 24% of BAL samples from ALI controls were also TTV positive.\r\n Two recent studies have commented indirectly on the possible role of occult viral infection in acute exacerbation of IPF. The first study performed gene expression microarrays on whole lung tissue from 8 patients who died of acute exacerbation of IPF, 23 patients with stable IPF, and 15 healthy controls (12) . The authors concluded that acute exacerbation of IPF was characterized by a pattern of enhanced epithelial injury and proliferation, but found no gene expression profiles indicative of a response to viral or bacterial infection. In a second study of 27 patients presenting with acute decline in fibrotic lung disease (13 of whom had confirmed acute exacerbation of IPF), 5 had antigenic or PCR evidence of viral infection (one parainfluenza virus, two HSV, and two CMV infections), three of which were missed on standard viral culture (11) .\r\n Our study expands significantly on previously published reports. First, we take an unbiased approach to viral discovery using cutting-edge genomic methodology. It is the first study to do this in acute exacerbation of IPF. Our use of sequencing to confirm all suspected viruses rules out the possibility of spurious PCR results, a common pitfall of the technique. Second, our large cohort of well-defined patients with acute exacerbation with adequate controls allows for greater certainty regarding our conclusions. Third, we have identified an unexpected virus (TTV) that was associated with 33% of acute exacerbations, and that was absent in stable IPF.\r\n The pathogenetic significance of TTV in acute exacerbation of IPF BAL is unclear. TTV is a nonenveloped single-stranded circular DNA virus that exists in a genetically diverse clade (22, 23) . The virus seems to have broad tissue tropism because it has been detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bone marrow, spleen, liver, and lung (22) . Infection with TTV in the human population is worldwide, with prevalences of viremia ranging from 8%-80% depending on the population studied and detection methodology used. When only considering the hemi-nested PCR of the N22 region used in this study, rates of TTV DNA found in healthy blood donors range from 8.4%-12% (24, 25) and do not seem to correlate with the geographic location of the patients. Most infected subjects are asymptomatic, and to date efforts to link TTV viremia with any acute or chronic pathologic state have been unsuccessful (22) . Although there have been reports of TTV in the upper respiratory tract (nasopharynx and oral cavity) (26), TTV has not been identified in BAL fluids. TTV has previously been detected in the serum of 12 (36%) of 33 Japanese patients with IPF. In this study, TTV appeared more frequently in cases that progressed to acute exacerbations, and TTV positivity was suggested to correlate with worse survival (27) . Our findings do not show a correlation between the presence of TTV in the serum and the presence of TTV in the BAL, or any correlation between serum TTV positivity and a diagnosis of acute exacerbation.\r\n It is possible that de novo TTV infection in the lung causes direct alveolar epithelial cell injury and acute respiratory worsening.\r\n If so, this process does not seem to be unique to acute exacerbation of IPF because we detected TTV at a similar frequency in BAL from patients with ALI. Although this does not exclude a potential role for TTV in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbation of IPF, it is also compatible with the idea that inflammation or injury in the lung may nonspecifically trigger local TTV replication, or may result in increased vascular permeability in the lung allowing circulating virus to enter the alveolar compartment. In the latter two cases, the presence of TTV would represent a consequence of lung inflammation rather than its cause. The idea that local TTV replication might be enhanced by underlying inflammatory signaling is supported by in vitro studies of PBMCs from donors who are TTV negative (28) . These PBMCs were infected in vitro with TTV, cultured with and without the presence of phytohemagglutinin, lipopolysaccharide, and interleukin-2, and then examined for evidence of TTV replication. In this experiment, TTV mRNA and replicative intermediates were only found in the stimulated PBMCs, consistent with an infectionamplifying role for inflammatory signaling.\r\n The methodologies used in this study have unparalleled sensitivity for viral detection. The multiplex nested PCR is several fold more sensitive than virus culture and direct immunofluorescent tests, with the ability to amplify less than 10 copies of target nucleic acid (15) . For viral discovery, however, PCR is of limited use because it identifies only a priori viral targets. Pan-viral microarray precludes the need for a preconceived list of targets, although even with its proved sensitivity, its benefit is dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio of the nucleic acid (19) . The use of deep sequencing to look further for evidence of viral infection in a high-risk subpopulation of patients with acute exacerbation therefore adds confidence to our results, because it produces an unbiased, high-resolution description of the microbial landscape of the sample tested. This technology has been used to identify novel viruses in human diarrhea, and to describe the microbiome of the distal gut (31, 32) , but never in BAL (29, 30) . In the current study, two samples subjected to deep sequencing were positive for known viruses by PCR and pan-viral array screening. Using an efficient and sensitive pipeline for sorting reads, these positive PCR findings were confirmed, and no additional viruses were detected in these or the other samples tested. Interpretation of these findings must be tempered by the fact that existing computational methods for recognizing potential viral genomes are imperfect, and may fail to identify novel agents with only limited homology to known viral genera. The same is true of array-based viral detection methods.\r\n One important limitation of this study is the potential for false-negative results because of the timing of sample collection. BAL was performed early in the course of hospitalization, most commonly in the first 48 hours after admission, and the median time from symptom onset to sampling was 7 days. Importantly, no difference in the time from symptom onset to sample collection was found between virus-positive and virus-negative cases. The duration of replicating virus in BAL is largely unknown, and it is possible that a virus could have stopped shedding during this time. In this study, we have maximized our likelihood of detecting virus by obtaining BAL samples early after admission and using highly sensitive viral detection techniques.\r\n In summary, this study used unbiased, highly sensitive genomicsbased discovery methods to investigate the role of viral infection in a large, well-characterized cohort of patients with acute exacerbation of IPF. The results of this study suggest that most cases of acute exacerbation of IPF are not caused by viral infection. Future research into the etiology of acute exacerbation of IPF should confirm these findings, further investigate the role of TTV, and consider other possible occult complications (e.g., aspiration) that may cause acute respiratory worsening in these patients.\r\n Author Disclosure: S.C.W. does not have a financial relationship with a commercial entity that has an interest in the subject of this manuscript.

Keywords: acute lung injury; virus; infection; pulmonary fibrosis; etiology Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease with no known cause or cure (1, 2) . Preliminary evaluations of the role of infection in acute exacerbation have yielded mixed results (11, 12) . Sequential subjects with acute exacerbation of IPF were enrolled if they underwent bronchoscopy and were consented. Control patients with stable IPF (defined by the absence of acute exacerbation) and ALI were identified from an existing cohort at a single center (University of Ulsan, Korea) and underwent bronchoscopy at the time of diagnosis. BAL from a case of IPF that was positive for rhinovirus and CMV was included as a blinded positive control. In most cases, BAL was collected within the first 48 hours of admission to the hospital. Blood was not collected as part of the initial study protocol. These samples were available to us for analysis. PCR was also performed to confirm viral signatures present on pan-viral microarray analysis (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus, and torque teno virus (TTV) using published nested primer sets (16) (17) (18) . Additional PCR for TTV was performed on BAL samples from ALI controls and on serum samples from a subset of acute exacerbation of IPF and stable IPF controls to define better the epidemiology of TTV. Arrays were scanned using the Axon 4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and intensities were calculated using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices). All microarray data were deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession GSE27578. Clinical data are expressed as means or percentages, unless otherwise stated. In all cases, intergroup comparisons were performed conservatively using nonparametric methods (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and chi-square\/Fisher exact analyses as appropriate. Regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between clinical factors, PCR positivity, and survival. Statistical significance was defined as a P value less than 0.05. The median time from diagnosis to acute exacerbation was 85 days. Their clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . These patients were all mechanically ventilated and had a mean PaO 2 \/FiO 2 ratio of 228. Serum was available from 22 acute exacerbation of patients with IPF and 31 stable IPF controls. Four acute exacerbation of IPF BAL samples (9%) were positive for common respiratory viruses by initial multiplex PCR (two for rhinovirus, one for human coronavirus-OC43, and one for parainfluenza virus-1). Of these additional viruses, only TTV was significantly more common in acute exacerbation of IPF compared with stable controls (28% vs. 0%; P \u00bc 0.0003). There was no difference in the frequency of fever and myalgia between virus-positive and virus-negative cases, and there was no significant difference in the use of corticosteroid treatment. After all stages of mapping to a sequence database were finished, approximately 0.6% of the original dataset remained without attribution. There was no relationship between serum and BAL positivity. This suggests that viral infection is not a common cause of acute exacerbation of IPF. Surprisingly, the most common virus detected in the BAL of acute exacerbation of IPF patients was TTV, which was present in 28% of acute exacerbation BAL samples. The authors concluded that acute exacerbation of IPF was characterized by a pattern of enhanced epithelial injury and proliferation, but found no gene expression profiles indicative of a response to viral or bacterial infection. In a second study of 27 patients presenting with acute decline in fibrotic lung disease (13 of whom had confirmed acute exacerbation of IPF), 5 had antigenic or PCR evidence of viral infection (one parainfluenza virus, two HSV, and two CMV infections), three of which were missed on standard viral culture (11) . Our study expands significantly on previously published reports. Our use of sequencing to confirm all suspected viruses rules out the possibility of spurious PCR results, a common pitfall of the technique. If so, this process does not seem to be unique to acute exacerbation of IPF because we detected TTV at a similar frequency in BAL from patients with ALI. The use of deep sequencing to look further for evidence of viral infection in a high-risk subpopulation of patients with acute exacerbation therefore adds confidence to our results, because it produces an unbiased, high-resolution description of the microbial landscape of the sample tested. Interpretation of these findings must be tempered by the fact that existing computational methods for recognizing potential viral genomes are imperfect, and may fail to identify novel agents with only limited homology to known viral genera. One important limitation of this study is the potential for false-negative results because of the timing of sample collection. E.C. received funding for the Chui Lab from Abbott Diagnostics.

All rights reserved.\r\n Stem cells are of great potential in molecular biology research and regenerative medicine [1] . Their defining characteristics include the potential for proliferation and differentiation into various cell types. Recently, Ling et al. discovered a rare subpopulation of pulmonary cells at bronchoalveolar junctions of lung tissues, exhibiting slow cycling and Octamer-4 (Oct-4 \u00fe ) expressing [2] . Oct-4, a member of the family of POU-domain transcription factors, is an important regulator of self-renewal in pluripotent embryonic stem cells. The cells have been revealed as lung stem cells that form epithelial colonies in a serum-free culture and are able to differentiate into type I and II pneumocytes. In addition, they are prone to infection of the severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2, 3] . These findings are promising in drug screening, tissue engineering and functional genomics. Therefore, a robust and consistent cell culture system should be established to provide moderate to large numbers of cells on a routine basis [4e7]. Ling et al.'s earlier screening has determined that thin films of type I collagen on the tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) plates is most effective in forming high density colony cells [2] . However, the interactions of lung stem cells with their microenvironment remain obscure and need to be elucidated.\r\n Type I collagen is a long, fibrous structural protein, found in all multi-cellular animals as a major protein in extracellular matrix (ECM). A collagen monomer consists of three left-handed helices which arrange to an extended superhelix with roughly 1.5 nm in diameter and 300 nm in length. The monomers can spontaneously self-assemble in vivo and in vitro into fibrils with a periodicity of 67 nm, ranging 10e500 nm wide and up to several microns long. The spatial distribution and aggregation states of collagens have found to mediate the cellular signaling and development, through integrins recognitions [8, 9] . For example, the fibrillar structures of type I collagen have led to distinctive changes in gene expression, population, and morphological profiles of cultured smooth muscle cells (SMCs) [10e13]. The heat-denatured type I collagen (denatured collagen), whose ordered three-dimensional structure is destroyed [14] , promotes SMC cellular proliferation and spreading [15] , while native type I collagen (native collagen) inhibits its growth [10, 15] . Further mechanistic study suggested that native collagen suppresses cyclin E-associated kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) phosphorylation while increasing levels of the Cdk2 inhibitors p27 Kip1 and p21 Cip1\/waf1 . As a result, proliferation of SMCs is arrested in the G1 phase of the cycle [10] .\r\n The stromal cells surrounding the pulmonary stem cell colonies were found to have similar characteristics with mesenchymal cells carrying the a-smooth muscle actin marker [2] . It is therefore advantageous to engineer collagen substratums with distinct nanostructures in order to understand the effects to the stromal cells and, consequently, the pulmonary stem cell formation in the stem cellestromal cell co-culture. By adopting the previously developed methods with minor adjustment [12] , both native and heat-acid denatured collagen thin films were readily prepared under various collagen solution concentrations. We have characterized the surface thin film morphology, the fibrillar formation, and the film thickness with atomic force microscopy (AFM), and surface profiler. Moreover, the cultivation of pre-sorted colony cells allowed us to observe the exclusive interaction between colony cells and type I collagen films. The correlation among stem cells, stromal cells and biomaterials is revealed by monitoring the number and size of colonies and performing immunohistochemical staining for Oct-4 and a-smooth muscle actin.\r\n To begin with, neonatal imprinting control region (ICR) mice's lungs were removed, diced and washed with Hank's buffer solution containing penicillin (10 units\/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg\/ml) (both from SigmaeAldrich, St. Louis, MO). The lung pieces were soaked overnight in Joklik's minimum essential medium (JMEM; SigmaeAldrich) with 0.1% protease type-XIV (SigmaeAldrich) at 4 C. Subsequently, they were transferred to 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)\/JMEM, pipetted several times to release pulmonary cells and then filtered through a 100-mm nylon cell strainer. The released cells, with approximately 1.0e1.5 \u00c2 10 6 nucleated cells per neonatal mouse, were washed and re-suspended in an MCDB-201 medium containing insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) supplements (Bibco, Grand Island, NY). These cells were diluted to a density of 3 \u00c2 10 5 cells\/ml, and seeded 1 ml per well for a 24-well plate. After 1 day of incubation, the primary cultures were washed with MCDB-201 medium to remove unattached cells. Finally, both fresh medium with ITS supplement as well as epidermal growth factors (EGF), (1 ng\/ml, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were added. The cells were incubated in 5% CO 2 at 37 C for eight days, and then the colony was examined for quantification.\r\n Original rat-tail type I collagen (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was stocked in 0.02 N acetic acid (SigmaeAldrich) in order to prevent polymerization. To prepare the native collagen, original rat-tail type I collagen (0.8 ml, w4 mg\/ml) was neutralized with 10\u00c2 Ca 2\u00fe -and Mg 2\u00fe -free Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS; Invitrogen) (0.1 ml) and NaOH (0.1 N, 0.1 ml). To prepare the denatured collagen, original rat-tail type I collagen (w4 mg\/ml) was mixed with 0.4 M acetic acid, 10\u00c2 DPBS in a 16:1:2 ratio. The mixture was boiled for 30 min and neutralized with 1 N NaOH. The collagen concentration was then adjusted to 3.88 mg\/ml with 10\u00c2 DPBS. All concentrations of native and denatured collagen were prepared by serial 2.5-fold dilution with 1\u00c2 DPBS. Throughout the preparation process, all solutions were stored in ice to minimize polymerization until collagen was applied to 24-well TCPS plates (Corning Incorporated, Acton, MA). The surface area of the well bottom was 1.9 cm 2 . 180-ml collagen solutions with initial concentrations of 0, 0.016, 0.04, 0.1, 0.25, 0.62, 1.55 and 3.88 mg\/ml were dispensed and covered the well surfaces. They were then air-dried overnight in a sterile hood to deposit collagen onto TCPS surfaces, rinsed thrice with 1\u00c2 DPBS to remove non-adherent collagen and stored in 1\u00c2 DPBS at 4 C. Before use, they were rinsed once again with deionized (DI) water and air-dried in a hood. For the convenience, the collagen samples in this study are denoted by their native or denatured state and their initial solution concentrations, such as \"denatured, 3.88 mg\/ml\".\r\n AFM images of collagen thin films were recorded in air using the MFP-3D-BIO AFM (Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA). The AFM was operated in AC mode using the POINTPROBE-PLUS Silicon cantilevers (force constant of 42 N\/m and resonant frequency of 330 kHz, Nanosensors, Neuchatel, Switzerland). Before scanning, the collagen samples were rinsed with DI water to remove salts, and dried overnight in a laminar flow sterile hood.\r\n A KLA Tencor P-16\u00fe surface profiler (San Jose, CA) was used to measure surface thickness. The stylus tip size was 2 mm in diameter. Applied force, scan speed, sampling rate and scan length were 1 mg, 20 mm\/s, 200 Hz and 1000 mm, respectively. To prepare the surface for measurement, a thin stripe was taped to the polystyrene plate in advance to prevent partial surface contact with the collagen solution. After the collagen solution in the plate was air-dried in the sterile hood, the tape was removed to expose a bare TCPS surface. The differences in thickness between the bare TCPS and collagen films were measured.\r\n Surface tension contributes to a thick and heterogeneous collagen layer in the peripheral area on each well of the 24-well plate; only the central collagen layer within a 5 mm-radius is uniform and flat. Therefore, to obtain credible results, the quantitative cell counts, AFM and surface profiler scans were performed on the central area. The numbers of colonies with the comprising cell number ranges of below 25, between w25 and w100, and between w100 and w250 were counted separately.\r\n Immunocytochemical staining was performed to examine the cell characteristics [2] on collagen films. Cells in primary cultures were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and then placed in methanol:acetone at 1:1 for 2 min on ice. The cells were incubated with primary mouse antibody against the antigens of a-smooth muscle actin (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) and primary rabbit antibody against Oct-4 (Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 C. After an overnight incubation, the cells were washed with PBS, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and goat anti-mouse IgM conjugated with FITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch), respectively. Finally, the cells were counterstained with 4 0 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 min at room temperature.\r\n The colony cell isolation protocol was developed as previously reported [2] with the following modification. A quantity of 1 \u00c2 10 7 cells was collected from the primary culture after an 8-day incubation and washed in PBS, 3% FBS. Since the pulmonary stem cell positively expresses specific markers of CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR4) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD54) on the cell membrane, both stains were applied according to standard procedures. The cells were incubated in a polyclonal goat CXCR4 antibody (10 mg\/ml, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 30 min at 4 C and then washed with PBS, 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Thereafter, the cells were incubated with a Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (7.5 mg\/ml, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 30 min at 4 C and then washed with PBS, 3% FBS. For the second staining, the cells were incubated with a monoclonal R-Phycoerythrin (R-PE)-conjugated hamster anti-mouse (ICAM-1) CD54 antibody (4 mg\/ml, BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 C and then washed with PBS, 3% FBS. They were then stained with propidium iodide (PI) (1 mg\/ml, Sigma-eAldrich) to allow exclusion of nonviable cells. The pulmonary stem cells were sorted on a FACS-Vantage-SE flow cytometry system (BD). The sorted stem cells were re-seeded in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS (SigmaeAldrich) and 1% ITS, and MCDB-201 medium containing 1% ITS and 1 ng\/ml EGF, respectively. The density was 5 \u00c2 10 4 cells\/well for 12-well plates, which were pre-coated and air-dried with native and denatured collagen, (both at a concentration of 3.88 mg\/ml), for each culture medium.\r\n The thickness of both native and denatured collagen films was measured by a surface profiler. The average thickness of collagen films on TCPS increased exponentially with the initial concentrations (Fig. 1A) . Native collagen films, however, were roughly twice as thick as denatured films with identical initial concentrations. For example, the thicknesses of samples of collagen (native, 3.88 mg\/ml) and collagen (denatured, 3.88 mg\/ml) were 226 nm and 100 nm, respectively. Collagen (native, 1.55 mg\/ml) and (denatured, 1.55 mg\/ ml) were 24 nm and 14 nm, respectively. This difference can be attributed by the changes in physical properties of collagen solutions, as the polymerized native collagen solution conceivably is more viscous and less soluble, leading to porous structures in the films, than the denatured one thus precipitating thicker films. Due to the surface roughness of TCPS (in the order of 1e10 nm), as the initial concentrations are below 0.1 mg\/ml in native and 0.25 mg\/ml in denatured collagen solutions, the resulting film thicknesses cannot be measured accurately. In these diluted samples, existence of collagen molecules at surfaces was imaged by AFM.\r\n The AFM was utilized to examine the structures of collagen thin films at nanoscale resolution. For the samples prepared by native collagen solutions, surface morphology was significantly correlated to its initial concentration. In the film with low native collagen concentration, i.e. 0.62 mg\/ml, fibrillar collagen did not distribute uniformly on the TCPS, and supramolecular collagen was not observed (Fig. 1B (i) ). As the initial concentration was increased to 1.55 mg\/ml, fibrillar collagen of w200 nm in diameter appeared, and supramolecular collagen (approximately 1e2 mm in diameter, black arrow in Fig. 1B (ii) ) was observed to be formed by the twists of fibrils. With initial collagen solution at 3.88 mg\/ml, the film was covered with supramolecules of adsorbed collagen (Fig. 1B (iii) ). The thicker fibrillar structure is also confirmed by the Z -scale of 300 nm, compared with that of 100 nm for the other collagen films (0.62 mg\/ml in Fig. 1B (i) and 1.55 mg\/ml in Fig. 1B (ii) ). These results suggest that both density and dimensions of the adsorbed collagen fibers are highly proportional to the initial concentrations of the native collagen solution.\r\n To examine the detailed structures of native collagen, images of films at lower collagen concentrations (from 0.1 mg\/ml to 0.62 mg\/ ml) in a 5 mm \u00c2 5 mm scan area were taken. As shown in Fig. 1B (ivevi), these surfaces were covered with thin filaments (w50 nm in diameter, shown, blue arrows) that evenly dispersed. In addition, the density of these filaments depended on the initial concentration of the native collagen solution as well. Moreover, filaments seemed to provide anchors for fibrils whose diameter was gradually narrowing to the diameter of filaments in the end site as indicated by green arrows, similar to the previous findings [12, 13] .\r\n In contrast, the nanostructures of the denatured collagen films showed less dependence on initial concentration and film thickness. With the scan area of 50 mm \u00c2 50 mm, the morphologies of denatured collagen films appeared relatively featureless (Fig. 1C (i)e(iii)). The features were almost identical to the image of the bare TCPS (Fig. 1C (iv) ), indicating that the adsorbed collagen homogenously covered the surface and only few accumulates appeared (red arrows in Fig. 1C (iii) ). Within the scan area of 5 mm \u00c2 5 mm, no thin filaments were observed even at the highest denatured collagen concentration of 3.88 mg\/ml (Fig. 1C (v) ), except some small aggregates of denatured collagen molecules (w10 nm in diameter). These data suggest that once the collagen solution was denatured with heat and acid, collagen monomers were no longer able to self-assemble into collagen fibrils in collagen films regardless of its concentration.\r\n To identify the colonies carrying the characteristics of stem cells on collagen surfaces with different treatments, we immunostained the cells cultured on native and denatured collagen samples. Our previous study has proved that the pulmonary epithelial stem cells express markers of Oct-4, stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1), stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1) and cytokeratin-7 [2] . The cells cultured on collagen films (native, 3.88 mg\/ml) and (denatured, 3.88 mg\/ml) were shown side by side (Fig. 2) . Colony cells on the native collagen films expressed Oct-4 in the nuclei whereas the surrounding cells were negative (Fig. 2AeC) . For cells on collagen (denatured, 3.88 mg\/ml) (Fig. 2DeF) , the same expression patterns were displayed. The identical results were found in other native and denatured samples with different initial concentrations. The findings showed the feasibility of the cultivation of pulmonary stem colonies for the following examination on collagen films with additional pretreatment.\r\n In order to study the effects of native and denatured collagen films on colony formation, the numbers and sizes of colonies on each sample were analyzed based on the following method as shown in Fig. 3 . First, the number of colonies on each sample was counted over a fixed area of 78.5 mm 2 . Secondly, the colonies on TCPS were grouped into three categories: fewer than 25 cells (bars in red), 25e100 cells (bars in green), and 100e250 cells per colony (bars in blue). Thirdly, to estimate the total stem cell counts in each sample, we derived an approximate value of individual total colony cell number from a weighted mathematical method. The median of each category, N i , was estimated as the weighted value, e.g. N i \u00bc 175 for category of 100e250; N i \u00bc 62.5 for category of 25e100; N i \u00bc 12.5 for category of <25. The total cell number of each category, N t , was obtained from multiplying N i by the colony number, C i , in that category as N t \u00bc N i \u00c2 C i . The sums of the weighted N t values of three categories for each sample are shown in Fig. 3A with the numbers indicated on the right-side y-axis. For the native collagen film samples, there was a rapid decrease in both colony numbers and sizes when the initial collagen solutions increased from 0.04 mg\/ml to 3.88 mg\/ml. However, for the denatured collagen samples, there was no dependence on the concentrations in stem cell colony counts (Fig. 3A) . As comparing the colony size and number of colony cells cultured on TCPS without collagen coating, we observed the promotion of the stem cell growth resulting from the presence of collagen molecules. Phase contrast images of primary cell cultures on collagen films are presented in Fig. 3B . The flat and high spreading stromal cells surrounded the cluster of stem cells that slightly lose optical focus under microscope observation due to their round up shapes.\r\n Overall, the quantities of stem cell colonies on all denatured collagen films were consistently abundant compared with those on the native collagen film samples, and the correlation with their thicknesses was not found. The sizes of the stem cell colonies formed on all denatured collagen film samples were larger than those on the native collagen films with higher initial collagen concentrations of 0.25e3.88 mg\/ml. The surface difference as tracked by a surface profiler and AFM suggests that the nano-texture of collagen surfaces was the dominant factor regarding colony formation and existence in primary cultures. The presence of abundant collagen fibers apparently restricts the density and size of stem cell colonies.\r\n To understand how surface nanostructures can determine cell growth, the primary cultures were prepared on films of collagen (native, 3.88 mg\/ml), (denatured, 3.88 mg\/ml), and bare TCPS, respectively. First, the stromal cell morphologies on each sample were observed by immunostaining (in green), together with the optical phase contrast images. Cell spreading of the stained cells with a-smooth muscle actin was markedly decreased and formed a constrictive shape on the native collagen film (Fig. 4A) , compared with cells on the denatured collagen surface (Fig. 4B ). It appears that the spreading of stromal cell was constrained on the collagen supramolecule structured film.\r\n We also observed stromal cells spreading on a TCPS (two cells leaned against each other in Fig. 4C ). Without collagen coating, the cell area of stroma was smaller than that on the denatured collagen films, which may be due to the absence of adhesion-promoting molecules on TCPS [16e18]. Moreover, we examined stem cell morphologies under identical culture conditions. The shape and size of the individual colony cell appeared similar on native and denatured collagen and TCPS surfaces. All colony cells appeared to be spherical shapes that are not fully spread on surfaces, which is similar to the morphology found in other stem cells [19, 20] . Conceivably, the lack of adhesiveness of the colony cells might be the reason that their morphologies are not influenced by the collagen nanostructures as much as those of stromal cells.\r\n In order to further understand the interactions among supporting substrates, stromal cells and pulmonary stem cells upon different collagen nanostructures, the pulmonary colony cells were isolated from the primary cell culture. The sorting experiment was accomplished by collecting the cells with specific surface markers, CXCR4 and CD54, on a flow cytometry followed by re-seeding on the films (native, 3.88 mg\/ml and denatured, 3.88 mg\/ml). In addition, the sorted colony cells were incubated in DMEM with 10% FBS (Fig. 5A and C) and in serum-free MCBD-201 medium (Fig. 5B and D). After incubation for 7 days, the sorted cells were immunostained with Oct-4 to examine the preservation of the stem cell function. In the serum-containing DMEM, sorted cells expressed the Oct-4 marker and cell population became independent of the underlying collagen nanostructures (Fig. 5A and C) . In contrast, in the original serum-free MCDB-201, the self-renewal ability of sorted cells was restrained and cells underwent differentiation (Fig. 5B  and D) . Our observation showed that in the case of sorted colony cells, cell fate is determined by medium components as opposed to collagen nanostructures.\r\n Stem cells are highly controlled by specific microenvironments known as \"niches\" in vivo and, hence, substantial advances in cell culture methodology and understanding of ECM in vitro are essential to lead to enormous potential of stem cells. This study investigated the characterization of air-dried native and denatured collagen films on the TCPS plates, and showed the alteration of pulmonary epithelial stem and stromal cells on these films with different nanostructures. Moreover, through the isolation of stem cells, we further studied the behaviors of colony cells in the selfrenewal and differentiation which indirectly outlines the function of stromal cells.\r\n Dupont-Gillain and co-workers have demonstrated that collagen organization varies with the properties of adsorbed surfaces, absorption duration, drying conditions and initial collagen concentration [21e25]. Different levels of fibrillogenesis were defined [26] . Filaments, formed from the linear assembly in a temperature-dependent initiation [27] , are approximately 50 nm in diameter; fibrils, formed from the lateral assembly of filaments [27] , are approximately 200 nm in diameter; and supramolecules, formed by fibril twists, are approximately up to 0.5 mm in diameter.\r\n In this study, the degree of collagen assembly on native collagen films was controlled by the initial concentration. We operated all processes on standard TCPS plates by air-drying in a sterile hood, differing from the previous studies [12, 13, 24, 25] . Our modified protocol enables the routine duplication of desirable collagen nanostructures from filaments, fibrils, to supramolecules, in a regular biological laboratory.\r\n The heat-denatured collagen films, consisting of random coils unable to undergo filament assembly [14] , exhibited no fibrillar collagen, except for some round-shaped aggregates discovered at high concentrations (0.62e3.88 mg\/ml, Fig. 1C (ieiii)) [12, 13] . Through utilizing knowledge of film preparation techniques and characterization of surface properties, we are able to control the film thickness and nanostructure. This allows us to tackle the correlation of collagen structures with cell growth in a complicated primary culture system.\r\n Cell shape and function are profoundly affected by the ECM, both during development and in the adult organism [28] . Ling et al.'s previous study has demonstrated that lung epithelial colony cells were fond of type I collagen and expressed stem cell markers, including Oct-4 SSEA-1, Sca-1 and cytokeratin-7 in a serum-free selective culture system [2] . Furthermore, the cells surrounding the epithelial colonies were stained positively for a-smooth muscle actins, which are considered as a marker of mesenchymal cells. In this study, we utilized the Oct-4 marker, a typical marker of pluripotency for both mouse and human embryonic stem cells [29] (Fig. 2) and a-smooth muscle actins (Fig. 4) . Results indicate that cells cultured on both native and denatured collagen films do not alter the gene expression of Oct-4 and a-smooth muscle actins, suggesting the constancy in the pulmonary primary cell culture, and the nature of both colony cells and stromal cells can be maintained.\r\n A disease named idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is known to cause distortion of alveolar architecture, progressive decline in lung function and finally death [30] . It was understood to be concurrent with fibroblast accumulation, excessive collagen deposition and matrix remodeling. Recent studies have implicated insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in stimulation of collagen production and down-regulation of collagenase production [31] . In the present study, we systematically altered collagen quantity and fibrillar structures to observe the influences on pulmonary stem cells, which can undergo terminal differentiation into alveolar type 2 and type 1-like pneumocytes [2] . Although we could not provide direct evidence regarding the role of pulmonary stem cells in the disease, it is convincing that ECM remodeling should sufficiently modulate the subsequent tissue repair events by regeneration of stem cells. While cells were confluent on the native collagen-coated TCPS plate, colony density and size were both highly dependent on collagen fiber quantity. In contrast, stem cell colony density and size were consistently abundant on the denatured collagen that is analogous to the matrix metalloproteinase-treated collagen in vivo [32] (Fig. 3A) . One would think that cell responses might be affected by collagen film bulk thickness. However, from the set of statistical colony cell numbers on denatured collagen films (Fig. 3A) , the colony cell population did not depend on thickness (Fig. 1A) . Hence, the effect of thickness on colony formation could be eliminated in this experiment, and the nanostructures of topmost collagen films are the important criterion for primary cell activities. It is clear that the adhesion and self-renewal of colony cells can be restricted on the fibrilabundant collagen films. In the meantime, on the native collagen films consisting of filaments and supramolecules, stromal cells have low-spreading and disorganized cytoskeletal stress fibers (Fig. 4A) . It is well known that integrins are responsible for the activation of growth-promoting signaling pathways as well as anchorage requirements, therefore cell survival and spreading are governed by integrin-mediated recognition sites [33, 34] . Keresztes and co-workers reported that the space distribution of the fibrillike collagen's recognition sites may interfere with the organization of the cell-surface receptors [35] . Additionally, the other studies have also shown that SMCs failed to thrive when cultured on polymerized fibrillar collagen, which reflects the regulation of Cdk2 inhibitors [10, 12, 13] . For these reasons, we hypothesize that stromal cells play a crucial role in stem cell colony development. Moreover, in the cultivation of pre-sorted colony cells without stromal cells, we found that while cell fate is unaffected by collagen film nanostructures but impacted by medium components. Therefore, serum should be an alternative to functions of stromal cell for colony cell self-renewal (Fig. 5AeD) . It is known that niche cells underlying a basement membrane signal to stem cells to regulate differentiation and division in vivo. Proliferation, differentiation and survival of distinct progenitor populations in the hematopoiesis were discovered to depend on interactions with neighboring cells [36e40] . Similarly, secreted factors from niche cells play an instructive role in the differentiation of neural crest stem cells [41] . Thus, in this study, by utilizing manipulated nanostructures of collagen films, we further reveal that the growth of Oct-4 \u00fe pulmonary epithelial colony cell population is arrested by the effects of the degree of collagen polymerization on adjacent mesenchymal stromal cells. These observations reflect that the ability of renewal of pulmonary epithelial stem cells may in turn be prohibited by the excessive production of collagen from fibroblasts as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis arises in alveolae in vivo.\r\n In this study, the correlation between pulmonary stem cells and their niches was examined by altering collagen thickness, nanostructures and medium conditions independently in both primary and pre-sorted colony cultures. Collectively, fibrillar collagen inhibits proliferation of pulmonary stem cells. This should be attributed to the regulating mechanisms through the interaction between the neighboring mesenchymal stromal cells and the surface nanostructured collagen films, rather than to the contact of stem cell with collagen surfaces and the bulk material properties in films. This is further evidenced by the fact that in a pre-sorted stem cell culture colony formation is independent on the textures of type I collagen, but only dependent on the presence of serum. This research is a step towards comprehending the relationship between the nanostructures of type I collagen and primary neonatal pulmonary cells, and provides insights into potential influences during collagen accumulation in vivo.","sha":"4615051fd7d1bae4ffa5ec9b8227e6bd84d6cd3f","publish_time":"2010-11-30","authors":"Huang, Chun-Jen; Chien, Yi-Lun; Ling, Tai-Yen; Cho, Huan-Chien; Yu, John; Chang, Ying-Chih","journal":"Biomaterials","doi":"10.1016\/j.biomaterials.2010.07.038","Title":"Biomaterials","H index":337.0,"transmission_indicator":true,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"We have recently identified a rare subpopulation of lung colony cells with the characteristics of pulmonary stem cells, and discovered that stem cell colonies grew preferentially on type I collagen films in a serum-free medium.

Stem cells are of great potential in molecular biology research and regenerative medicine [1] . discovered a rare subpopulation of pulmonary cells at bronchoalveolar junctions of lung tissues, exhibiting slow cycling and Octamer-4 (Oct-4 \u00fe ) expressing [2] . A collagen monomer consists of three left-handed helices which arrange to an extended superhelix with roughly 1.5 nm in diameter and 300 nm in length. For example, the fibrillar structures of type I collagen have led to distinctive changes in gene expression, population, and morphological profiles of cultured smooth muscle cells (SMCs) [10e13]. Further mechanistic study suggested that native collagen suppresses cyclin E-associated kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) phosphorylation while increasing levels of the Cdk2 inhibitors p27 Kip1 and p21 Cip1\/waf1 . We have characterized the surface thin film morphology, the fibrillar formation, and the film thickness with atomic force microscopy (AFM), and surface profiler. Moreover, the cultivation of pre-sorted colony cells allowed us to observe the exclusive interaction between colony cells and type I collagen films. The correlation among stem cells, stromal cells and biomaterials is revealed by monitoring the number and size of colonies and performing immunohistochemical staining for Oct-4 and a-smooth muscle actin. The lung pieces were soaked overnight in Joklik's minimum essential medium (JMEM; SigmaeAldrich) with 0.1% protease type-XIV (SigmaeAldrich) at 4 C. Subsequently, they were transferred to 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)\/JMEM, pipetted several times to release pulmonary cells and then filtered through a 100-mm nylon cell strainer. The cells were incubated in 5% CO 2 at 37 C for eight days, and then the colony was examined for quantification. To prepare the denatured collagen, original rat-tail type I collagen (w4 mg\/ml) was mixed with 0.4 M acetic acid, 10\u00c2 DPBS in a 16:1:2 ratio. The collagen concentration was then adjusted to 3.88 mg\/ml with 10\u00c2 DPBS. The surface area of the well bottom was 1.9 cm 2 . 180-ml collagen solutions with initial concentrations of 0, 0.016, 0.04, 0.1, 0.25, 0.62, 1.55 and 3.88 mg\/ml were dispensed and covered the well surfaces. AFM images of collagen thin films were recorded in air using the MFP-3D-BIO AFM (Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA). Before scanning, the collagen samples were rinsed with DI water to remove salts, and dried overnight in a laminar flow sterile hood. Applied force, scan speed, sampling rate and scan length were 1 mg, 20 mm\/s, 200 Hz and 1000 mm, respectively. To prepare the surface for measurement, a thin stripe was taped to the polystyrene plate in advance to prevent partial surface contact with the collagen solution. The numbers of colonies with the comprising cell number ranges of below 25, between w25 and w100, and between w100 and w250 were counted separately. The colony cell isolation protocol was developed as previously reported [2] with the following modification. A quantity of 1 \u00c2 10 7 cells was collected from the primary culture after an 8-day incubation and washed in PBS, 3% FBS. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with a Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (7.5 mg\/ml, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 30 min at 4 C and then washed with PBS, 3% FBS. The pulmonary stem cells were sorted on a FACS-Vantage-SE flow cytometry system (BD). The thickness of both native and denatured collagen films was measured by a surface profiler. As the initial concentration was increased to 1.55 mg\/ml, fibrillar collagen of w200 nm in diameter appeared, and supramolecular collagen (approximately 1e2 mm in diameter, black arrow in Fig. In contrast, the nanostructures of the denatured collagen films showed less dependence on initial concentration and film thickness. With the scan area of 50 mm \u00c2 50 mm, the morphologies of denatured collagen films appeared relatively featureless (Fig. 2DeF) , the same expression patterns were displayed. The median of each category, N i , was estimated as the weighted value, e.g. N i \u00bc 175 for category of 100e250; N i \u00bc 62.5 for category of 25e100; N i \u00bc 12.5 for category of <25. The sums of the weighted N t values of three categories for each sample are shown in Fig. 3A with the numbers indicated on the right-side y-axis. As comparing the colony size and number of colony cells cultured on TCPS without collagen coating, we observed the promotion of the stem cell growth resulting from the presence of collagen molecules. Phase contrast images of primary cell cultures on collagen films are presented in Fig. To understand how surface nanostructures can determine cell growth, the primary cultures were prepared on films of collagen (native, 3.88 mg\/ml), (denatured, 3.88 mg\/ml), and bare TCPS, respectively. 4A) , compared with cells on the denatured collagen surface (Fig. Without collagen coating, the cell area of stroma was smaller than that on the denatured collagen films, which may be due to the absence of adhesion-promoting molecules on TCPS [16e18]. In the serum-containing DMEM, sorted cells expressed the Oct-4 marker and cell population became independent of the underlying collagen nanostructures (Fig. This study investigated the characterization of air-dried native and denatured collagen films on the TCPS plates, and showed the alteration of pulmonary epithelial stem and stromal cells on these films with different nanostructures. Different levels of fibrillogenesis were defined [26] . Our modified protocol enables the routine duplication of desirable collagen nanostructures from filaments, fibrils, to supramolecules, in a regular biological laboratory. In this study, we utilized the Oct-4 marker, a typical marker of pluripotency for both mouse and human embryonic stem cells [29] (Fig. Recent studies have implicated insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in stimulation of collagen production and down-regulation of collagenase production [31] .

Peritoneal ventilation has long been desired for extrapulmonary oxygenation owing to easy access of the peritoneal cavity for catheterization and the relative safety compared to an extracorporeal circuit. Unfortunately, prior attempts involving direct oxygen ventilation or aqueous perfusates of fluorocarbons or hemoglobin carriers have failed, leading many researchers to abandon the method. We attribute these prior failures to limited mass transfer of oxygen to the peritoneum and have designed an oxygen formulation that overcomes this limitation. Using phospholipid-coated oxygen microbubbles (OMBs), we demonstrate 100% survival for rats experiencing acute lung trauma to at least 2 h. In contrast, all untreated rats and rats treated with peritoneal oxygenated saline died within 30 min. For rats treated with OMBs, hemoglobin saturation and heart rate were at normal levels over the 2-h timeframe. Peritoneal oxygenation with OMBs was therefore shown to be safe and effective, and the method requires less equipment and technical expertise than initiating and maintaining an extracorporeal circuit. Further translation of peritoneal oxygenation with OMBs may provide therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome arising from trauma, sepsis, pneumonia, aspiration, burns and other pulmonary diseases.","text_body":"Severe hypoxemia arising from lung injury is life-threatening in critically ill patients. Mechanical ventilation may be inadequate owing to limited mass transfer in the injured lung; overinflation, barotrauma and cyclic closing and reopening of the alveoli may further damage the lung and trigger a pulmonary and systemic inflammatory reaction that may lead to multiple system organ failure [1] . Researchers have long sought a safe and effective method for extrapulmonary oxygenation to treat these patients.\r\n Currently, the last resort for treating pulmonary failure uses extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a temporary artificial extracorporeal support of the respiratory system and\/or cardiac system [2] . ECMO was first used in an adult in 1972 to treat severe respiratory failure [3] and in 1974 on the first newborn [4] . Innovations in ECMO include the introduction of polymethylpentene hollow fibers with nonthrombogenic coatings and thin wire-reinforced cannula walls. ECMO use has historically centered on neonatal care [5] . Recently, the H1N1 flu pandemic led to wider use of ECMO, proving its utility in hypoxemic emergencies.\r\n Alternative therapies are required, however, because ECMO is correlated with significant complications associated with the mechanically powered external blood circuit [2, 6] . Thrombosis and other deleterious factors are common results. To mitigate these problems, anticoagulants (heparin) are administered to the patient, often with additional adverse effects. Intracranial brain hemorrhage is an unpredictable and lethal complication of ECMO that occurs in w5% of patients [2, 7, 8] . Additionally, ECMO is expensive and complex to operate, limiting its accessibility for emergency care.\r\n Thus, researchers have focused on other methods of extrapulmonary respiration, such as peritoneal oxygenation. Peritoneal oxygenation uses the large surface area of the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity, as a gas exchanger. The main advantages of peritoneal oxygenation are easy access for catheterization; relative safety of circulating oxygen through the peritoneal cavity, in which the mesothelium acts as a gaspermeable barrier between the perfusate and the blood; and avoidance of extracting and reintroducing blood. The technique is analogous to peritoneal dialysis, a simple, low-tech form of renal replacement therapy that is less expensive and complex than conventional in-center hemodialysis [9] .\r\n The most obvious method is to mechanically ventilate the peritoneal cavity with pure oxygen gas. This method was first proposed almost a century ago [10] . Perhaps the most successful application of mechanical ventilation of the peritoneal cavity was reported by Barr et al. [11, 12] , who showed an increase in arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO 2 ) and decrease in mortality rate for a lung injury model compared to pulmonary mechanical ventilation alone. The same group later showed improved outcome from peritoneal mechanical ventilation therapy in a hemorrhagic shock model [13] . In a subsequent large animal study, however, peritoneal mechanical ventilation showed no increase in mixed venous PO 2 [14] . A more recent study in rabbits suffering a tracheal clamp showed only a moderate increase in survival time from 5.0 min for no treatment to 6.5 min for peritoneal mechanical ventilation [15] , supporting claims of low clinical utility.\r\n Prior peritoneal oxygenation studies introducing aqueous perfusates, such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and red blood cells (RBCs), into the intraperitoneal space have reported no effect or only a mild increase in PaO 2 [15e20]. Prior to our study, the most successful application of peritoneal oxygenation used liposomal synthetic hemoglobin carrier TRM-645, which produced a mean increase in rat cardiac arrest time following a right pneumothorax from 9 to 33 min [20] .\r\n Here we report on a new method of peritoneal oxygenation, in which we use OMBs designed for high oxygen carrying capacity, high oxygen delivery rate and sufficient stability for storage and transport. This follows a recent study by Kheir et al. [21] , which showed a limited but significant therapeutic benefit from the intravenous injection of OMBs in rabbit hypoxic ventilation and tracheal clamp asphyxiation studies. The intravenous route appears to be a promising method for short-term rescue, but the prolonged continuous infusion of oxygen microbubbles into the bloodstream poses significant challenges for clinical translation, including the potential for embolism, thrombosis, immunogenicity and toxicities of lipid and saline load.\r\n Our approach of direct systemic oxygenation by injecting OMBs into the peritoneal space is a radical change from existing oxygen delivery platforms. The procedure and apparatus for circulating OMBs through the peritoneal cavity is simple and straightforward, and the therapy precludes the need for an extracorporeal loop to circulate blood, thus potentially circumventing the complications from thrombosis and intracranial hemorrhage presented by ECMO. In this study, we examined the utility of peritoneal oxygenation with OMBs to increase mean survival time of rats experiencing a right pneumothorax lung injury, a common model for pulmonary failure that has been used in prior studies to examine the efficacy of peritoneal oxygenation.\r\n All solutions were prepared using filtered, 18 MU cm \u00c01 deionized water (Direct-Q, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Glassware was cleaned with 70 vol% ethyl alcohol solution (SigmaeAldrich; St. Louis, MO) and rinsed with deionized water. Phospholipid 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) was purchased from NOF (Tokyo, Japan), and polyoxyethylene-40 stearate (PEG-40S) was purchased from SigmaeAldrich (St. Louis, MO). Phosphate buffered saline used for the control experiments was assumed to have neutral PaO 2 tension relative to atmosphere, and thus was \"oxygenated\" considering the PaO 2 in venous and arterial blood.\r\n DSPC and PEG-40S were weighed in dry form, combined to a 9:1 M ratio, and dissolved into a 0.2-mm filtered solution of 0.15 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a final lipid concentration of 12 mg\/mL. The mixture was heated to 65 C and dispersed using a Branson 450 sonifier (Danbury, CT) with an output power of 5\/10 until the solution was translucent. The resulting solution was stored in a refrigerator prior to microbubble synthesis. Oxygen microfoam was prepared by adapting the process design developed by Swanson et al. [22] for synthesizing large volumes of oxygen microbubbles. The process consisted of an ultrasonic horn reactor enclosed in a water-cooled, continuous-flow chamber (Branson, Danbury, CT). The lipid suspension was fed at 5 C and combined with room temperature oxygen gas in the reactor at roughly equal volumetric flow rates. The oxygen gas was emulsified at full sonication power and then fed to a flotation column to separate the oxygen microbubbles (bottom) from the macrofoam (top). Oxygen microbubbles were immediately collected from the bottom of the column using 60-mL syringes and centrifuged (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) at 110 relative centrifugal force (RCF) for 4 min to form a w70 vol% concentrate. The concentrated oxygen microfoam was then transferred to 500-mL Wheaton serum bottles (Pasadena, TX), sealed under an oxygen atmosphere, and stored in the refrigerator. The infranatant lipid suspension from the centrifugal wash was collected and recycled into the sonication process to produce more microfoam. The process was repeated until the desired volume of 70 vol% oxygen microfoam was produced. Oxygen microbubble size distribution was determined using the electrozone sensing method (Coulter Multisizer III, Beckman Coulter, Opa Locka, FL). Oxygen gas volume fraction was determined by subtracting the weight of a fixed volume of microfoam from the weight of the same volume of aqueous medium (10 mg\/mL lipid in PBS), and dividing this difference by the weight of the same volume of aqueous medium. Gas headspace purity in the serum bottle was determined using a model 6600 precision headspace gas analyzer (Illinois Instruments Inc, Johnsburg, IL).\r\n The objective of this study was to test our hypothesis that oxygen microbubbles delivered by intraperitoneal infusion can significantly increase the mean survival time of an animal experiencing acute lung injury, in comparison to an intraperitoneal infusion of oxygenated saline solution. The research subjects were male Wistar rats (n \u00bc 10, mass \u00bc 430 AE 15 g, Charles River), housed 2 per cage and acclimated for 4 days with free access to food and water. We performed a controlled laboratory study to test the therapeutic benefit of an intraperitoneal infusion of oxygen microbubbles in rats experiencing acute lung injury. Right pneumothorax was chosen as an appropriate model for acute lung injury based on prior work reported in the literature [20] . Two treatments were applied: oxygen microbubbles or oxygenated saline control. Following induction of pneumothorax, we observed vital signs and measured intraperitoneal pressure, infused volume, rectal temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ). The animals were randomly assigned to cages by the caretakers, and the animals were randomly chosen for treatments. No additional blinding was done in the study. The number of animals used in this study was determined from work by Matsutani et al. [20] and a preliminary feasibility study. In Matsutani, a synthetic oxygen carrier was injected into the intraperitoneal (IP) space of rats for the purpose of systemic oxygenation. The mean standard deviation and mean effective size were 6.9 and 19.9, respectively [20] . We assumed the same standard deviation, but half the effective size (m \u00c0 m 0 \u00bc 10). Using these values, a target Type I error of 0.05 and a sample size of 6 rats per group yielded a power of 0.81. In our preliminary feasibility study, a sample size of 4 rats was used in the oxygen microfoam group, and 3 rats were used in the control group. Using the Logrank test for comparison of the survival distribution (a \u00bc 0.05), a significant difference was found between the two groups (X 2 \u00bc 6.624, P \u00bc 0.010). Based on these results, it was decided that a sample size of 5 rats per group would be adequate for the lung injury study. Data collection was stopped due to either cardiac arrest or achievement of the primary endpoint. Additional criteria were established to allow for the exclusion of samples where complications arose. Criteria for exclusion included the occurrence of unsuccessful pneumothorax or infrequent data points being collected by the veterinary monitor. One rat from the control group was excluded from the study because both exclusion criteria occurred in the trial. No other data were excluded. No test for outliers was used; all data were included in the study. A primary endpoint of 2 h following induction of pneumothorax was selected to avoid complications arising from animal recovery from anesthesia and the initial lung injury. We sometimes observed these complications in animals living more than 2 h in our preliminary feasibility study. We calculated that the 2-h endpoint would be sufficiently long to demonstrate a statistically significant increase in mean survival time between animal receiving our therapy and the control group. Prior to our study, the longest mean survival time for an intraperitoneal oxygenation therapy following pneumothorax reported in the literature was w33 min [20] ; thus, a mean survival time exceeding 2 h was deemed a significant improvement over the current state of the art and of high clinical utility. No other endpoints were specified. No replicates were performed. Each animal received only one pneumothorax and one treatment.\r\n All animals were housed and underwent procedures approved by the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male Wistar rats (n \u00bc 10, mass \u00bc 430 AE 15 g, Charles River) were anesthetized in an induction chamber with 5% isoflurane to effect and maintained on 2% isoflurane. Each rat was weighed, given an IP injection of sodium pentobarbital solution (50 mg\/kg dose), and then placed in the supine position on a warming pad (T\/pump Classic, Gaymar) set at 38 C to maintain body temperature. After the rat was fully sedated and unresponsive to pain delivered by paw pinches, a small incision into the skin was made to expose the fascia of the abdominal wall. A 12-gauge indwelling catheter was then inserted into the IP cavity and fitted to tubing (3.2 mm inner diameter, Tygon) by a Luer lock for subsequent infusions. A 22-gauge indwelling catheter was also inserted into the IP cavity and connected to two pressure transducers (4426-005G, Measurement Specialties Inc.) for measuring intra-abdominal pressure via a data acquisition system (myDAQ, LabVIEW, National Instruments). A veterinary monitor (SurgiVet Advisor, Smith's Medical) was used to monitor vitals. A pulse oximetry sensor (V3078, Smith's Medical) was clipped to the hind leg of the rat to measure the pulse rate and arterial oxygen hemoglobin saturation (SaO 2 ). A temperature probe (WWV3418, Smith's Medical) was placed rectally for monitoring body temperature. A bolus of perfusate was pumped through a fluid warmer (iWarm, Midmark) set at 40.4 C and into the IP space with a peristaltic pump (Thermo Scientific, FH100M) at 40 mL\/min for 1 min, and then at 8 mL\/min thereafter. At this time, the rats experienced a right pneumothorax by perforating the pleura of the pulmonary cavity with a scalpel. Infusion lasted until distension of the abdomen was noticeable, and the total infused volume of perfusate was recorded. The fluids used as a perfusate were saline as the control and oxygen microfoam (70 vol% O 2 gas volume fraction).\r\n During the experiment, temperature, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) of the blood was monitored in 8-s averages and recorded every 30 s for each rat. The intra-abdominal pressure was monitored and recorded at a frequency of 10 samples per second. Survival time was measured as the elapsed time between right pneumothorax and cardiac arrest. If still living, the rat was given a second dose of sodium pentobarbital 1 h following the administration of the previous dose. The endpoint of data collection occurred when the rat had suffered functional cardiac arrest or when the predefined endpoint of 2 h of survival time was reached. At 2 h plus 5 min, any surviving rats were euthanized by isoflurane overdose.\r\n KaplaneMeier survival curves (Fig. 3a) were created with a sample size of 5 rats per group for a representation of the survival rate for the control and oxygen microfoam groups. A Log-rank (Mandel-Cox) test was done to compare the survival distribution of the oxygen microfoam group to the control group for a significant difference (a \u00bc 0.01). It was found that there was in fact a significant difference between the two groups (X 2 \u00bc 9.701, P \u00bc 0.002).\r\n We designed oxygen microbubbles to comprise a phospholipid coating stabilizing a microscopic bubble of oxygen gas (Fig. 1a) . Our design was chosen to mimic the naturally occurring surfactant that lines the lung alveolus [23] , which is primarily composed of diacyl phosphatidyl-choline (PC). Saturated PC lipids self-assemble at the gas\/water interface to form a 3-nm thick monomolecular layer that can be compressed to achieve very low interfacial tensions [24] , which is necessary to avoid premature microbubble dissolution [25] . We chose distearoyl PC (DSPC) as the main lipid component because it provides an optimal tradeoff between in-plane rigidity to stabilize microbubbles for long durations in storage [26] and relatively low gas permeation resistance [27] . The lipid monolayer is permeable to oxygen and other gases, so the bubble is in continuous diffusive exchange with surrounding dissolved gases [28] . While highly permeable, the lipid shell modulates gas exchange by resisting monolayer expansion and compression beyond the closepacked lipid configuration at the microbubble resting radius [29] . We also chose a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) conjugated lipopolymer with a matching stearate lipid anchor as an emulsifying agent to improve yield by promoting lipid adsorption onto newly formed oxygen microbubbles and inhibiting microbubble coalescence. Self-consistent field theory calculations indicate that under these conditions the PEG chains form a w10-nm thick hydrated brush layer [30] , which can lead to very high repulsive pressures between closely approaching microbubbles [31] . The PC\/PEG shell comprises only w1% of the total microbubble volume, but is essential for stabilizing the microbubbles against coalescence and dissolution.\r\n Oxygen microbubbles were prepared by adapting the process design developed by Swanson et al. [22] for synthesizing large volumes of concentrated (w70 vol%) microfoam (Fig. 1bec) . OMBs were synthesized and stored in sealed 500-mL serum bottles for storage and transport (Fig. 1d) . The microbubbles were stable to several days of storage and interstate transport for animal studies. The OMBs were polydisperse in size (Fig. 1e) , with a numberweighted mean diameter of 3.4 AE 1.9 mm (mean AE SD) and a volume-weighted mean diameter of 7.7 AE 4.2 mm. 90% of the total gas volume was contained in microbubbles with diameters less than 14 mm.\r\n Pneumothorax to the right lung of the rat was chosen as an appropriate model for in vivo lung trauma based on prior studies. The right lung of the rat is composed of four lobes, whereas the left lung consists of a single lobe [32] . Thus, damage to the right lung can cause a drastic reduction in oxygen intake and respiratory function. Previous studies in rats have shown that the volume of the right lung is approximately 60% of the total lung volume [33] , and collapse of the right lung by pneumothorax is fatal [20] . In this study, male Wistar rats (n \u00bc 10, mass \u00bc 430 AE 15 g) were anesthetized and placed in the supine position on a warming pad (Fig  2a) . After the rat was fully sedated and unresponsive to pain delivered by paw pinches, perfusate and pressure sensor catheters were surgically inserted into the peritoneal cavity. A pulse oximeter sensor was clipped to the hind leg to measure pulse rate and arterial oxygen hemoglobin saturation (SaO 2 ), and a temperature probe was placed rectally to monitor body temperature. A bolus of perfusate was pumped through a fluid warmer and into the peritoneal cavity with a peristaltic pump at 40 mL\/min for 1 min, and then at 8 mL\/min thereafter. The perfusion fluids were oxygenated saline as the control and OMBs (70 vol% O 2 gas volume fraction). At this time, the pleura of the pulmonary cavity was perforated with a scalpel to give the rat a right pneumothorax, and an examination was performed to determine whether oxygenation through peritoneal infusion of OMBs could avoid the onset of hypoxemia and extend life.\r\n Oxygen was delivered from OMBs by diffusive transport through the peritoneum into the adjacent blood and tissue of the abdominal wall and internal organs (Fig. 2b) . Infusion lasted until distension of the abdomen was noticeable. The total infused volume of OMBs was 107 AE 9 mL, which was not statistically different from the saline control (Fig. 2c) . The intra-abdominal pressure was maintained at less than 0.6 kPa gauge throughout the experiment for animals treated with both saline and OMBs (Fig. 2d) . Following pneumothorax, the mean temperature was 34.5 AE 0.8 C for animals receiving OMBs and 33.0 AE 1.0 C for those receiving saline (Fig. 2e) . These temperatures were below the normal temperature range of rats (35.9e37.5 C) [32] , but were unlikely a significant factor in causing death [34e36] .\r\n Peritoneal infusions of OMBs produced 100% survival to the predetermined 2-h endpoint in rats experiencing a right pneumothorax, compared to a median survival time of only 18.5 min for oxygenated saline and 15.5 min for untreated controls (Fig. 3a) . Oxygen saturations were observed to be in the normal range throughout the 2-h timeframe for animals treated with OMBs, while they dropped precipitously within minutes for those treated with saline control (Fig. 3b) . Furthermore, heart rate was also observed to be in the normal range over the 2 h for animals treated with OMBs, while it dropped rapidly within minutes for the controls treated with saline (Fig. 3c) .\r\n The OMBs used in this study were designed for high oxygen carrying capacity and rapid oxygen delivery to the peritoneum. A 70 vol% suspension of OMBs at 1.0 bar and 37 C contains an estimated 0.88 mg-O 2 mL \u00c01 , compared to 0.31, 0.62 and 0.57 mg-O 2 mL \u00c01 for blood, liposomal hemoglobin and pure PFC, respectively [18, 20] . Furthermore, OMBs provide a greater fraction of oxygen availability to the body. The entire mass of oxygen can be released to low-oxygen surroundings because complete microbubble dissolution is thermodynamically favorable, whereas the finite solubility of oxygen in PFC, or the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, restricts complete oxygen release from these formulations.\r\n However, if available oxygen carrying capacity was the only criterion for successful peritoneal oxygenation, then ventilation with pure oxygen (1.26 mg-O 2 mL \u00c01 ) should not have failed to provide clinically relevant oxygenation, as reported by Giffin et al. [14] . We attribute the limited uptake for pure oxygen ventilation to the problem with injecting a bolus of free gas into the peritoneal cavity. Surface area is minimized owing to the high surface free energy (w73 mJ\/m 2 ) of the gas\/water interface. Thus, one may compare the transport of a centimeter-scale bubble for pure oxygen ventilation to hundreds of billions of micrometer-scale bubbles for OMBs. The transport process from the bubble to the bulk fluid occurs via three steps (Fig. 4a) : (i) diffusion from the bulk gas to the inner surface of the lipid monolayer shell, (ii) diffusion through the lipid monolayer shell and absorption into the liquid phase and (iii) diffusion in the liquid from the bubble surface to the bulk. The mass transport resistance for diffusion from the gas to the surface (R gas ) is estimated from kinetic theory to be approximately 10 \u00c05 s\/cm [37] and is independent of microbubble size assuming zero tension in the lipid shell [24] . The shell resistance to oxygen permeation (R shell ) has been measured to be approximately 10 2 s\/cm [27] , which is larger than 1.2 s\/cm predicted by a statistical thermodynamics calculation for absorption at a clean oxygen gas\/liquid animals treated with OMBs survived to the 2-h endpoint and were subsequently euthanized as directed by the IACUC protocol. The median survival times for untreated animals and those treated with oxygenated saline were 15.5 (n \u00bc 6) and 18.5 min (n \u00bc 5), respectively. Thus, OMB infusion significantly increased survival time compared to saline control (P \u00bc 0.0039, unpaired two-tailed t-test using the 125 min endpoint for OMBs). (b) Animals treated with OMBs had an SaO 2 between 80% and 90%, as measured by a paw-cuff pulse oximeter. SaO 2 rapidly declined for animals treated with saline control. (c) The heart rate for animals treated with OMBs was 240e 350 bpm immediately following the right pneumothorax and increased to 300e 350 bpm throughout the experiment. Animals treated with saline control experienced a rapidly declining heart rate. The pulse oximeter could read up to a maximum heart rate of 350 bpm.\r\n interface [38] . The mass transfer resistance for diffusion in the liquid (R bulk ) for a purely diffusing sphere is given as [39] :\r\n where R is the bubble radius and D is the diffusivity of oxygen in water. A plot of the three transport resistances shows that diffusion in the liquid dominates the transport process for larger bubbles, but begins to approach that of the shell for microbubbles (Fig. 4b) . Thus, the oxygen flux from microbubbles to the peritoneum approaches the physical upper limit for gas absorption through a lipid monolayer. In addition to increasing the oxygen transfer coefficient (k L ), OMBs provide an increase in interfacial area per unit volume (a \u00bc 2.10 \u00c2 10 4 cm 2 mL \u00c01 for 70 vol% of 8-mm diameter OMBs) compared to a 1-cm diameter ventilation bubble (a \u00bc 4.20 cm 2 mL \u00c01 ). This gives an estimated volumetric transport coefficient (k L a) of 45 s \u00c01 for OMBs compared to 2.1 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 s \u00c01 for a ventilation bubble. The total oxygen transport rate is equal to the product of the volumetric transport coefficient and the concentration gradient between the gas phase and the peritoneum. Thus, OMBs provide a much higher overall oxygen delivery rate to the peritoneum, providing a plausible explanation as to why OMBs are successful in peritoneal oxygenation where pure oxygen ventilation has failed.\r\n The achievement of 100% survival to 2 h for our lung injury model, in which the median survival time for saline controls was only 18.5 min, indicates a potential clinical utility for patients suffering mild to severe hypoxemia where mechanical ventilation is inadequate or injurious. In neonates, for example, the method could be used to treat hypoxemia arising from meconium aspiration syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, sepsis and cardiac anomalies [5] . More research will be needed to determine if microbubble peritoneal oxygenation can also be used to treat patients suffering from lung diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), avian flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or breathing complications, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\r\n There were some limitations to our study. First, there was some concern that the pneumothorax lung injury model would cause death, not from gas exchange failure, but from increased oxygen demand from work of breathing, cardiogenic failure from altered venous return in a depressurized thorax, or from another unanticipated complication due to the wound. The success of microbubble peritoneal oxygenation in prolonging life in all five animals suggests that these complications are secondary to the need for rapid oxygen delivery.\r\n A general limitation of peritoneal oxygenation is that in humans only about 20e30% of the systemic blood supply circulates through the portal and hepatic circuits and therefore only a fraction of the blood would be oxygenated [40] . More research must be done to investigate microbubble peritoneal oxygenation in larger animals where the ratio of the peritoneal area to total body mass is closer to humans. To mitigate this limitation, other serous membranes could be perfused to increase the surface area for O 2 transfer. For example, it may be possible to circulate OMBs through the intrapleural space. This limitation underscores the necessity of efficient O 2 transfer between the perfusate and the serous membrane, and as shown in this work, OMBs provide high O 2 carrying capacity and rapid diffusion capability.\r\n Another limitation to our study was that we only employed a one-way delivery of oxygen, but did not simultaneously remove carbon dioxide, which may ultimately result in complications such as hypercapnia and acidosis. Further work must be done to extend the technology for circulation, removal and replenishment of the OMBs in the peritoneal cavity. We do not view these engineering challenges as major obstacles for ultimate clinical translation given the precedent set by methods of peritoneal dialysis. Prior to translation, however, the technology must be examined in other acute lung injury models, such as inhalation injury and aspiration injury.\r\n Oxygen microbubbles were designed for stability in storage and transport, high oxygen carrying capacity (0.88 mg-O 2 mL \u00c01 ) and rapid diffusion capability (k L a \u00bc 45 s \u00c01 ). Peritoneal oxygenation with oxygen microbubbles produced 100% survival to the 2-h endpoint for rats suffering a right pneumothorax lung injury, whereas untreated and saline-treated controls had a median survival time of only 18.5 min and 0% of these animals survived to the 2-h endpoint. These results suggest a potential clinical utility for patients suffering mild to severe hypoxemia where mechanical ventilation is inadequate or injurious. Fig. 4 . Oxygen transport from a microbubble. (a) Oxygen gas molecules must pass through a series of three resistances to enter the bulk fluid phase of the peritoneal cavity, including diffusion from the gas to the shell (R gas ), diffusion through the lipid shell and absorption into the liquid (R shell ) and diffusion to the bulk liquid (R bulk ). The diagram shows the relative concentrations. (b) A quantitative comparison of the three mass transfer resistances versus bubble radius at 25 C and 1 bar. R gas and R shell are independent of bubble size, and R gas is approximately six orders of magnitude less than R shell . R bulk is computed for a purely diffusing sphere; it dominates for large bubbles but approaches R shell for microbubbles. The shaded region represents the OMB size range comprising 90% of the total gas volume, showing that the main mass transport limitation for these microbubbles is diffusion through the lipid shell.\r\n Attending Veterinarian, Dr. Kelly Heath and Veterinary Technician, Holly Reiling, as well as the Institutional Animal Care staff who helped us establish expertise in performing the procedures and for procuring, housing and caring for the animals used in this study.

Recently, the H1N1 flu pandemic led to wider use of ECMO, proving its utility in hypoxemic emergencies. Thrombosis and other deleterious factors are common results. The main advantages of peritoneal oxygenation are easy access for catheterization; relative safety of circulating oxygen through the peritoneal cavity, in which the mesothelium acts as a gaspermeable barrier between the perfusate and the blood; and avoidance of extracting and reintroducing blood. The most obvious method is to mechanically ventilate the peritoneal cavity with pure oxygen gas. Prior peritoneal oxygenation studies introducing aqueous perfusates, such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and red blood cells (RBCs), into the intraperitoneal space have reported no effect or only a mild increase in PaO 2 [15e20]. Prior to our study, the most successful application of peritoneal oxygenation used liposomal synthetic hemoglobin carrier TRM-645, which produced a mean increase in rat cardiac arrest time following a right pneumothorax from 9 to 33 min [20] . 21] , which showed a limited but significant therapeutic benefit from the intravenous injection of OMBs in rabbit hypoxic ventilation and tracheal clamp asphyxiation studies. Phospholipid 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) was purchased from NOF (Tokyo, Japan), and polyoxyethylene-40 stearate (PEG-40S) was purchased from SigmaeAldrich (St. Louis, MO). DSPC and PEG-40S were weighed in dry form, combined to a 9:1 M ratio, and dissolved into a 0.2-mm filtered solution of 0.15 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a final lipid concentration of 12 mg\/mL. The mixture was heated to 65 C and dispersed using a Branson 450 sonifier (Danbury, CT) with an output power of 5\/10 until the solution was translucent. 22] for synthesizing large volumes of oxygen microbubbles. Gas headspace purity in the serum bottle was determined using a model 6600 precision headspace gas analyzer (Illinois Instruments Inc, Johnsburg, IL). Right pneumothorax was chosen as an appropriate model for acute lung injury based on prior work reported in the literature [20] . No additional blinding was done in the study. Using the Logrank test for comparison of the survival distribution (a \u00bc 0.05), a significant difference was found between the two groups (X 2 \u00bc 6.624, P \u00bc 0.010). Additional criteria were established to allow for the exclusion of samples where complications arose. Each animal received only one pneumothorax and one treatment. All animals were housed and underwent procedures approved by the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. After the rat was fully sedated and unresponsive to pain delivered by paw pinches, a small incision into the skin was made to expose the fascia of the abdominal wall. A veterinary monitor (SurgiVet Advisor, Smith's Medical) was used to monitor vitals. A pulse oximetry sensor (V3078, Smith's Medical) was clipped to the hind leg of the rat to measure the pulse rate and arterial oxygen hemoglobin saturation (SaO 2 ). A bolus of perfusate was pumped through a fluid warmer (iWarm, Midmark) set at 40.4 C and into the IP space with a peristaltic pump (Thermo Scientific, FH100M) at 40 mL\/min for 1 min, and then at 8 mL\/min thereafter. Infusion lasted until distension of the abdomen was noticeable, and the total infused volume of perfusate was recorded. The fluids used as a perfusate were saline as the control and oxygen microfoam (70 vol% O 2 gas volume fraction). 3a) were created with a sample size of 5 rats per group for a representation of the survival rate for the control and oxygen microfoam groups. We chose distearoyl PC (DSPC) as the main lipid component because it provides an optimal tradeoff between in-plane rigidity to stabilize microbubbles for long durations in storage [26] and relatively low gas permeation resistance [27] . Oxygen microbubbles were prepared by adapting the process design developed by Swanson et al. [ OMBs were synthesized and stored in sealed 500-mL serum bottles for storage and transport (Fig. The microbubbles were stable to several days of storage and interstate transport for animal studies. Previous studies in rats have shown that the volume of the right lung is approximately 60% of the total lung volume [33] , and collapse of the right lung by pneumothorax is fatal [20] . In this study, male Wistar rats (n \u00bc 10, mass \u00bc 430 AE 15 g) were anesthetized and placed in the supine position on a warming pad (Fig  2a) . Peritoneal infusions of OMBs produced 100% survival to the predetermined 2-h endpoint in rats experiencing a right pneumothorax, compared to a median survival time of only 18.5 min for oxygenated saline and 15.5 min for untreated controls (Fig. Furthermore, heart rate was also observed to be in the normal range over the 2 h for animals treated with OMBs, while it dropped rapidly within minutes for the controls treated with saline (Fig. Furthermore, OMBs provide a greater fraction of oxygen availability to the body.

Despite improved diagnostics, pulmonary pathogens in immunocompromised children frequently evade detection, leading to significant mortality. Therefore, we aimed to develop a highly sensitive metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) assay capable of evaluating the pulmonary microbiome and identifying diverse pathogens in the lungs of immunocompromised children.\r\n Methods. We collected 41 lower respiratory specimens from 34 immunocompromised children undergoing evaluation for pulmonary disease at 3 children's hospitals from 2014-2016. Samples underwent mechanical homogenization, parallel RNA\/DNA extraction, and metagenomic sequencing. Sequencing reads were aligned to the National Center for Biotechnology Information nucleotide reference database to determine taxonomic identities. Statistical outliers were determined based on abundance within each sample and relative to other samples in the cohort.\r\n Results. We identified a rich cross-domain pulmonary microbiome that contained bacteria, fungi, RNA viruses, and DNA viruses in each patient. Potentially pathogenic bacteria were ubiquitous among samples but could be distinguished as possible causes of disease by parsing for outlier organisms. Samples with bacterial outliers had significantly depressed alpha-diversity (median, 0.61; interquartile range [IQR], 0.33-0.72 vs median, 0.96; IQR, 0.94-0.96; P < .001). Potential pathogens were detected in half of samples previously negative by clinical diagnostics, demonstrating increased sensitivity for missed pulmonary pathogens (P < .001).\r\n Conclusions. An optimized mNGS assay for pulmonary microbes demonstrates significant inoculation of the lower airways of immunocompromised children with diverse bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

Despite improved safety of antineoplastic and transplantation-based therapies, the risk of infectious complications such as pneumonia remains high [4, 5] . Due to the inhibitory effect of antimicrobial pretreatment on culture growth, impaired serologic immunity, and the limited preselected targets of multiplex assays, current microbiologic diagnostics frequently fail to identify pathogenic organisms [6] . The significant mortality associated with undiagnosed pulmonary infections is evident in postmortem case series of pediatric HCT patients, in whom previously undetected pulmonary pathogens have been identified in 30%-50% [7] .\r\n Unlike assays that target the 16S and\/or 28S\/ITS ribosomal RNA amplicons, unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) can detect bacteria, viruses, and fungi and has shown promising results for diagnosing neurologic and ocular infections [8] [9] [10] . However, the identification of filamentous molds such as Aspergillus spp. remains difficult due to thick extracellular matrices and the relatively small inoculum required to induce disease [11] [12] [13] [14] . Unfortunately, off-the-shelf assays for respiratory biospecimens have proven inadequate to survey the variety of organisms present in thick and mucoid respiratory secretions. As such, unlike the better-characterized microbiomes of the human gastrointestinal tract and nasopharynx, data describing the composition of the pulmonary microbiome are sparse and insufficient to reliably discriminate between health and disease [15] .\r\n Therefore, we conducted a pilot study aimed to develop a highly sensitive mNGS assay capable of detecting myriad pulmonary bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens and to test that assay on a retrospective cohort of immunocompromised children who underwent lower respiratory tract sampling as evaluation for suspected pulmonary infection. We hypothesized that an optimized mNGS assay could improve characterization of the pulmonary microbiome and identify potential pulmonary pathogens in this high-risk population.\r\n We created mock-positive bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) by spiking Aspergillus niger broth into aliquots of BAL containing known Haemophilus influenzae\/Human Adenovirus B coinfection (Supplementary Material 1). An Aspergillus species was chosen as an optimization benchmark given its thick polysaccharide cell wall and extreme clinical importance of invasive mold in this patient population [16] .\r\n We tested nucleic acid extraction conditions by combining 200 \u03bcL of mock-positive BAL with either 600 \u03bcL DirectZol, 600 \u03bcL lysis buffer, or 200 \u03bcL DNA\/RNA Shield (Zymo), followed by mechanical homogenization with either 0.1 mm or 0.5 mm glass bashing beads (Omni) for 2, 5, or 8 cycles of 25 seconds, bashing at 30 Hz with 60 seconds rest on ice between each cycle (TissuerLyser II, Qiagen). Samples homogenized in DNA\/RNA shield also underwent enzymatic mycolysis with either 0.15 mg or 0.38 mg proteinase K at 23\u00b0C for 30 or 60 minutes (Zymo) or with 0.4 mg, 1.2 mg, 4 mg, or 8 mg Yatalase (Takara Bio Inc.) at 23\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 60 or 90 minutes. Subsequently, all samples underwent 10 minutes of centrifugation at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was used for parallel DNA\/RNA extraction (Zymo ZR-Duet DNA\/RNA MiniPrep Kit). Aspergillus niger nucleic acid yield was measured using an orthogonal digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay with pan-Aspergillus primers (Supplementary Material 2) [17] . RNA and DNA sequencing libraries were prepared in parallel (New England Biolabs NEBNext Ultra-II Library Prep) and underwent 125 nucleotide paired-end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument (Supplementary Material 3).\r\n Resultant.fastq files were processed using a previously described pipeline that consisted of several open-source components [8, 9] . Briefly, reads underwent iterative removal of host (Hg38\/PanTro), low-quality, low-complexity (Lempel-Ziv-Welch [LZW] compression ratio >0.45), and redundant sequences using STAR, Bowtie2, PriceSeqFilter, and CD-HIT-DUP [18] [19] [20] [21] . The remaining sequences were aligned to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant nucleotide database using GSNAPL for assignment of taxonomic IDs [22] . Microbes were described as potentially pathogenic or typically nonpathogenic based on a priori literature review (Supplementary Material 4).\r\n To assess microbial contaminants in our reagents and laboratory environment, we sequenced 8 control samples containing spiked-in HeLa RNA (Supplementary Material 5).\r\n The prevalence of each microbe in each respiratory sample was described using 2 criteria: abundance relative to other microbes in the same sample, wherein we normalized sequencing reads per million total sequencing reads (rpm), and (2) abundance relative to the same microbe in other samples in the cohort, wherein we normalized sequencing reads as the number of standard deviations above or below the mean log 10 -transformed rpm for the total cohort (Z-score). Given the anticipated wide array of respiratory bacteria and the paucity of knowledge regarding the significance of low-level viruses and fungi, we aimed to maximize specificity for bacterial pathogens and to maximize sensitivity for viral and fungal pathogens [15, 23, 24] . Therefore, we defined microbial outliers as those with Z-score \u22652 and \u226510 rpm (bacteria) or \u22651 rpm (viruses\/fungi). The Simpson diversity index was used to associate the loss of bacterial diversity with the presence of outlier microbes (Supplementary Material 6) [25] .\r\n Respiratory samples with outlier pathogens that were not identified on clinical testing were sent to reference laboratories for orthogonal confirmatory testing (Supplementary Material 7).\r\n To test the optimized mNGS assay, we prospectively screened and approached immunocompromised patients age \u226425 years undergoing clinically indicated lower respiratory sampling between September 2014 and April 2016 at the University of California San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital, Indiana University Riley Hospital for Children, and the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital. Patients were enrolled with consent. After respiratory samples were collected for clinical purposes, excess volume was separated, placed on dry ice within 10 minutes of the original procedure, and banked at \u221270\u00b0C until processing (Supplementary Material 8). This study was approved by each site's institutional review board.\r\n Iterative optimizations demonstrated that mechanical homogenization of BAL using 0.5-mm glass bashing beads for 5 cycles in DNA\/RNA shield without mycolytic enzymes yielded the highest quantity of A. niger nucleic acid (Supplementary Material 9, Supplementary Figure 1a-1d) . This extraction protocol performed similarly when applied to clinical isolates of A. fumigatus (Supplementary Figure 1e) Figure 2 ). However, sequencing simultaneously extracted DNA to the same depth yielded a 10-fold inferior A. niger LLOD (6.13 CFU; 95% CI, 4.16-9.04; paired T test P < .001; Figure 1 ). The optimization did not change the detection of H. influenzae or Human Adenovirus B (T test P = .343 and P = .420, respectively).\r\n Using the optimized protocol described above, we conducted mNGS on 41 clinical samples obtained from 34 patients (Table 1) . Sequencing results are summarized below, with sequencing quality reported in Supplementary Tables 1 and  2 , raw sequencing files available in NCBI dbGaP (https:\/\/ www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/projects\/gap\/cgi-bin\/study.cgi?study_ id=phs001684.v1.p1), and detailed patient results in Appendix 1. Negative controls demonstrated minimal environmental contamination (<1 rpm of pathogenic bacteria and no pathogenic fungi or viruses Supplementary Table 3 ).\r\n The vast majority of taxa derived from bacterial alignments were present at low abundance and in quantities similar across all samples in the cohort. Specifically, 81.7% of bacterial genera were identified at <10 rpm and within 2 standard deviations of the cohort mean (Z-score < 2; Figure 2A ). These included potentially pathogenic bacterial genera such as Escherichia, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Stenotrophomonas, and Streptococcus, which were identified in nearly all samples at levels well above those detected in the negative controls (38, 39, 40, 38, 41 , and 40 of 41 samples, respectively). Conversely, only 0.4% of detected bacterial genera met outlier criteria. These outliers included 10 potentially pathogenic bacteria identified in 13 Figure 3 ).\r\n Relative to bacterial alignments, fungal alignments were significantly less prevalent in the cohort. Further, 92.1% of fungal genera were quantified below 1 rpm ( Figure 2B ). Evidence supporting these alignments is limited by the rarity of the reads themselves. Only 3.4% of fungal genera met outlier criteria; these included potentially pathogenic fungi identified in 7\/41 patient samples (Alternaria, Aspergillus, Candida, Cladosporium, Cryptococcus, Fusarium, and Pneumocystis).\r\n While Aspergillus RNA levels were detectable in 14\/41 patient samples, only 1 was positive for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) by both culture and galactomannan assay ( Figure 2B , labeled). Although the remaining 13 were all culture negative, 12\/13 had received fungicidal or fungistatic anti-Aspergillus pharmacotherapy within 48 hours of sample collection, suggesting that empiric antifungal pharmacotherapy significantly confounds the association between Aspergillus RNA and growth in culture. Aspergillus RNA levels did not correlate with growth in culture (T test P = .148) but demonstrated weak association with BAL galactomannan (P < .001; Supplementary Figure 3 ).\r\n In contrast with bacteria and fungi, a significantly larger portion of RNA alignments to viral genera were present at high abundance, and 30.5% met outlier criteria ( Figure 2C and 2D \r\n Clinical testing identified causative pathogens in 41.4% of samples (n = 17; Figure 4 ). Of these, 11 were concordantly identified as outliers by mNGS, and 3 of these 11 contained outlier quantities of RNA aligning to a second previously undetected potential copathogen (Bocavirus, Corynebacterium, and Influenza-C). An additional 3 were identified by mNGS but were not classified as outliers (2 cases \r\n Statistical approaches to separate commensals from pathogens are inherently imperfect; therefore, we undertook orthogonal validation as an independent means to verify these results. Organisms detected by mNGS but not clinical testing were validated with commercially available Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved assays performed on aliquots of the original unprocessed sample (Supplementary Material 7). All validation tests were concordant with mNGS with 1 exception: 28S\/ITS amplicon DNA sequencing failed to identify C. glabrata in sample 37. For this sample, we confirmed the presence of this organism with 3 separate species-specific reverse-transcription primer sets followed by Sanger sequencing. These data demonstrate that mNGS has significantly greater sensitivity for detecting potential pulmonary pathogens than current clinical diagnostics (McNemar's P < .001).\r\n In this study, we developed and optimized an mNGS assay with adequate sensitivity to identify bacteria, fungi, and both RNA and DNA viruses within the lower respiratory tract of immunocompromised children. In doing so, we identified a rich molecular portrait of the pulmonary microbiome in this vulnerable population. Further, by comparing the quantity of microbial nucleic acid to that of other microbes within a sample and to other samples within the cohort, we were able to identify outlying potential pathogens in approximately half of clinically negative samples. Due to inherent challenges in sampling the lower respiratory tract, the pulmonary microbiome was not one of the original sites studied in the 2008 Human Microbiome Project, and its exploration has lagged decades behind similar analyses of human intestinal, cutaneous, and nasopharyngeal microbiomes [26] . In addition, studies of the pulmonary microbiome in children necessarily lack healthy matched controls due to the inherent risks of anesthesia and bronchoscopy [27] . In this study, we found that many potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Streptococcus are ubiquitous, and hence their abundance needs to be contextualized by cohort-specific norms. For example, 100% of samples had detectable Pseudomonas RNA, but only sample 29 had Pseudomonas RNA detected more than 2 standard deviations above the cohort mean. Normalizing population-dependent measurements is common in pediatrics and appears well suited to describe aspects of the pulmonary microbiome [28] [29] [30] .\r\n To date, the majority of metagenomic sequencing assays have targeted amplicons within the 16S or 28S rRNA subunits, allowing detection of pulmonary bacteria or fungi, but not both, and not viruses [31] . Recently, unbiased mNGS assays have allowed detection of both bacterial and viral nucleic acid but have lacked ideal sensitivity for detecting filamentous mold [11, 12] . Although the European Aspergillus PCR Initiative has described ideal methodology for extracting fungal nucleic acid from blood, the optimal extraction conditions for respiratory specimens remain less well defined [32, 33] . This study confirms the need for aggressive mechanical homogenization in stabilizing media in order to detect molds such as Aspergillus while simultaneously preserving the detection of bacteria and viruses [34] [35] [36] . As the majority of commercial sequencing assays measure DNA, this study adds to the literature by demonstrating that RNA sequencing is >10 times more sensitive for the detection of such fastidious organisms, which we speculate may be due to high copy numbers of particular RNA templates present in active organisms [37] .\r\n Using optimized mechanical homogenization, Aspergillus RNA was detected in 34.1% of samples and no negative controls, suggesting that the lungs of immunocompromised children are frequently exposed to low levels of potentially viable Aspergillus organisms. These data are novel in the pediatric population and are congruous with surveillance data from neutropenic and nonneutropenic adults [38, 39] . However, as only 10% of samples originated from patients with suspected IPA, patient-specific factors such as antifungal pretreatment, immune reconstitution, alloreactive inflammation, and impaired mucociliary clearance remain crucial in determining which child might develop IPA [16] . While this study was not powered to assess performance characteristics of this assay for IPA, pan-fungal and Aspergillus-specific PCR have demonstrated 76%-79% sensitivity and 93%-95% specificity for probable\/proven IPA [14, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . Combining nucleic acid tests with galactomannan can hasten diagnosis and improve clinical outcomes in some populations [48] [49] [50] [51] ; further, incorporation of immune function may also improve discrimination of colonization and invasive mycosis [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . Importantly, for all nucleic acid-based tests, measurable Aspergillus yield varies among species and according to life stage, cell wall characteristics, and hydrophobicity [57] . Therefore, any future clinical mNGS assay will need to be benchmarked against numerous Aspergillus species as well as other medically relevant fungi in order to have the broadest utility. Consistent with emerging data in pediatrics, we also detected herpesviruses such as CMV and HHV-6 in low abundance among many children in the cohort [58, 59] . Interestingly, a number of typically nonpathogenic viruses such as Torquetenovirus and KI Polyomavirus were present in more than half of the cohort. While data supporting the direct pathogenicity of these viruses are lacking, they may indicate immune dysfunction and predict numerous post-transplant infectious and alloimmune complications [60] [61] [62] . Future studies aimed at characterizing longitudinal changes in the pulmonary virome of immunocompromised children are warranted.\r\n By characterizing the distribution of pulmonary microbes within the cohort, we identified statistically outlying potential pathogens in half of clinically negative samples. Most newly detected cultivable organisms were isolated from patients who had been pretreated with antimicrobials, highlighting the importance of culture-independent techniques [15] . In addition, several newly detected viruses were not included in clinical multiplex PCR assays (Human coronavirus, Human Bocavirus, Influenzavirus-C) [63] . While this study suggests that many idiopathic pulmonary complications may be associated with infections, one quarter of samples were concordantly negative for pathogens on clinical and mNGS testing, emphasizing the ongoing significance of noninfectious pulmonary complications in this population. Future clinical validation of mNGS may demonstrate utility in safely excluding infections and allowing amplified immunomodulation in patients with predominantly inflammatory pulmonary syndromes [64] . Our study has several strengths. First, we optimized the extraction of Aspergillus spp. RNA while preserving detection of bacterial and viral nucleic acid. Second, we proposed a logical analytical framework that ranks organism abundance both within a sample and relative to other samples. Third, outlier pathogens identified by mNGS that were not detected clinically were subsequently validated by orthogonal assays. Fourth, we provide, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of the pulmonary microbiome in immunocompromised children.\r\n Our study has several limitations. First, while the Z-score was useful in deemphasizing commonly abundant organisms (ie, S. pneumoniae), it may have overvalued uncommon organisms with less abundant transcripts (ie, CMV); additional larger studies will naturally strengthen the utility of Z-score analyses. Second, because the relationship between microbe quantity and sequencing reads varies across organisms based on nucleic acid accessibility and the availability of annotated reference genomes, future clinical application of an mNGS assay will require validation on numerous clinically relevant species. Third, samples with abundant nucleic acid from human epithelial cells, leukocytes, viruses, and other sources may have reduced detection of sparse or fastidious microbes. Finally, as with all mNGS assays, the identification of microbial nucleic acid does not directly confirm the presence of viable, live organisms; does not directly implicate that microbe as a contributor to pulmonary disease; and does not exclude less abundant organisms as potential contributors to pulmonary disease. Future studies are needed to determine whether prospective use of mNGS in a clinically relevant time frame might affect patient management and improve outcomes. In order to optimize patient outcomes, we advocate for ongoing multidisciplinary collaboration among clinicians, laboratory scientists, and bioinformaticians.\r\n In summary, we present an optimized mNGS assay that revealed a rich bacterial, fungal, and viral pulmonary microbiome in immunocompromised children and identified potential pathogens in half of clinically negative samples. As such, advanced organism detection offers the potential for early implementation of targeted therapy and the possibility for improved clinical outcomes in immunocompromised children. We invite the scientific and clinical community to participate in an ongoing multicenter collaborative clinical trial aimed at further refining this emerging technology [65] .\r\n Supplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.

Due to the inhibitory effect of antimicrobial pretreatment on culture growth, impaired serologic immunity, and the limited preselected targets of multiplex assays, current microbiologic diagnostics frequently fail to identify pathogenic organisms [6] . However, the identification of filamentous molds such as Aspergillus spp. As such, unlike the better-characterized microbiomes of the human gastrointestinal tract and nasopharynx, data describing the composition of the pulmonary microbiome are sparse and insufficient to reliably discriminate between health and disease [15] . We hypothesized that an optimized mNGS assay could improve characterization of the pulmonary microbiome and identify potential pulmonary pathogens in this high-risk population. We tested nucleic acid extraction conditions by combining 200 \u03bcL of mock-positive BAL with either 600 \u03bcL DirectZol, 600 \u03bcL lysis buffer, or 200 \u03bcL DNA\/RNA Shield (Zymo), followed by mechanical homogenization with either 0.1 mm or 0.5 mm glass bashing beads (Omni) for 2, 5, or 8 cycles of 25 seconds, bashing at 30 Hz with 60 seconds rest on ice between each cycle (TissuerLyser II, Qiagen). Aspergillus niger nucleic acid yield was measured using an orthogonal digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay with pan-Aspergillus primers (Supplementary Material 2) [17] . Respiratory samples with outlier pathogens that were not identified on clinical testing were sent to reference laboratories for orthogonal confirmatory testing (Supplementary Material 7). To test the optimized mNGS assay, we prospectively screened and approached immunocompromised patients age \u226425 years undergoing clinically indicated lower respiratory sampling between September 2014 and April 2016 at the University of California San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital, Indiana University Riley Hospital for Children, and the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital. This study was approved by each site's institutional review board. Iterative optimizations demonstrated that mechanical homogenization of BAL using 0.5-mm glass bashing beads for 5 cycles in DNA\/RNA shield without mycolytic enzymes yielded the highest quantity of A. niger nucleic acid (Supplementary Material 9, Supplementary Figure 1a-1d) .

Relative to bacterial alignments, fungal alignments were significantly less prevalent in the cohort. Further, 92.1% of fungal genera were quantified below 1 rpm ( Figure 2B ). Aspergillus RNA levels did not correlate with growth in culture (T test P = .148) but demonstrated weak association with BAL galactomannan (P < .001; Supplementary Figure 3 ). Further, by comparing the quantity of microbial nucleic acid to that of other microbes within a sample and to other samples within the cohort, we were able to identify outlying potential pathogens in approximately half of clinically negative samples. To date, the majority of metagenomic sequencing assays have targeted amplicons within the 16S or 28S rRNA subunits, allowing detection of pulmonary bacteria or fungi, but not both, and not viruses [31] . Using optimized mechanical homogenization, Aspergillus RNA was detected in 34.1% of samples and no negative controls, suggesting that the lungs of immunocompromised children are frequently exposed to low levels of potentially viable Aspergillus organisms.

Finally, new and current strategies that can overcome the inhibitory effects of respiratory secretions are discussed.","text_body":"Respiratory gene therapy is considered for the treatment of a variety of lung diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF), asthma, emphysema, lung cancer, \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin deficiency and surfactant protein-B (SP-B) deficiency [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Additionally, DNA vaccination via the respiratory tract may also be of interest for certain infectious diseases [6, 7] . Recently, the delivery of siRNA containing nanoparticles to the lungs has also gained much attention for the treatment of lung infections caused by e.g. SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) or (avian) influenza viruses [8] . However, it is known that lung infections may, as in CF patients, lead to the production of purulent respiratory secretions. These altered secretions may drastically lower the number of siRNA molecules that can reach their target cells in the lung.\r\n Depending on the respiratory disease and the therapeutic goal the target cells in the lung can vary from epithelial cells, alveolar cells, macrophages, respiratory stem cells or endothelial cells. All these cell types, except the latter two, can be directly accessed via inhalation or instillation of nucleic acid containing nanoparticles (NANs). These delivery routes have as advantage that they exclusively target the lungs and thereby prevent that NANs end-up in non-target tissues. Additionally, by playing around with the diameter of the aerosol droplets it is possible to direct the disposition of the NANs to the tracheobronchial (4-7 \u00b5m droplet diameter) or alveolar region (1-3 droplet diameter \u00b5m) [9] . Nevertheless, systemic administration is still the best delivery route if the NANs need to transfect the endothelial cells of capillaries that supply blood to e.g. lung tumors. Respiratory stem cells are interesting targets for genetic diseases like CF [10] . However, NANs can only reach these respiratory stem cells after opening of the tight junctions between epithelial cells or alveolar cells.\r\n The therapeutic efficiency of nucleic acid delivery to the lungs depends on the capacity of the NANs to overcome the different barriers towards respiratory gene therapy. To be effective, NANs have to (1) withstand the shear forces during nebulization, (2) overcome the mucus layer that covers the conducting airways, or the liquid layer in the alveoli, (3) overcome antibodies and macrophages (if they are not the target cells), (4) enter the target cells and (5) escape from the endosomes. Additionally, if the therapeutic nucleic acids are genes than the NANs or genes also have to enter the nucleus. In this review we will focus on the extracellular barriers encountered by pulmonary delivered NANs on their way to epithelial cells, pneumocytes and lung macrophages. It is not the goal of this review to discus the other barriers mentioned above or to summarize the outcome of all in vivo experiments or clinical trials in the field of respiratory gene therapy. The latter has been covered by some recent reviews [1, 3, 4] . To allow the reader to gain insights into the mechanism by which extracellular fluids in the lungs may affect the performance of NANs we will start the review with a brief introduction to the biochemical and physical properties of especially respiratory mucus and alveolar fluid. This part will be followed with an overview and discussion of the scientific papers that deal with the behavior of NANs in the different extracellular secretions present in the respiratory tract. Most of the efforts in respiratory gene therapy have focused on CF gene therapy. Therefore, special attention will be given to the extracellular barriers in CF gene therapy. CF is the most common lethal autosomal-recessive disorder in Caucasians, affecting approximately 1 in 2000 newborns, and is characterized by the presence of tenacious mucus in the lungs, intestines and vagina [11] . However, fifteen years of pre-clinical and clinical research, using both viral and non-viral NANs, has revealed that the delivery of the CFTR gene to the lung epithelium of CF patients is a very difficult task. Extracellular barriers play an important role in the failure of CF gene therapy. In the last part of this review we will discuss the strategies that have been evaluate to overcome the different extracellular barriers in respiratory gene therapy. Additionally, we will also suggest new strategies that may enhance the success of respiratory gene therapy.\r\n The air we daily inhale contains besides gas also dust, toxic substances and pathogens. Therefore, the lungs have developed ingenious mechanisms to remove and\/or neutralize these alien materials. One of the most important defense mechanism against these inhaled materials is respiratory mucus, which lines the respiratory epithelium from the nose to the terminal bronchioles [12] . This mucus layer lays on the tips of the cilia which bath in a periciliary fluid layer. Inhaled materials are captured in this blanket of mucus and are together with the mucus continuously transported by the cilia to the esophagus. The physical properties of respiratory mucus determines the efficiency of this mucociliary clearance mechanism [13] . Indeed, in lung diseases characterized by very tenacious mucus the mucociliary clearance is impaired and elimination of mucus occurs via coughing [14, 15] . The thickness of the mucus layer depends on the location in the airways and the presence of a pathologic condition. Although very difficult to determine, it has been reported that in non-pathological conditions the thickness varies between 10 and 30 \u00b5m in the trachea and between 2 and 5 \u00b5m in the bronchi [16, 17] . However, other reports claim that the thickness of the mucus layer can vary between 5 and 260 \u00b5m [18] . In CF and other respiratory diseases the mucus layer is much thicker [19] .\r\n Respiratory mucus is mainly composed of a three-dimensional network of cross-linked mucin chains which gives the mucus viscoelastic properties [20] [21] [22] . The Globlet cells and submucosal glands are the producers of these mucins. Mucins are built up by 4 to 5 subunits which are bound together head-to-tail by intramolecular disulfide bridges ( Fig.1 ) [23] . The subunits, which have a length of about 500 nm, consist of a highly glycosylated protein backbone with non-glycosylated ends [24] . The molecular weight of mucins varies from 2 to 16 MDa. Mucins are negatively charged due to the presence of N-acetylneuramic acids (also called sialic acids) and sulphated monosaccharides in the sugars chains [23, 24] . The latter can contain 1 to 20 sugar monomers and they are covalently linked through O-glycosidic bounds between N-acetylgalactosamine and serine or threonine residues. It is important to realize that each epithelial layer secretes its own characteristic mucins. Therefore, the biophysical characteristics of mucus depend on the location in the body. In the respiratory tract two types of mucins are mainly expressed: MUC5AC and MUC5B [25] . Additionally, it has been found that the glycosylation pattern of these respiratory mucins is altered in CF patients [26] .\r\n The concentration of the different constituents and the physical properties of normal respiratory mucus have not been studied in detail as it is very difficult to collect normal lung mucus. Therefore, Fig. 1 . Schematic representation of human respiratory mucins and their carbohydrate side chains. Mucins consist out of up to 5 subunits attached to each other by disulfide bonds. These subunits are highly glycosylated proteins with non-glycosylated ends. The depicted carbohydrate chain is only illustrative. Ala, Gly, Pro, Thr, Ga, GaN, Gn, and NA correspond respectively to alanine, glycine, proline, threonine, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylneuraminic acid (adapted from Ref. [120] ). many studies were performed on mucus obtained from patients having mucus hypersecretion (e.g. patients with CF and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD)). Nevertheless, in non-pathological mucus the mucin concentration is about 20 g\/l [27, 28] . In CF sputum (i.e. respiratory mucus expectorated by CF patients) slightly lower mucin concentrations have been found [29, 30] (Table 1) . However, higher mucin concentrations (up to 47 g\/l) were found in CF patients that produce very tenacious sputum [31] . Table 1 gives an overview of the concentration of the most abundant compounds in CF sputum. The water content in sputum from CF patients is about 90%, while mucus of healthy individuals contains about 95% water. Besides mucins and water, mucus also contains proteins, lipids, proteoglycans and electrolytes [20, 22, 32] . The major proteins in respiratory mucus are albumin, proteases, anti-proteases, immunoglobulins, lysozyme and lactoferrin [33] . The respiratory secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis or respiratory infections also contain huge amounts of DNA and actin (Table 1 ). These biopolymers are derived from neutrophils, epithelial cells and pathogens that died and subsequently released their intracellular content in the mucus. DNA and actin have like mucins a high molecular weight and can cross-link and thereby form a DNA or actin gel (Figs. 2A and B) [34, 35] . These properties of DNA and actin drastically increase the viscoelasticity of CF mucus. Additionally, mucin, DNA and actin chains can also interact physically (by entanglements) and chemically (by hydrogen bonds, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions) with each other [36, 37] . Interestingly, a tight binding between respiratory mucins and lipids has been reported [38] . Such interaction may make the mucin chains more hydrophobic. These interactions between mucus constituents make (CF) mucus one of the most complex biopolymer networks.\r\n The alveolar epithelium is covered with a thin continuous layer of pulmonary surfactant which comprises phospholipids and specific surfactant-associated proteins and which are synthesized and secreted by type II alveolar cells. The aqueous alveolar subphase lying between the pulmonary surfactant film and the alveolar epithelium has an average thickness ranging from 0.18 \u00b5m above flat alveolar walls to 0.89 \u00b5m in the alveolar corners. The major function of pulmonary surfactant is to reduce surface tension at the air-water interface of the terminal airways, thereby reducing the tendency of alveoli to collapse [39] .\r\n The detailed composition of the pulmonary surfactant was characterized from biochemical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and is composed of lipids (90%) and proteins (10%) [39] . Although the lipids are ultimately responsible for the reduction of the surface tension during inhalation and expiration, surfactant-associated proteins are suggested to assist within this process. About 80% of the lipids are phophatidylcholins (PC). The most abundant PC (50%) is the zwitterionic dipalmitoylphospatidylcholin (DPPC). This PC substantially contributes to the unique properties of pulmonary surfactant [40] . The residual PC in surfactant primarily consists of molecular derivatives containing monoenoic and dienoic fatty acids and minor amounts of short chains or polyunsaturated acyl groups. The acidic and thus negatively charged phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), account for 8-15% of the total surfactant phospholipids. Low levels of phophatidylserine (PS) are also present in BALF. The positively charged phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) accounts for 3-5% of the total surfactant phospholipids. In addition, neutral lipids such as cholesterol are found at varying levels in pulmonary surfactant [40] .\r\n The protein fraction in BALF contains a highly variable amount of serum proteins (50-90% of the total amount of proteins) and proteins specifically expressed from the lungs, among which four surfactant proteins [41] . The surfactant proteins (SPs) have been termed SP-A, -B, -C, and -D. Whereas the hydrophilic surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D play essential roles in pulmonary immune defense, SP-B and SP-C lower the surface tension, facilitate formation and stabilization of the surfactant film. The major proteins found in BALF are albumin (50%), transferrin (5-6%), \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin and immuglobulin A and G (together 30%) [42] . These proteins originate either from plasma or are expressed from the lung tissue. In some cases proteins may be both derived from plasma and secreted from the lung tissue, e.g. \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin [43] . The total protein concentration can only be roughly estimated from the dilution of ALF and is approximately 54 mg\/ml [44] . The concentration of albumin which is the predominant protein in the ALF is approximately 19 mg\/ml. Finally, nucleic acids, mucins and glycoproteins and massive amounts of white blood cells are found in BALF [44] . The viscoelasticity was determined by a rotation rheometer (AR 1000, TA-Instruments) using a cone-plate geometry. Twenty two CF sputa were analyzed and the mean values (\u00b1standard deviations) are shown. BALF also protects the alveoli against pathogens. Indeed, inhaled pathogens can become opsonized by SP-A, SP-D, and immunoglobulins and subsequently eliminated via alveolar macrophages [45] . Therefore, alveolar fluid represents a critical immunological barrier which has to be overcome by NANs before they can bind to the apical membrane of pneumocytes. Additionally, the charged compounds in (B)ALF may also interact with NANs and thereby change their surface properties or even disrupt the NANs. These fatal interactions will be discussed in Section 4.\r\n Three phenomena may prevent that inhaled or intratracheal instillated NANs reach the lung epithelium. First, the biopolymer network that builds up the mucus may hinder the diffusion of NANs by sterical obstruction or by binding the NANs. Second, non-cross-linked (i.e. free moving) (macro)molecules may also bind to the surface of the NANs. The latter can lead to aggregation of the NANs which will further impede their capacity to move through the meshes of the biopolymer network in mucus. Additionally, even when no aggregation occurs, it has been reported that the binding of extracellular compounds to the surface of NANs may drastically decrease their gene transfer capacity [46] . Third, as mentioned above, the mucus blanket is continuously removed via mucociliary transport or coughing. Therefore, the NANs should be able to cross the mucus layer before they are cleared from the respiratory tract. The respiratory cilia transport mucus at a rate of 3.6 mm\/min [47] . However, this speed of mucus clearance may drastically change in pathological situations like cystic fibrosis [48] . Therefore, both the diffusion coefficient of the NANs in the mucus, the thickness of the mucus layer and the rate of mucus clearance will determine whether the NANs will reach the epithelial cells. In this section we will first focus on the transport of NANs, or nanoparticles that are often used as simple models for NANs, through respiratory mucus. Subsequently, the interactions of NANs in respiratory mucus will be discussed. In this review we only considered respiratory mucus, as we expect that the transport and interaction of NANs in other types of mucus is not completely representative for respiratory mucus. For example, the mobility of nanospheres is much lower in cervical mucus than in CF or COPD mucus [49] [50] [51] . Additionally, cervical mucus has another biochemical composition than respiratory mucus and a much lower viscosity than COPD or CF mucus.\r\n Information on the mobility of NANs in respiratory mucus is very scarce. However, polystyrene nanoparticles have been used in several papers to gain insights into the mobility of nanosized drug carriers in respiratory mucus. To our knowledge three groups have so far studied the mobility of nanosized particles in respiratory mucus. The findings of these three groups are reviewed in this section.\r\n Our group evaluated as first the transport of negatively charged (polystyrene) nanospheres and cationic lipoplexes (i.e. complexes of nucleic acids with cationic liposomes) through sputa from CF patients [49, 52, 53] . In these experiments we sandwiched a 220 \u00b5m thick layer of CF sputum between the donor and acceptor side of vertical diffusion chambers ( Fig. 3 ) [49] . The number of nanospheres and lipoplexes transported after 150 min through this CF sputum layer was very low A thin CF sputum layer was placed between the donor and acceptor sides using modified snapwells. Snapwells containing a polycarbonate membrane (pore size 3 \u00b5m) were modified by gluing a 220 \u00b5m thick ring on their borders. This ring was filled with CF sputum and sealed with a second polycarbonate membrane. Finally, the modified snapwell was placed between the donor and acceptor side. The diffusion experiments were started by filling the donor side with nanoparticles or NANs and the acceptor side with buffer. Subsequently the transport of nanoparticles or NANs through the sputum layer was followed by measuring, at the desired time points, their concentration at the acceptor side. (b0.5% of total number of particles present at the donor side) and strongly depending on the size of the particles (Fig. 4) [49, 52] . The transport of 120 nm, 270 nm and 560 nm nanospheres through an equal sized buffer layer was respectively 1.3-fold, 6.8-fold and 42-fold higher than through CF sputum. As the smallest nanospheres were retarded by CF sputum only by a factor of 1.3, we hypothesized that the meshes in CF sputum must be large enough to allow a more or less free passage of these nanospheres. These data also indicate that for small particles (~120 nm) the low transport through the CF sputum is primarily due to the distance (i.e. the thickness of the sputum layer) the particles have to travel. For larger particles (~270 nm) the low transport through CF sputum is due to both the latter phenomenon as well as steric obstruction of the particles by the biopolymer network in CF sputum. The fact that the largest nanospheres (~560 nm) almost do not move through the CF sputum may indicate that most of the meshes between the biopolymers in CF sputum are too small to allow free passage of these nanospheres. Indeed, via scanning electron microscopy we found that CF sputum contains many small meshes (~100 nm), a few meshes 100 and 300 nm, and almost no meshes N500 nm (Fig. 5 ) [49] . Similar mesh sizes have recently been detected in CF sputa via atomic force microscopy (AFM) [37] . The mean mesh sizes (\u00b1standard deviation) determined by AFM in 3 CF sputa were 300 \u00b1 106 nm, 578 \u00b1 191 nm and 711 \u00b1 328 nm [37] . Although, these mesh sizes are larger than the ones derived from the electron microscopy pictures of CF sputum, they are still not large enough to allow completely unhindered passage of 560 nm nanospheres. Finally, we unexpectedly observed that the nanospheres diffused more easily through the most viscoelastic sputa (Fig. 6 ) [49] . To explain this we hypothesized that in highly viscoelastic sputa the higher amount of entangling biopolymers enables the formation of a more heterogeneous macroporous network with meshes that contain a limited number of free biopolymers. The viscosity in these meshes, i.e. the microviscosity, will determine the mobility of nanospheres in CF sputa. Of course the latter only holds true if the nanospheres are small enough to enter the meshes in the sputa. In CF sputa with a low viscoelasticity a more homogeneous microporous network with many free biopolymers in the meshes is probably present. Therefore, the microviscosity in low viscoelastic sputa is probably higher than the microviscosity in high viscoelastic sputa. Hence, nanoparticles in such low viscoelastic sputum will experience a higher viscous drag than in a more viscoelastic sputum. Based on this hypothesis degradation of the biopolymer network in CF sputum by mucolytic drugs may not be the most ideal strategy to enhance transport of nanoparticles through mucus. Indeed, cleave of the biopolymer network will not only increase the mesh size, but also the viscous drag in the meshes between the biopolymers. The latter effect is expected as the cleaved polymer fragments will be released in the meshes of the network. From the perspective of a diffusion particle these two effects are counteracting. The increase in mesh size gives the nanoparticles more 'space' to move through the sputum, but the increasing number of free polymers in the meshes will slow them down. The effects of mucolytic The CF sputum samples were processed as previously described [49] (reproduced from Ref. [49] ). Bar = 0.5 \u00b5m. 7 . Principle of multiple particle tracking. In a MPT experiment a high-speed film is recorded of particles. If the particle size is below the microscope's resolution limit, they are seen as dots of light with a Gaussian intensity distribution. However, with suitable image processing software, one can determine the centre of the particles with very high accuracy, typically in the order of tens of nanometers. By determining the position of the particles in all frames of the MPT film, trajectories can be calculated for each individual particle as shown in A (colored lines). The mean square displacements (MSD) of the trajectories can be used for further quantitative analysis in terms of the mode of motion (free diffusion, directed transport, etc.) and the corresponding quantitative parameters (diffusion coefficient, velocity). In B the trajectories of free-diffusing (red) and confined (green) particles are shown. The graph on the right depicts the corresponding MSD of a particle as a function of lag time. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) agents on the transport of nanoparticles and on the gene transfer capacity of NANs are discussed in more detail in Section 5.1.1.\r\n The group of Justin Hanes used multiple particle tracking (MPT), also sometimes indicated as single particles tracking (SPT), to gain more insights into the diffusion characteristics of individual nanospheres in CF sputum [50, 54] . In MPT the trajectories of about ten nanospheres, that are fluorescent labeled, are simultaneously followed by collecting sequential images with an epi-fluorescence microscope equipped with a fast and sensitive CCD camera [55, 56] (Fig. 7) . After analysis of the images and localization of the nanospheres, it is possible to reconstitute the trajectory of each nanosphere. From this trajectory it is possible to calculate the distance (mean square displacement, MSD) the nanospheres traveled during a certain timeframe. This MSD can be related to the diffusion coefficient through different models, depending on the type of motion. In the work of Dawson et al. the trajectories of negatively charged polystyrene nanospheres of varies diameters (100, 200 and 500 nm as defined by the supplier) was monitored in CF sputum [50] . The average diffusion coefficient of the 100, 200 and 500 nm nanospheres in CF sputum as measured with MPT was 300-fold, 500-fold and 2400-fold lower than in buffer. In the work of Sanders et al. CF sputum caused a much lower retardation of nanospheres [49] . However, it is important to stress that MPT revealed that the transport rates of individual nanospheres in one CF sputum sample showed a very broad distribution. Indeed, a small fraction of the 100 and 200 nm nanospheres showed transport rates that were up to 40-fold higher than the average transport rate of the whole population [50] . Such a fast-moving fraction was not observed with the 500 nm nanospheres [50] . This fraction of highly mobile nanospheres was probably measured in the work of Sanders et al. [49] . The existence of a fraction of nanospheres that can rapidly move through CF sputum may indicate that there are a limited number of consecutive large meshes that form 'transport highways' for the 100 and 200 nm nanospheres. Therefore, it will be crucial that NANs find these channels and do not get lost in too narrow or\/and twisting side roads [51] . Additionally, MPT also detected fluctuations in the speed of an individual nanosphere [50] . This has been attributed to the temporal 'caging' of the nanospheres in region of the sputum where the mesh sizes are too small to allow free diffusion. By studying the trajectories of individual nanospheres in CF sputum the group of Hanes et al. was also able to probe the microviscosity that these nanospheres encountered in the CF sputum [50] . Interestingly, the encountered microviscosity by the 100-and 200 nm nanospheres was respectively 15-and 7-fold lower than the sputum macroviscosity measured with a rheometer. The fact that the 200 nm nanosphere sense a higher apparent viscosity is probably due to a partial steric hinder of these nanospheres by the biopolymer network in CF sputum, as suggested by Sanders et al. [49] . Finally, Dawson et al. also found that negatively charged polystyrene nanospheres bound, probably via hydrophobic interactions; more strongly to the biopolymers in CF sputum than neutral polystyrene nanospheres [50] . Via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) we also found that small polystyrene nanospheres (89 nm as measured via dynamic light scattering) become immobilized in certain regions within CF sputum [57] . Furthermore, coating of these polystyrene nanospheres with polyethylene glycol strongly decreased their binding to biopolymers present in cervical mucus [51] . The binding or interaction of mucus compounds with NANs will be discussed in more detail in Section 3.2.\r\n Finally, the group of Janis Shute et al. used micro-Boyden chambers to study the diffusion of 200 nm negatively charged polystyrene nanospheres in CF sputum [35, 37] . In their experiments they mixed the nanospheres with CF sputum. Subsequently, the sputum with the nanospheres (10 \u00b5l) was transferred to the upper chamber of the diffusion chamber that was separated from the lower chamber (that was filled with 50 \u00b5l of buffer) by a membrane with a pore size of 8 \u00b5m. After 1 h they measured the amount of nanospheres in the lower compartment. Compared to nanospheres mixed with buffer (control), CF sputum caused a 10-to 20-fold decrease in transport [35, 37] .\r\n Non-viral NANs are built up by cationic lipids or polymers, which bind the therapeutic DNA or RNA by electrostatic interactions [58] . The first generation of non-viral NANs also had a positively charged surface. Additionally, it is important to realize that also certain viruses like herpes simplex virus and certain retroviruses have a positive surface charge [59, 60] . Consequently, one can expect that viral NANs based on these viruses will bind via charge interactions to negatively charged components present in mucus. Additionally, other components in mucus like antibodies may interact with NANs [61, 62] . These interaction of NANs with mucus compounds may cause (1) entrapment of the NANs in the mucus, (2) aggregation of the NANs due to neutralization of their surface charges, (3) release of therapeutic DNA\/RNA from non-viral NANs, (4) an inefficient cell binding of the NANs due to shielding of their positive charges or their receptor binding ligands, and (5) endosomal entrapment of NANs. All these effects will strongly impede the gene transfer efficiency of NANs in the presence of mucus. Information on the interactions of NANs with respiratory mucus is scarce. Nevertheless, different researchers reported that negatively charged as well as neutral polystyrene nanospheres bind to filaments present in CF sputum and cervical mucus [51, 57] . This indicates that these negatively nanospheres can adhere to polymer filaments via hydrophobic interactions as these filaments are also negatively charged. Additionally, is has been shown that cationic herpes simplex viruses stick to the mucin filaments present in cervical mucus [63] . All these data indicate that NANs may be prone to interactions with respiratory (CF) mucus. Due to the lack of other reports on this topic we will in this section mainly focus on our data.\r\n We examined the influence of individual CF sputum components and diluted CF sputum on the physicochemical stability and gene transfection activity of cationic DOTAP\/DOPE lipoplexes [31] . Incubation of these lipoplexes with increasing amounts of albumin, linear DNA and mucin decreased and reversed the surface charge of these NANs. This clearly indicates that these negatively charged CF mucus components bind to cationic NANs. Moreover, at the cross-over point from positive to negatively charged lipoplexes we observed a massive aggregation of the lipoplexes and a strong reduction of their gene transfer efficiency. The latter was probably due to a decreased internalization of these large aggregates. Interestingly, higher amounts of albumin and linear DNA created an anionic shield around the lipoplexes that protected them against aggregation. Remarkably, these albumin or linear DNA covered lipoplexes did not have significant decreased gene transfer efficiencies in vitro, although linear DNA, but not albumin, released small amounts of pDNA from the lipoplexes. In contrast, binding of mucins strongly decreased the gene transfer of the DOTAP\/DOPE lipoplexes without causing large aggregates or dissociation of the lipoplexes. This indicates that mucins alter (intra)cellular steps in the transfection process of these lipoplexes. Finally, cationic DOTAP\/DOPE lipoplexes did not or very slightly release pDNA after incubating them with diluted CF sputa obtained from patients with respectively moderated or severe lung infections. In contrast, a massive dissociation of cationic DOTAP\/DOPE lipoplexes was observed when they were incubated with diluted synthetic sputum (i.e. a mixture of albumin, linear DNA, mucin and lung surfactants). It is known that the network structure in CF sputum cannot be simulated by simply mixing of CF sputum constituents. In synthetic sputum the CF sputum components are not well cross-linked and thus more available for fatal interactions with NANs. Similarly, dilution of our CF sputa may have liberated CF sputum components from the polymer network that would otherwise not been able to bind on the surface of the lipoplexes. Consequently, the observed dissociation of NANs in the presence of CF sputum compounds or diluted CF sputum may have generated data that overestimate the potential disintegration of NANs in undiluted CF sputum.\r\n The group of Alton et al. studied the effect of normal respiratory mucus and CF sputum on the gene transfer capacity of lipoplexes, polyplexes and adenoviral vectors [64] [65] [66] [67] . In their first paper they covered cell cultures with a 2 mm thick layer of diluted CF sputum [64] . The least diluted sputa (i.e. 1:1 diluted with culture medium) caused a 20-fold reduction of the gene transfer efficiency of both DC-Chol\/ DOPE based lipoplexes and adenoviral vectors. Strikingly, highly diluted sputa (i.e. 100-fold) also caused a drastic reduction in gene transfer of adenoviral vectors and especially lipoplexes. This indicates that CF sputum is not only a diffusion barrier for NANs, as at such high dilutions the polymer network and sputum viscosity is expected to be disrupted and drastically reduced, respectively. The fact that CF sputum is not only a diffusion barrier was further supported by the observation that removal of the diluted CF sputum, by washing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), before addition of the lipoplexes did not restore the gene transfer capacity of the lipoplexes. Furthermore, incubation of cells with a DNA solution containing N100 \u00b5g\/ml genomic DNA and removal of this DNA solution before lipoplex mediated transfection still caused a 10-fold decrease in gene transfer. Additionally, the capacity of lipoplexes and adenoviral vectors to transfect cells that had been exposed to CF sputum or a DNA solution was respectively partly and completely restored when the cells were incubated with rhDNase before transfection. Consequently, all these observations indicate (1) that DNA present in CF sputum strongly binds to epithelial cell surfaces, (2) that this cell associated DNA drastically limits the gene transfer of both lipoplexes and adenoviral vectors and (3) that rhDNase increases the gene transfer in cells that have been exposed to CF sputum by removing the DNA that became bound to the cell surface.\r\n Later on the group of Alton et al. also evaluated the effect of undiluted CF sputum on the transfection efficiency of NANs [65] . In this study sheep tracheae were covered with a 1.5 mm thick layer of CF sputum and the ability of GL67\/DOPE based lipoplexes and adenoviral vectors to transfect the underlying epithelium was determined and compared to the transfection efficiency in the absence of CF sputum. The efficiency of both NANs was significantly decreased by CF sputum. Surprisingly, adenoviral vectors were much more affected by the CF sputum layer than the lipoplexes. In the presence of CF sputum the gene transfer of lipoplexes and adenoviruses was respectively 5-and 35-times lower (Figs. 8A and B) [66] .\r\n The ex vivo sheep trachea model has also been used to evaluate the effect of normal (sheep) respiratory mucus on the gene transfer capacity of lipoplexes, polyplexes, sendai and adenoviral vectors [66, 67] . Interestingly, these experiments demonstrated that normal respiratory mucus did not represent a barrier to adenovirus and sendai mediated gene transfer, while the gene transfer of both lipoplexes and polyplexes was~30-fold lower in the presence of normal respiratory mucus (Figs. 8C and D) [66, 67] . They hypothesized that this result is related to the differences in surface charges between the non-viral and viral NANs. Indeed, lipoplexes and polyplexes are positively charged and hence more prone to electrostatic binding with mucins than the negatively charged viral vectors. Adenoviruses and sendai viruses seem to possess natural strategies to overcome normal respiratory mucus. This is not surprising as adenoviruses are causing the common cold. Hydrophobic interactions play a role in the formation of a mucin gel [68] . Therefore, it is possible that viruses like adenoviruses have hydrophobic moieties on their surface that can disrupt the hydrophobic cross links between mucins. However, it has been reported that transmembrane mucins, such as MUC1, strongly impedes adenoviral gene transfer [69] .\r\n Finally, we want to remark that in CF patients the amount of inhaled NANs that come in contact with 1 cm 2 of CF sputum will be much lower than the amount of NANs used in vitro by Alton's group and by Sanders et al. [53, 70] . Therefore, one has to realize that the chance that NANs can overcome the CF sputum barrier in vivo is most likely highly underestimate by these in vitro experiments and also by in vivo experiments in mice. Indeed, in the latter experiments the ratio between the administered pDNA dose and lung surface is much higher than can be achieved in CF patients.\r\n Upon topical delivery of NANs to the lung periphery they will encounter the lipids of the pulmonary surfactant layer as the very first endogenous interface in the alveolar region. Therefore, the influence of the pulmonary surfactant lipids on the particle characteristics and their transfection efficiency has been intensively investigated [71] [72] [73] . A general finding of these studies is that the presence of both synthetic and especially naturally derived surfactant preparations results in a dosedependent transfection inhibition of cationic lipid based NANs. In contrast to naturally derived surfactant preparations, such as the commonly used product Alveofact \u00ae , synthetic surfactant preparations (e.g. Exosurf \u00ae ) do not contain surfactant proteins and anionic lipids. It has been reported that especially these negatively charged lipids inhibit gene transfer mediated by cationic lipoplexes [73] . It has been suggested that this inhibitory effect results from disintegration of the lipoplexes by the negatively charged lipids leading to accessibility of the pDNA to nucleases and thus its degradation and loss of function [73] . Therefore, pulmonary surfactant represents a critical barrier which leads to fatal interaction with lipoplexes. Interestingly, NANs derived from cationic polymers such as polyethylenimine (PEI) and dendrimers (PAMAM) have been demonstrated to be more resistant to detrimental effects by pulmonary surfactant. Neither PEI-pDNA nor PAMAM-pDNA complexes were inhibited by naturally derived and synthetic surfactant preparations in vitro [73, 74] and in vivo [75] . However, isolated negatively charged lipids from pulmonary surfactant resulted in comparable transfection inhibition as observed for lipoplexes. Therefore, it has been suggested that this inhibitory effect is compensated by other constituents of naturally derived surfactant, presumably the surfactant proteins, although this requires further detailed investigation [73] . A clear advantage of NANs derived from cationic polymers seems to be their increased complex stability which avoids complex disintegration by the surfactant lipids. Synthetic surfactants such as Exosurf \u00ae have been reported even to increase transfection efficiency of PAMAM-pDNA complexes [74] . These results illustrate that NANs derived from cationic polymers are not subject to fatal interactions with pulmonary surfactant lipids and may therefore be more suitable for gene delivery to the alveolar epithelium in vivo. However, commercial available lung surfactant preparations do not completely represent the liquid layer present in the alveoli. Therefore, Rosenecker et al. studied, via 2-D-gel electrophoresis, the interaction of NANs with the protein fraction present in human BALF. BALF proteins were absorbed more intensively to lipoplexes than to polyplexes [76] . In addition, glycosylated components of the BALF strongly bound to lipoplexes but only weakly to polyplexes. These interactions resulted in a 10-fold increase of the lipoplex diameter and a slight decrease of their surface charge, while the size of polyplexes was not affected but their surface charge changed from positive to negative. In both cases the interaction with the BALF did not lead to NANs disintegration as assessed by quenching assays, which reflects true binding of the BALF components to the NAN's surface. Interestingly transfection inhibition was stronger for polyplexes than for lipoplexes, although the latter were more prone to adsorption of BALF components [76] . A possible reason for this at first view opposing observation could be the loss of the positively charged polyplex surface, which has been suggested to be the precondition to initialize binding to the negatively charged cell surface and subsequent cellular uptake [77] . In summary, these observations demonstrate that both lipids and proteins present in BALF interact with NANs and are responsible for transfection inhibition. Although lipoplexes were generally more susceptible to interactions with BALF components than polyplexes, their transfection efficiency remained, in contrast to polyplexes, relatively unaffected in the presence of BALF.\r\n Overcoming the mucus and alveolar fluid layer in pulmonary gene therapy 5.1. Increasing the mobility of NANs in respiratory mucus\r\n To facilitate their mobility in protective mucus layers certain bacteria, fungi and viruses secrete enzymes that hydrolyze mucins [78] [79] [80] . Therefore, many research groups evaluated the effect of different mucolytic agents, which either degrade actin, DNA or mucin, on the mobility of NANs and nanospheres in (CF) mucus [37, 49, 50, 67, 81] . However, as discussed above mucolytic agents that degraded the biopolymers that build up the three-dimensional polymer network in CF sputum will not only increase the mesh size, but also the viscous drag in the meshes between the cross-linked biopolymers. Therefore, we can expect that the effect of mucolytic agents on the transport of NANs and nanoparticles through especially CF sputum will be limited. However, this does not exclude that mucolytics have a positive effect on the transport of NANs or nanospheres through normal respiratory mucus, which has other biophysical properties than CF sputum. An overview of the reported effects of different mucolytics on the transport of nanospheres and on the gene transfer efficiency of NANs is given below.\r\n Recombinant human DNase (rhDNase) is a clinically used enzyme that liquefies CF mucus by cleaving the DNA chains in CF mucus [82] . RhDNase is administered to CF patients via inhalation. The effect of rhDNase on the mobility of nanoparticles through CF sputum has been studied in only three reports. We showed that the transport of 270 nm polystyrene nanospheres and DOTAP\/DOPE based lipoplexes was respectively 2.5-and 1.4-fold higher through sputa that were liquefied by rhDNase (6 \u00b5g rhDNase\/ml) [49, 52] . Via MPT Dawson et al. showed that the average mobility of 200 nm polystyrene nanospheres was not altered in CF sputum that was liquefied by rhDNase (7 \u00b5g\/ml) [50] . However, rhDNase decreased the spreading of the diffusion coefficients of the nanoparticles [50] . Finally, the group of Shute et al. also found no effect of rhDNase on the transport of the same nanospheres through 'synthetic CF sputum', i.e. a mixture of DNA, mucin and actin [37] . However, in additional experiments they demonstrated that the lack of any effect of rhDNase on the transport of nanospheres was due to an inhibition of rhDNase by actin [37] . Indeed, the magnesium concentration in their 'synthetic sputum' (1.2 mM) was to low to keep actin fully polymerized [30] . Therefore, significant amounts of actin monomers, which strongly inhibit rhDNase [30] , are expected to present in their synthetic sputum. It has been proposed that gelsolin can also, besides depolymerizing actin, dissociate DNase-actin complexes [83] . However, the simultaneous addition of gelsolin and rhDNase did not restore the rhDNase activity nor increased the transport of nanospheres through 'synthetic sputum' [37] .\r\n N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and its derivatives lower the viscosity and elasticity of mucus by reducing the disulfide bonds between the subunits in mucins [13] . These mucin degrading agents can be administered orally or via inhalation. They are clinically used by e.g. asthma, COPD and CF patients to enhance the clearance of their respiratory secretions [84] . Interestingly, it has been reported that nacystelyn, a lysine salt of NAC, inhibits the maturation of dendritic cells and possess anti-inflammatory properties [85, 86] . These properties of nacystelyn may reduce the immune response against especially viral NANs. The effect of N-acetylcysteine based mucolytics on the efficacy of NANs or on the transport of nanospheres through mucus has been exclusive evaluate with normal respiratory mucus. This is probably due to the limited effects of these mucolytics agents on the viscosity and elasticity of CF sputum. Using the ex vivo sheep trachea model Ferrari et al. [67] demonstrated that the gene transfer of both ethyldimyristoylphosphatidyl choline\/cholesterol (EDMPC\/Chol) based lipoplexes and linear PEI based polyplexes was respectively~20 and~10-fold higher when the mucus covered epithelium was treated with nacystelyn or NAC before application of the NANs. Interestingly, intranasal administration of nacystelyn (150 \u00b5l; 100 mM) 30 min before intranasal application of the EDMPC\/Chol based lipoplexes resulted in a 100-fold increase in gene expression in the nasal turbinates of mice [67] . Strikingly, nasal delivery of nacystelyn together with the lipoplexes did not enhance and even slightly decreased the gene transfer efficiency of the lipoplexes [67] . Also Kushwah et al. found that intranasal administration of nacystelyn (50 \u00b5l, 100 mM) together with diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-dextran) coated adenoviruses did not enhance the gene transfer efficiency in the lungs of mice [81] . However, intranasal administration of nacystelyn 30 min before the application of the DEAEdextran coated adenoviruses significantly increased the distribution and the level of gene expression in the lungs of mice [81] . Therefore, the benefits of mucolytics on the gene transfer of NANs are probably compensated by an enhanced clearance of the NANs out the respiratory tract when NANs and mucolytic agents are administered together to the airways. Importantly, nacystelyn pretreatment did not enhance the gene transfer of uncoated adenoviruses in the lungs of mice [81] . This is in line with the observation that normal respiratory mucus did not represent a barrier to negatively charged adenoviral vectors in the ex vivo sheep trachea model of the group of Alton et al. [67] . Finally, nacystelyn did also not increase the transport of negatively charged polystyrene nanospheres (200 nm) through 'synthetic CF sputum' [37] .\r\n Magnetofection is a novel method to enhance the efficiency of NANs [87] . In this approach NANs are associated with magnetic particles and magnetic forces are used to pull the magnetic NANs towards the target cells and possibly also inside the target cells [87] . Magnetofection has been shown to increase transfection efficiency of NANs in cell cultures and in vivo [88] [89] [90] . Furthermore, Dames et al. demonstrated that aerosol droplets comprising superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs), so called nanomagnetosols, could be efficiently targeted to desired regions in the lungs of mice by application of external magnetic gradient fields during inhalation [91] . This is important progress towards deposition of higher dosages of NANs in the desired lung regions. We speculate that magnetic gradient fields may also pull magnetic NANs through the mucus or alveolar fluid barrier. Additionally, the usage of pulsed magnetic fields in addition to a target magnetic field [92] may further facilitate the uptake of magnetic NANs in respiratory cells. Addition of mucolytic agents to mucus mainly results in a reduction of the macroviscosity. However, as discussed earlier, the mobility of small nanospheres (\u2264200 nm) in CF sputum is determined by the microviscosity (i.e. the viscosity in the meshes of the network) and not by the macroviscosity [50] . Therefore, to enhance the mobility of these nanoparticles in CF sputum, mucolytic agents should specifically lower the microviscosity by degrading the polymers present in the meshes. The latter will reduce the viscous drag that the diffusing nanoparticles encounter, without releasing extra polymers from the three-dimensional network into the meshes. On the other hand larger nanoparticles are often 'caged' in the meshes or even cannot enter the meshes present in the mucus gel. For these larger (N200 nm) nanoparticles mucolytic agents should in the first place cut the filaments that build up the three-dimensional network. Therefore taking into account these considerations, we should give to NANs the capacity to specifically cleave these biopolymers that they encounter on their way through the mucus. This can be done by linking mucolytic enzymes to the surface of NANs and nanoparticles in general. Enzymes that can degrade mucin, DNA, actin, collagen or protein filaments are interesting candidates. Such functionalized NANs are expected to cut a way through the mucus. The observation that linkage of collagenase to nanoparticles enhanced their transport through the extracellular matrix proves that this idea may indeed work [93, 94] . Finally, we can also give extra speed to the NANs by attaching a 'motor' to their surface. This proposed strategy may sound quite futuristic. However, autonomous movement of nanosized objects has been obtained by putting chemical nanomotors to their surface [94, 95] .\r\n Low-frequency (20 to 100 kHz) ultrasound has been used to enhance the transport of drugs and drug carriers through the skin via a mechanism described as sonophoresis [96] . Sonophoresis is mainly caused by acoustic cavitation, i.e. the formation, oscillation and collapse of gaseous microbubbles in a fluid exposed to ultrasound waves [97] . These bubbles are spontaneously formed by ultrasound when dissolved air is present in the fluid. Cavitation can either be stable or inertial. Stable cavitation corresponds to the periodic growth\/ shrinking of microbubbles. Inertial cavitation is defined as the violent growth and collapse of microbubbles. Due to the collapse of these bubbles shock waves and microjets are generated [97] . These effects may increase the velocity of NANs and the mesh sizes in mucus. In a recent study we observed that the transport of polystyrene nanospheres (500 nm; negatively charged) through CF sputum was 10-fold higher in the presence of low-frequency ultrasound (Sanders et al., unpublished data) . In these experiments we used our vertical diffusion chamber setup (Fig. 3) [49] and exposed the CF sputum discontinuously (to prevent heating) to ultrasound. Taking into account that we used pulsed ultrasound the total exposure time to ultrasound was 2.3% of the duration of the transport experiment. Therefore, application of ultrasound for longer periods will probably cause more drastic increases. Although, these data are promising we want to remark that the application of ultrasound to the lungs is not simple. Indeed, ultrasound that enters the lungs from a source outside the body will be highly reflected by the air in the lungs. Therefore, to prevent this reflection of ultrasound by the air in the lungs one may also directly insert the ultrasound probe in the lungs, via a bronchoscope, as is done in bronchoscopic ultrasound examination of the tracheobronchial tree [98] . High-frequency ultrasound together with diagnostic microbubbles can increase the gene transfer efficacy of naked pDNA or NANs by temporarily perforating cell membranes [99] . Xenariou et al. recently found that an external high-frequency ultrasound source (1 MHz) combined with diagnostic microbubbles increased the gene transfer of naked pDNA in the lungs of mice [100] . These data may indicate that high-frequency ultrasound can reach the lung epithelial cells in mice. It is not know whether high-frequency ultrasound can also increase the transport of NANs through mucus.\r\n One of the most successful strategies to avoid interaction of NANs with components of biological fluids has been their modification with biocompatible hydrophilic but biologically inert polymers [58] . It is obvious that this concept may be applicable to pulmonary gene delivery, where reduction of interaction with mucus and alveolar fluid components is highly desirable. Shielding of NANs may not only be important to reduce interaction with mucus and alveolar fluid components but may also diminish clearance by alveolar macrophages which is considerably observed after aerosol delivery of non-shielded PEI polyplexes [101] . In this section we will first give an overview of the different strategies that can be used to avoid interaction of NANs with respiratory secretions. Subsequently we will discuss the behavior of shielded NANs in respiratory (CF) secretions. We will close this section with some critical remarks on PEGylation. Although the effect of mucolytic enzymes on the interaction of NANs with mucus components has not been studied in detail, one can expect that degraded mucus components will show less fatal interaction with NANs. Therefore, besides improving the mobility of NANs in (CF) mucus, mucolytic enzymes may also decrease the interactions of NANs with (CF) mucus components.\r\n Extracellular components most often interact with NANs via charge and hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, the aggregation and the interaction of NANs with extracellular components can be prevented by shielding the positive surface charges of NANs with neutral hydrophilic polymers (e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG)). NANs that bear such inert polymers at their surface can be obtained via two strategies. In the first strategy, which can only be used for non-viral NANs that are made via self-assembly, the cationic carrier is covalently coupled to the shielding polymer and subsequently mixed with the nucleic acids [102] . During the self-assembly the cationic carrier and the nucleic acids interact with each other and create a slightly hydrophobic core that is surrounded by a shield of hydrophilic polymers. This method has as disadvantage that the shielding polymers can, especially when high amounts of shielding polymer are used, hinder the self-assembling process between the cationic carrier and the nucleic acids. Therefore, post-shielding has been considered and involved the covalent attachment of the shielding polymer to pre-formed nonviral NANs [103, 104] . However, PEGylation also has back draws. Indeed, it is well known that PEG chains at the surface of NANs prevent endosomal escape, which has a negative effect on the biological efficiency of such shielded NANs. Therefore, different groups are currently making NANs that lose their PEG-chains at the cell surface or in acidifying endosomes [105] .\r\n Finally, the surface of charged NANs can also be modified by absorption of opposite charged polymers. For example, Cheung et al. [106] coated cationic non-viral NANs with poly(propylacrylic acid) (PPAA), an anionic polymer that can disrupt endosomal membranes, while Finsinger et al. [107] coated the cationic surface of NANs by using a PEG that was linked to negatively charged peptides. A drawback of this strategy is, however, that the stability of the ionic coating in blood or mucus is questionable and has not yet been demonstrated. This post-shielding strategy has also been applied to prevent recognition of viral NANs by the immune system and to enable retargeting of these viral NANs to a desired tissue [108, 109] .\r\n Lipoplexes based on the GL67 (genzyme lipid 67) lipid are one of the most successful NANs for gene delivery to the lungs [110] . In their optimized formulation these lipoplexes contain PEGylated lipids. Sanders et al. has comprehensively demonstrated the benefits of the presence of these PEG-lipids in these lipoplexes [111] . In contrast to the cationic DOTAP\/DOPE lipoplexes, exposure of these PEGylated GL67\/DOPE lipoplexes to CF mucus compounds (linear DNA, albumin, phospholipids and mucin), at concentrations expected to occur in vivo, did not affect their gene transfection activity [111] . Additionally, these PEG chains prevented that these GL67\/DOPE lipoplexes became aggregated by the CF mucus compounds. Similar observations were made for PEG copolymer-protected PEI polyplexes which adsorbed only low amounts of serum-derived proteins and were virtually inert against mucin binding from BALF [112] . However, copolymer protection resulted in a strong decrease of transfection efficiency in the mouse lungs, which could be partially restored by coupling of transferrin as a targeting ligand [112] . An increase of the colloidal stability in the presence of BALF has also been observed for PEGylated and TAT peptide-modified PEI polyplexes [113] . Another approach which has been successfully performed to achieve high transfection efficiency of PEI polyplexes in the presence of CF sputum sol phase makes use of polyplex pre-incubation with serum albumin [114] . Although the underlying mechanism has not been entirely elucidated up till now, pre-incubation of PEI polyplexes with human serum albumin resulted in up to 80-fold higher transfection rates in the presence of CF sputum than without human serum albumin [114] . The authors speculate that the albumin-coated PEI polyplexes may have been targeted to albumin receptors which are expressed on the apical surface. In context with this observation coupling of targeting ligands to the NANs may represent a suitable approach to augment their transfection efficiency. An increase in gene transfer efficiency has been obtained in lung epithelial cells with various targeting ligands, like SP-B [115] , UTP [116] , mannuronic acid [117] , and lactoferrin [118] . Coupling of targeting ligands to NANs may be of particular interest to increase their internalization kinetics by the targeted lung cells in terms of the fast clearance kinetics by the alveolar macrophages. Indeed, one has to consider that one microliter (1 mm 3 ) of BALF contains roughly 19.000 alveolar macrophages [44] .\r\n In summary, these results allow us to conclude that shielding of NANs by e.g. polyethylene glycol favors their physicochemical stability and their gene transfer capacity in the presence of respiratory (CF) secretions.\r\n The presence of e.g. PEG polymers on the surface of NANs prevents aggregation by avoiding that NANs can come in close proximity to each other during collision. However, the surface of NANs is often not completely covered with the shielding polymer. Therefore, between the shielding polymers gaps may be present that allow small charged molecules to reach the surface of the NANs. Indeed, we have for example observed that albumin (at concentrations found in blood) is able to penetrate between the PEG of siRNA-liposome complexes containing 5 mol% PEG-lipids and to cause the release of all the siRNAs [119] . Similarly, high amounts of albumin could release one third of the pDNA from PEGylated GL67\/DOPE lipoplexes [111] . This indicates that albumin is on one hand small enough to penetrate between the PEG chains, and on the other hand large enough to allow a 'thermodynamical' competition with pDNA for binding to the cationic lipids. The anionic phospholipids present in lung surfactant were also able to dissociate these PEGylated GL67\/DOPE lipoplexes [111] . However, the dissociation was very limited and only occurred when the lipoplexes were incubated with extreme high concentrations of lung surfactant. This indicates that the 'thermodynamic power' of these negatively charged phospholipids to push off the much larger pDNA molecules from the cationic liposomes is low. To prevent that small molecules, like albumin, can penetrate between the PEG-chains of PEGylated NANs one can either increase the degree of shielding or the chain length of the polymers. However, one should realize that for example long PEG chains (~N 10 kDa) may entangle in the biopolymer network of biogels [51] . Therefore, particles containing such long PEG chains may become immobilized in mucus.\r\n During the design of new NANs for respiratory gene therapy one should take into account that respiratory secretions are present above the target cells. In this review we demonstrated that the size and the surface properties of especially non-viral NANs determine their behavior in respiratory secretions. A first key message is that the cationic surface of (non-viral) NANs should be shielded by neutral and hydrophilic polymers to prevent that these NANs stick to the threedimensional polymer network in respiratory mucus and\/or become covered or dissociated by macromolecules that are not embedded in the mucus network. Additionally, NANs with a too hydrophobic surface are also expected to stick to the mucus network. Does the size of NANs matter? Two independent reports clearly found that smaller nanoparticles are less retarded by CF sputum [49, 50] . Based on these reports we can conclude that NANs should be 100 nm or smaller to allow free passive through the mesh network in CF sputum. However, one should realize that this size is not necessarily the optimal size for free diffusion of NANs in normal respiratory mucus or other type of mucus. Indeed, it has been recently demonstrated that large (surface shielded) polystyrene nanospheres move faster through cervical mucus than their smaller (also surface shielded) counterparts [51] . It is important to realize that the thickness of the mucus layer is also an important barrier. Indeed, only a small fraction of nanoparticles can cross a 150 \u00b5m thick mucus blanket within 150 min, i.e. the estimated renewal time of respiratory mucus. Therefore, to drastically enhance the number of NANs that can reach the cells beneath the mucus layer one should give 'motility' to the NANs. Possible approaches are for example the attachment of nanomotors to the NANs or the use of ultrasound or magnetic forces.\r\n Besides optimizing the design of the NANs one can also try to reduce the barrier properties of respiratory secretions. All the data in the literature consistently confirm that treatment of the respiratory tract with mucolytic agents like NAC or rhDNase (at least 30 min) before the administration of NANs significantly favor respiratory gene transfer [67, 81] . Via this pre-treatment with mucolytics a significant amount of the mucus is probably removed.","sha":"967a036d4cfc426eaed8930f27810d48de812932","publish_time":"2009-02-27","authors":"Sanders, Niek; Rudolph, Carsten; Braeckmans, Kevin; De Smedt, Stefaan C.; Demeester, Joseph","journal":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","doi":"10.1016\/j.addr.2008.09.011","Title":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","H index":278.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Respiratory gene therapy is considered for the treatment of a variety of lung diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF), asthma, emphysema, lung cancer, \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin deficiency and surfactant protein-B (SP-B) deficiency [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Recently, the delivery of siRNA containing nanoparticles to the lungs has also gained much attention for the treatment of lung infections caused by e.g. SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) or (avian) influenza viruses [8] . Nevertheless, systemic administration is still the best delivery route if the NANs need to transfect the endothelial cells of capillaries that supply blood to e.g. lung tumors. Respiratory stem cells are interesting targets for genetic diseases like CF [10] . The latter has been covered by some recent reviews [1, 3, 4] . This part will be followed with an overview and discussion of the scientific papers that deal with the behavior of NANs in the different extracellular secretions present in the respiratory tract. Most of the efforts in respiratory gene therapy have focused on CF gene therapy. The air we daily inhale contains besides gas also dust, toxic substances and pathogens. Inhaled materials are captured in this blanket of mucus and are together with the mucus continuously transported by the cilia to the esophagus. Indeed, in lung diseases characterized by very tenacious mucus the mucociliary clearance is impaired and elimination of mucus occurs via coughing [14, 15] . The thickness of the mucus layer depends on the location in the airways and the presence of a pathologic condition. The subunits, which have a length of about 500 nm, consist of a highly glycosylated protein backbone with non-glycosylated ends [24] . The molecular weight of mucins varies from 2 to 16 MDa. Mucins are negatively charged due to the presence of N-acetylneuramic acids (also called sialic acids) and sulphated monosaccharides in the sugars chains [23, 24] . It is important to realize that each epithelial layer secretes its own characteristic mucins. Additionally, it has been found that the glycosylation pattern of these respiratory mucins is altered in CF patients [26] . The concentration of the different constituents and the physical properties of normal respiratory mucus have not been studied in detail as it is very difficult to collect normal lung mucus. Schematic representation of human respiratory mucins and their carbohydrate side chains. Mucins consist out of up to 5 subunits attached to each other by disulfide bonds. The depicted carbohydrate chain is only illustrative. Ala, Gly, Pro, Thr, Ga, GaN, Gn, and NA correspond respectively to alanine, glycine, proline, threonine, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylneuraminic acid (adapted from Ref. [ Nevertheless, in non-pathological mucus the mucin concentration is about 20 g\/l [27, 28] . However, higher mucin concentrations (up to 47 g\/l) were found in CF patients that produce very tenacious sputum [31] . DNA and actin have like mucins a high molecular weight and can cross-link and thereby form a DNA or actin gel (Figs. These properties of DNA and actin drastically increase the viscoelasticity of CF mucus. The detailed composition of the pulmonary surfactant was characterized from biochemical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and is composed of lipids (90%) and proteins (10%) [39] . About 80% of the lipids are phophatidylcholins (PC). These proteins originate either from plasma or are expressed from the lung tissue. The viscoelasticity was determined by a rotation rheometer (AR 1000, TA-Instruments) using a cone-plate geometry. BALF also protects the alveoli against pathogens. These fatal interactions will be discussed in Section 4. The latter can lead to aggregation of the NANs which will further impede their capacity to move through the meshes of the biopolymer network in mucus. Additionally, even when no aggregation occurs, it has been reported that the binding of extracellular compounds to the surface of NANs may drastically decrease their gene transfer capacity [46] . The respiratory cilia transport mucus at a rate of 3.6 mm\/min [47] . Information on the mobility of NANs in respiratory mucus is very scarce. However, polystyrene nanoparticles have been used in several papers to gain insights into the mobility of nanosized drug carriers in respiratory mucus. The findings of these three groups are reviewed in this section. In these experiments we sandwiched a 220 \u00b5m thick layer of CF sputum between the donor and acceptor side of vertical diffusion chambers ( Fig. Snapwells containing a polycarbonate membrane (pore size 3 \u00b5m) were modified by gluing a 220 \u00b5m thick ring on their borders. These data also indicate that for small particles (~120 nm) the low transport through the CF sputum is primarily due to the distance (i.e. the thickness of the sputum layer) the particles have to travel. For larger particles (~270 nm) the low transport through CF sputum is due to both the latter phenomenon as well as steric obstruction of the particles by the biopolymer network in CF sputum. The mean mesh sizes (\u00b1standard deviation) determined by AFM in 3 CF sputa were 300 \u00b1 106 nm, 578 \u00b1 191 nm and 711 \u00b1 328 nm [37] . Although, these mesh sizes are larger than the ones derived from the electron microscopy pictures of CF sputum, they are still not large enough to allow completely unhindered passage of 560 nm nanospheres. Of course the latter only holds true if the nanospheres are small enough to enter the meshes in the sputa. Therefore, the microviscosity in low viscoelastic sputa is probably higher than the microviscosity in high viscoelastic sputa. Based on this hypothesis degradation of the biopolymer network in CF sputum by mucolytic drugs may not be the most ideal strategy to enhance transport of nanoparticles through mucus. From the perspective of a diffusion particle these two effects are counteracting. In a MPT experiment a high-speed film is recorded of particles. By determining the position of the particles in all frames of the MPT film, trajectories can be calculated for each individual particle as shown in A (colored lines). and the corresponding quantitative parameters (diffusion coefficient, velocity). For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) agents on the transport of nanoparticles and on the gene transfer capacity of NANs are discussed in more detail in Section 5.1.1. The group of Justin Hanes used multiple particle tracking (MPT), also sometimes indicated as single particles tracking (SPT), to gain more insights into the diffusion characteristics of individual nanospheres in CF sputum [50, 54] . This MSD can be related to the diffusion coefficient through different models, depending on the type of motion. The average diffusion coefficient of the 100, 200 and 500 nm nanospheres in CF sputum as measured with MPT was 300-fold, 500-fold and 2400-fold lower than in buffer. CF sputum caused a much lower retardation of nanospheres [49] . Such a fast-moving fraction was not observed with the 500 nm nanospheres [50] . In their experiments they mixed the nanospheres with CF sputum. After 1 h they measured the amount of nanospheres in the lower compartment. Consequently, one can expect that viral NANs based on these viruses will bind via charge interactions to negatively charged components present in mucus. Due to the lack of other reports on this topic we will in this section mainly focus on our data. We examined the influence of individual CF sputum components and diluted CF sputum on the physicochemical stability and gene transfection activity of cationic DOTAP\/DOPE lipoplexes [31] . It is known that the network structure in CF sputum cannot be simulated by simply mixing of CF sputum constituents. The efficiency of both NANs was significantly decreased by CF sputum. Interestingly, these experiments demonstrated that normal respiratory mucus did not represent a barrier to adenovirus and sendai mediated gene transfer, while the gene transfer of both lipoplexes and polyplexes was~30-fold lower in the presence of normal respiratory mucus (Figs. This is not surprising as adenoviruses are causing the common cold. Hydrophobic interactions play a role in the formation of a mucin gel [68] . Therefore, it is possible that viruses like adenoviruses have hydrophobic moieties on their surface that can disrupt the hydrophobic cross links between mucins. Therefore, it has been suggested that this inhibitory effect is compensated by other constituents of naturally derived surfactant, presumably the surfactant proteins, although this requires further detailed investigation [73] . BALF proteins were absorbed more intensively to lipoplexes than to polyplexes [76] . Interestingly transfection inhibition was stronger for polyplexes than for lipoplexes, although the latter were more prone to adsorption of BALF components [76] . Increasing the mobility of NANs in respiratory mucus\r\n To facilitate their mobility in protective mucus layers certain bacteria, fungi and viruses secrete enzymes that hydrolyze mucins [78] [79] [80] . Therefore, many research groups evaluated the effect of different mucolytic agents, which either degrade actin, DNA or mucin, on the mobility of NANs and nanospheres in (CF) mucus [37, 49, 50, 67, 81] . However, as discussed above mucolytic agents that degraded the biopolymers that build up the three-dimensional polymer network in CF sputum will not only increase the mesh size, but also the viscous drag in the meshes between the cross-linked biopolymers. However, this does not exclude that mucolytics have a positive effect on the transport of NANs or nanospheres through normal respiratory mucus, which has other biophysical properties than CF sputum. RhDNase is administered to CF patients via inhalation. However, the simultaneous addition of gelsolin and rhDNase did not restore the rhDNase activity nor increased the transport of nanospheres through 'synthetic sputum' [37] . These mucin degrading agents can be administered orally or via inhalation. However, intranasal administration of nacystelyn 30 min before the application of the DEAEdextran coated adenoviruses significantly increased the distribution and the level of gene expression in the lungs of mice [81] . This is in line with the observation that normal respiratory mucus did not represent a barrier to negatively charged adenoviral vectors in the ex vivo sheep trachea model of the group of Alton et al. [ Addition of mucolytic agents to mucus mainly results in a reduction of the macroviscosity. This can be done by linking mucolytic enzymes to the surface of NANs and nanoparticles in general. Finally, we can also give extra speed to the NANs by attaching a 'motor' to their surface. This proposed strategy may sound quite futuristic. Sonophoresis is mainly caused by acoustic cavitation, i.e. the formation, oscillation and collapse of gaseous microbubbles in a fluid exposed to ultrasound waves [97] . Cavitation can either be stable or inertial. Stable cavitation corresponds to the periodic growth\/ shrinking of microbubbles. These effects may increase the velocity of NANs and the mesh sizes in mucus. In these experiments we used our vertical diffusion chamber setup (Fig. 3) [49] and exposed the CF sputum discontinuously (to prevent heating) to ultrasound. Therefore, application of ultrasound for longer periods will probably cause more drastic increases. In this section we will first give an overview of the different strategies that can be used to avoid interaction of NANs with respiratory secretions. Therefore, besides improving the mobility of NANs in (CF) mucus, mucolytic enzymes may also decrease the interactions of NANs with (CF) mucus components. Extracellular components most often interact with NANs via charge and hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, the aggregation and the interaction of NANs with extracellular components can be prevented by shielding the positive surface charges of NANs with neutral hydrophilic polymers (e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG)). This post-shielding strategy has also been applied to prevent recognition of viral NANs by the immune system and to enable retargeting of these viral NANs to a desired tissue [108, 109] . In their optimized formulation these lipoplexes contain PEGylated lipids. Although the underlying mechanism has not been entirely elucidated up till now, pre-incubation of PEI polyplexes with human serum albumin resulted in up to 80-fold higher transfection rates in the presence of CF sputum than without human serum albumin [114] . This indicates that albumin is on one hand small enough to penetrate between the PEG chains, and on the other hand large enough to allow a 'thermodynamical' competition with pDNA for binding to the cationic lipids. The anionic phospholipids present in lung surfactant were also able to dissociate these PEGylated GL67\/DOPE lipoplexes [111] . During the design of new NANs for respiratory gene therapy one should take into account that respiratory secretions are present above the target cells. A first key message is that the cationic surface of (non-viral) NANs should be shielded by neutral and hydrophilic polymers to prevent that these NANs stick to the threedimensional polymer network in respiratory mucus and\/or become covered or dissociated by macromolecules that are not embedded in the mucus network. Possible approaches are for example the attachment of nanomotors to the NANs or the use of ultrasound or magnetic forces."},{"Unnamed: 0":18,"Unnamed: 0.1":18,"doc_id":"bf1ef8990f25eb86c24864f13004da9415d02d70","title":"Nanotechnology and pulmonary delivery to overcome resistance in infectious diseases \u2606","abstract":"Used since ancient times especially for the local treatment of pulmonary diseases, lungs and airways are a versatile target route for the administration of both local and systemic drugs. Despite the existence of different platforms and devices for the pulmonary administration of drugs, only a few formulations are marketed, partly due to physiological and technological limitations. Respiratory infections represent a significant burden to health systems worldwide mainly due to intrahospital infections that more easily affect immune-compromised patients. Moreover, tuberculosis (TB) is an endemic infectious disease in many developing nations and it has resurged in the developed world associated with the human immunodeficiency virus\/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV\/AIDS) epidemic. Currently, medicine faces the specter of antibiotic resistance. Besides the development of new anti-infectious drugs, the development of innovative and more efficient delivery systems for drugs that went off patent appears as a promising strategy pursued by the pharmaceutical industry to improve the therapeutic outcomes and to prolong the utilities of their intellectual property portfolio. In this context, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems (nano-DDS) emerged as a promising approach to circumvent the limitations of conventional formulations and to treat drug resistance, opening the hypothesis for new developments in this area.","text_body":"Macrophage \r\n Inhalation of compounds as a means to treat diseases is used since ancient times. The oldest reports came from China and India around 2000 BC and are related to the inhalation of smoke from burned herbal preparations based on Ephedra sinica or Daturastramonium to treat asthma, respectively [1, 2] . Pedanus Discorides the Greek physician, surgeon, pharmacologist, botanist and author of De Materia Medica (considered the first pharmacopeia) as well as Aelius Galenus (129-199\/217 AD) prescribed inhaled sulfur vapors to their patients [3] . Although the word \"inhaler\" was used for the first time by the English physician John Mudge in 1778 to describe his invention, the first therapeutic inhalation device is attributed to Hippocrates (460-377 BC) [1, 2] . Through the years, many compounds and mixtures were proposed and used to treat different diseases using various methods for inhalation. From ceramic inhalers, to combustible powders, burning papers and liquid atomizers. Very curious and popular ways to inhale compounds in the 19th and 20th centuries were the asthma cigarettes which were withdrawn from the market in 1992 [1, 3] . The inhalation of vapor from solutions of picric acid, tar, iodine or sulfuric acid was very popular in the 20th century to treat TB and other infections, especially in spas [3] . The first mentions regarding inhalation of antibiotics such as penicillin by nebulization to treat pulmonary infections were published in the 1940s [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Nowadays, inhaled drugs are preferentially administered via dry powder inhalers (DPI) and pressurized metereddose inhalers (pMDI), being also used as nebulizers in hospitals.\r\n Despite inhalation being started as a route to treat diseases constrained to the respiratory tract, with scientific and technological advances, a change in paradigm took place and over the years, inhalation has been clinically evaluated and used to treat both local and systemic diseases [8] such as asthma [9] , TB [10] and other bacterial infections [11] , influenza virus infection [12] , fungal infections [13] , cystic fibrosis [14] , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [15] , diabetes [16] or cancer [17, 18] . Moreover, inhalation has been also tested as a non-invasive vaccination platform [19, 20] .\r\n Driven by the progress in the nanomedicine field, many researchers developed innovative formulations with improved biopharmaceutical features [21, 22] , allowing the pulmonary administration of many drugs that otherwise could not be administered by inhalation. Such formulations represented promising, although preliminary, alternatives to conventional inhaled formulations [23, 24] . In this context, a new door has been opened in the field of inhalation therapy and new advances could be expected in the near future.\r\n This work reviews the state-of-on overcoming drug resistance.\r\n Lungs and airways are a site for gas exchange and contact with the exterior, being exposed to organic, inorganic and biological components that can cause disease. There are a variety of bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections that affect the lungs and can progress toward systemic infection, including pneumonia, TB, influenza, aspergillosis, among others. Infections of the lower respiratory tract are among the top three major causes of morbidity worldwide and first in lowincome countries, being responsible for approximately 3.5 million deaths annually [25] .\r\n Pneumonia is a common infectious pulmonary disease that has many etiological agents, including bacteria, viruses and fungi such as Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumonia, Moraxella catarrhalis, human respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila or Pneumocystis jiroveci. It is the leading cause of death in children worldwide killing annually around 1.8 million children under the age of five years [26, 27] . Nosocomial pneumonia, especially in ventilated patients, is unfortunately frequent and represents more than 50% of antibiotic prescriptions in intensive care units [28] . Also, the development of resistant strains in hospitals is causing a great deal of concern among health professionals. The therapy is chosen according to the etiological agent and the severity of the disease, the reason why it is imperative to identify the etiological agent and its sensitiveness to the available therapeutic portfolio in order to treat the patient in a rational way and to prevent the development of resistant strains.\r\n TB is an infectious disease caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis that primarily but not exclusively affects the lungs. It is the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide being declared a global public health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993, a distinction never granted to any other disease. In 2011, there were around 8.7 million incident cases of TB, 1 million deaths among HIV-negative people and an additional 0.43 million deaths from HIV-associated TB [29] . The current therapy includes long-term multiple dose oral administration of various drugs, which sometimes leads to low patient compliance and therefore to the development of multidrug-resistant strains referred to as multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). The first-line drugs used in the treatment of standard TB are rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin [30, 31] . At the moment new drugs are in clinical trials [32] constituting a hope for the treatment of resistant forms of the disease. In addition to the development of resistance, the difficulty to treat TB stems from the fact that when administered systemically many anti-TB drugs fail to reach the lungs or penetrate into the alveolar macrophages, the reservoir of M. tuberculosis [31, 33] . M. tuberculosis persists in macrophages within a granuloma formed in the lungs of the infected hosts. Thus, traditional drug chemotherapy has serious limitations particularly the drug internalization and cytosolic availability on the infected phagocytic cells [34] . This phenomenon has driven many researchers to develop drug delivery systems (DDS) that improve the treatment of such burden.\r\n Another important question is related to the incidence of pulmonary fungal infections that has increased in the last decades partially due to the growing number of immune-compromised patients related to HIV, cancer, hematologic disorders, and organ transplantations [35] . There are a variety of fungal infections such as histoplasmosis (Histoplasma capsulatum), sporotrichosis (Sporothrix schenkii), blastomycosis (Blastomyces dermatitidis), coccidioidomycosis (Coccidioides spp.), paracoccidioidomycosis (Paracoccidioides brasiliensis) cryptococcosis (Cryptococcus spp.), aspergillosis (Aspergillus spp.), candidiasis (Candida spp.), pneumonia (Candida spp. and Pneumocystis spp.) or Trichosporon spp. infection that can cause pulmonary injury with different severities [35] . Actually, there are a variety of anti-fungal drugs available in the market generally administered orally or intravenously. They include amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmB), itraconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin [35] . Among the anti-fungal drugs used to treat fungal infections, AmB is considered the gold standard therapy and it is the most commonly used therapy to treat life-threatening cases. The nephro-and cardiotoxicity of AmB is the major clinical drawback, which could lead to treatment discontinuation [36] . At the moment the marketed formulations of AmB usually used in clinical practice (e.g. AmBisome\u00ae (Gilead Sciences), Fungizone\u00ae (Bristol-Myers Squibb) or Abelcet\u00ae (Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)) are lipid-based DDS that present lower toxicity, while resulting in higher drug therapeutic index. AmB is extensively formulated in various nano-DDS being a proof-of-concept of the usefulness of nanomedicine in the delivery of anti-fungal drugs [37] [38] [39] .\r\n Regarding viral infections, another devastating problem, several viruses are responsible for acute respiratory infections namely the influenza virus, coxsackie virus, echovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, corona virus, and most recently human metapneumovirus, torque tenovirus, human bocavirus, polyomaviruses, avian influenza virus H5N1, and polyomavirus [40] [41] [42] . Nevertheless, the influenza virus is the main cause of viral airway infections worldwide related to severe annual epidemics, while the respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus are the most important causes of viral infection of the lower respiratory tract in children. Vaccination is the primary means of preventing and controlling viral infections, especially annual outbreaks of influenza. At the moment, few drugs are available to treat pulmonary viral infections like amantadine (Symmetrel\u00ae, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), rimantadine (Flumadine\u00ae, Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae, Hoffmann-La Roche) usually used in young, elderly, and other groups of patients with other serious medical conditions. Currently these drugs are administered by the oral route. Only recently, zanamivir formulated in a DPI (Relenza\u00ae, GlaxoSmithKline) was approved for the treatment of influenza by the pulmonary route. Unfortunately, there is yet no specific treatment or a vaccine available for the viruses identified recently.\r\n Since the 1940s antimicrobial agents have reduced the illnesses and deaths associated with infections, the discovery of penicillin being one of the greatest advances in health in the 20th century. However, through the years the accumulated overuse and misuse of anti-infectious drugs have led to the development of resistant strains. Microorganisms developed, by genetic mutations or acquisition of resistance genes, defense mechanisms that make them more dangerous and difficult to treat such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or vancomycinresistant Enterococcus, resulting in prolonged illness and greater risk of death [43, 44] . In addition, intracellular infections are difficult to eradicate due to low availability and activity of anti-infectious drugs inside cells. In order to treat patients with resistant strains, high doses of drugs are used that present adverse effects to healthy tissues and organs.\r\n Despite the advances seen in the development of new antibiotics, drug resistance remains a huge public health problem. According to the World Health Organization around 440,000 new cases of MDR-TB emerge annually, causing at least 150,000 deaths worldwide [43] . Some cases of drug resistance have also been reported to HIV and influenza [44] . Nowadays, the main research focus on infectious diseases falls on the development of strategies to improve the therapeutic index of the available drugs, with nanotechnology in the forefront of the research [45] .\r\n The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a drug are highly dependent on its physical and chemical features and it is influenced by the type of formulation used to deliver it. By scaling down the size of compounds, nano-DDS can modulate and improve the performance of many drugs to an extent not achievable by conventional formulations. For example, nano-DDS can be capitalized to encapsulate drugs and thereby (i) increase their solubility, (ii) protect them from degradation, (iii) enhance their epithelial absorption and increase their blood circulation time, (iv) target the drugs to specific cells\/tissues\/organs, releasing them in a controlled manner as a response to a specific stimulus, and (v) enhance their uptake by cells [22, 23, 46] . In addition, combined nano-DDS can simultaneously detect and treat a disease by encompassing both imaging and therapeutic compounds, an emerging field known as theranostics [47] . In the near future, nanomedicine could play a key role to achieve the highly desired personalized medicine.\r\n Over the last decades, the usefulness of the design and development of nano-DDS to overcome a variety of biopharmaceutical drawbacks in the diagnosis, prevention, immunization and treatment of disease has been intensively explored by a large number of research groups worldwide, leading to a great number of scientific articles published in international journals. Moreover, it has generated a profuse intellectual property platform. However, and despite the fact that nanomedicine began as a discipline almost half a century ago, only a few nano-DDS have found their way to the market [48] . This phenomenon could be explained by the lack of financial profitability, consumer distrust and the lack of confidence due to poor information\/education, ineffective regulation of new and generic products, and weak patent protection [49] . At the moment, regulatory agencies are in process of developing specific guidelines and regulations regarding nanotechnologybased products in order to develop new tools, standards, and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of such products [50, 51] . Nonetheless, the relatively few marketed nano-DDS have been successful in their respective therapeutic areas. According to BCC Research, the global nanomedicine market has been growing steadily, reaching a value of $72.8 billion in 2011, with anticancer agents as the market leader and it is expected to increase at an annual growth rate of 12.5% until 2016 reaching $130.9 billion [52] .\r\n In this context, many research groups have consolidated the concept of pulmonary delivery of drugs using nano-DDS. Preliminary results are promising and it is expected that the clinical relevance of such products could be proven in clinical trials [18, 23, 53] . The therapeutic efficiency of anti-infectious drugs can be improved by enhancing their solubility, pulmonary accumulation and further intracellular delivery thus increasing the local concentration of drugs, reducing the dose and frequency of administration and minimizing at the same time the drugs' systemic side effects [33, 54] . Consequently, patient compliance is augmented avoiding the development of multidrug-resistant strains. Still, several issues such as large scale production, batch-to-batch reproducibility, variable lung deposition pattern, or cost-effectiveness balance of the treatment need to be addressed and optimized in order to ensure the bench-to-bedside translation of inhalatory nano-DDS.\r\n As stated above, inhalation serves as a platform for the delivery of drugs aimed to display both local and systemic activity. The same anatomical and physiological characteristics that can make airways susceptible to infection by external pathogens can be exploited for drug delivery. The respiratory system provides a non-invasive route of delivery with a large surface area, a thin epithelial barrier, extensive blood supply and blood flow, and lower enzymatic activity compared to other organs in the body (e.g., liver and gastrointestinal tract). Also, first-pass metabolism is avoided by pulmonary administration, which is especially useful for drugs that suffer high hepatic metabolism [53, 55] . After inhalation, particles will be transported with the inhaled air through the respiratory tract until they will be deposited or exhaled. Among the features that influence the behavior of inhaled particles in the airways, the mean aerodynamic diameter (Eq. (1)) plays an important role as it governs the particle deposition pattern.\r\n Where deq is the diameter of an equivalent volume sphere of unit density, \u03c1p and \u03c1o are particle and unit densities and X is the dynamic shape factor.\r\n It is commonly accepted that the optimal mean aerodynamic diameter range for particle deposition in the lower airways is 1-3 \u03bcm. Particles larger than 5 \u03bcm undergo deposition in the oropharynx and they are consequently swallowed, while particles smaller than 1 \u03bcm are likely exhaled [55, 56] . However, studies in the area of environmental toxicology showed that nanoparticles with sizes ranging between 1 and 100 nm could also randomly deposit to a great extent in the lower airways ( Fig. 1 ) [57] . The mechanisms involved in particle deposition also depend on the anatomy of the airway region and they include inertial impaction, sedimentation and diffusion (Fig. 2) [58, 59] .\r\n Besides drugs, pharmaceutical excipients constitute an integral part of pharmaceutical formulations. They provide physical, chemical or microbiological stability, bulk properties that improve handling and metering, while controlling the mechanical and pharmaceutical properties of formulations such as release and permeation [56, 60] . At the moment, only a small number of excipients are authorized for pulmonary delivery, but a variety of new excipients is under evaluation. Since lungs have limited buffer capacity, only compounds that are biocompatible or endogenous to the lung and that are easily metabolized or cleared can be used in inhaled formulations [60] . Since formulations for nebulization are liquid solutions or suspensions, the common excipients used are salts (e.g., NaCl) to adjust the osmolarity (300 mosmol\/L), HCl, NaOH, phosphates to adjust the pH to neutrality, and surfactants such as polysorbates, sorbitan monostearate, oleic acid and soy lecithin to facilitate the formation of liquid droplets. Ethanol can be used as co-solvent and permeation enhancer only in small concentration due to its irritation potential. Preservatives, antioxidants or chelating agents such as parabens and benzalkonium chloride, ascorbic acid, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) can also be used to enhance stability [56] . The excipients used in pMDI are similar to those found in preparations for nebulization except for the gas propellants. The most widely excipient used as propellant in pMDI is hydrofluoroalkane, a non-toxic, non-flammable, and chemically stable gas without carcinogenic or mutagenic effects. Due to the absence of ozone-depleting properties, hydrofluoroalkane has been replacing chlorofluorocarbon-based propellants [61] . DPI were developed as a response to the limitations regarding stability and environmental aspects of pMDI and nebulizers [60] . Being solid dispersions of drugs blended with a coarse carrier particle, the efficacy of a DPI depends on powder technology and particle engineering. In DPI, the coarse carrier particle is the major component of the formulation (N95%, w\/w). It provides bulk properties and reduces the cohesion forces between drug particles, facilitating the aerosol dispersion and defining deposition pattern [62] . Lactose is the main excipient used as coarse and larger carrier particles and, to a lower extent, as cryoprotectant when particles are prepared using lyophilization. A variety of inhalation grade lactoses with a narrow particle size distribution like Lactohale 100\u00ae, Inhalac 230\u00ae or Respitose ML001\u00ae are commercially available. Other sugars such as glucose, trehalose and mannitol are also used as cryoprotectants and coarse carriers [56] . Magnesium stearate is approved for inhalation to protect the drug from moisture and to reduce cohesion and adhesion between particles [63] . Regarding inhaled nano-DDS, most of the components are generally not approved for inhalation. In this case, new excipients proposed for inhalatory formulations need to pass through the entire process of safety evaluation, including complete in vitro toxicological evaluation and in vivo assessment of non-clinical and clinical safety prior to licensing. Unfortunately, there is a lack of specific regulatory guidance regarding the toxicological assessment of excipients for inhalation [64] [65] [66] . Excipients generally recognized as safe (GRAS) or those approved for other routes of administration need a more limited number of experiments for safety evaluation, their acceptance by regulatory agencies being usually easier. This is the case of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a lipid surfactant and one of the constituents of lung surfactant that is commonly used in the production of liposomes. Studies show that PC-based liposomes do not affect or slightly decrease the viability of human A549 alveolar cells after 24 h of exposure. The effects on cell viability are dependent on the PC derivate and the concentration used [67] . Other compounds used in the development of nano-DDS such as dextran, alginate, carrageenan or gelatin also possess GRAS status. It should be mentioned that that regulations apply not only to the material itself but also to its source. Thus, chitosan obtained from Aspergillus niger is in the process to obtain GRAS status. Chitosan does not present significant toxicity to pulmonary tissue and cells after inhalation [68, 69] . In fact, some studies showed some protective effect against oxidative stress [68] . Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) is another biodegradable polymer extensively used in the production of nano-DDS. The cytotoxicity of PLGA nanoparticles with different coatings and surface charges was assessed. Results showed that the cytotoxicity to human bronchial Calu-3 cells was very limited, with the absence of inflammatory response [70] . Cyclodextrins (CDs) have been tested as complexing agents and excipients of inhalatory formulations. Various approved formulations containing CDs such as Voltaren\u00ae (Novartis), Clorocil\u00ae (Laborat\u00f3rio Edol), Brexin\u00ae (Chiesi Farmaceutici) or Vfend\u00ae (Pfizer), are used daily in the clinical practice for administration routes other than inhalation [71] .\r\n Recently, carrier-free formulations that presented good aerosolization properties and deposition patterns have been developed and proposed as promising inhalatory formulations [72, 73] . This \"carrierless\" strategy avoided the need for long and expensive safety studies, facilitating the authorization by regulatory agencies. At the moment, there are commercially available carrier-free DPI composed by agglomerates of pure terbutalin and budesonide particles, namely Bricanyl Turbohaler\u00ae (AstraZeneca) and Pulmicort Turbohaler\u00ae (AstraZeneca), respectively.\r\n Apart from the characteristics of particles and formulations, inhalatory administration demands an inhaler device that produces an appropriate aerosol. There are numerous devices available with distinct properties and specifications that are more appropriate than others for each type of formulation (Fig. 3) . Since the device greatly influences the particle aerosolization and deposition pattern, the choice of the appropriate device for a specific formulation is one of the most timeconsuming and challenging stages of the development phase and it is imperative to ensure the drug efficacy [62, 74] . For example, Alexander et al. tested the aerosolization efficacy of Ambisome\u00ae (Gilead Sciences) using different nebulizers and they found differences among all of them [75] . The inhaler device needs to be accurate, small, easy to handle, discreet, and user friendly in order to be accepted by both clinicians and patients. One of the claimed reasons for the market failure of Exubera\u00ae (Pfizer) was low patient compliance partly due to the complex inhaler device [76] . Owing to the great therapeutic potential of this alternative administration route, the last decades witnessed the development of devices with greater pulmonary deposition fractions of approximately 40-50% of the nominal dose as compared with the low levels between 10 and 15% verified in the past [61] .\r\n However, it is worth mentioning that this is a growing and dynamic field and innovative technologies are emerging. For example, powerassisted devices activated by vibration [77, 78] or pneumatic technology [79] , called active inhalers, have been developed for the delivery of systemically active drugs that have narrow therapeutic windows and for inhalatory nano-DDS [60] . Also, the development of adjusted inhalers that present specific inhalation patterns that are useful for the treatment of certain pulmonary diseases can be given attention [61] . It is also important to consider the cost of the device and its impact on the final product price. A balanced price\/therapeutic efficacy relationship is a crucial factor that can limit the clinical application of a certain product.\r\n Severe infections are frequently induced by resistant strains and\/or intracellular pathogens, thus making their treatment complex. Bacterial pathogens such as M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium intracellulare, and Legionella pneumophila, responsible for different pulmonary diseases, present the capacity to overcome cellular defense mechanisms, infecting the cells (often phagocytic ones) and turning them into reservoirs [80] . Conventional anti-infectious drugs display some drawbacks limiting the effective and timely eradication of intracellular pathogens (Fig. 4) [80] . Also, some drugs display limited bioavailability in the target microorganism to exert its therapeutic effect. In this framework, nano-DDS could overcome such limitations and improve the therapeutic index and clinical relevance of such drugs. Liposomal amikacin [81, 82] , kanamycin [83] , streptomycin [84, 85] , gentamicin [86] , vancomycin and teicoplanin [87] present enhanced in vitro and\/or in vivo efficacy by reducing the viable bacteria counts of Mycobacterium avium-Mycobacterium intracellulare complex (MAC), M. tuberculosis, Klebsiella pneumonia and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Nevertheless, in some cases, the pulmonary biodistribution of the different drugs was low or absent due to the poor lung targeting and accumulation properties of some of these formulations [84, 85] . This could be overcome by the development of particles targeted to the lung (e.g. MiKasome\u00ae, NeXstar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) [88] or by the localized delivery by inhalation.\r\n Due to their membrane-like structure, liposomes can fuse with the microorganism's membranes and deliver high drug cargos into the cytoplasm, saturating their drug efflux pumps [45] . On the other hand, micelles of poloxamers present the capacity to inhibit the efflux systems [89] . Other nanoparticles can be adsorbed to the microorganism's surface and serve as a depot for the encapsulated drug or to be taken up by infected cells, increasing the availability of the anti-infectious drug and overcoming drug resistance [45] . It is also possible to target the nanoparticles to surface receptors of microorganisms to further improve their therapeutic efficacy (e.g. lectin-decorated nanoparticles).\r\n Many inhaled anti-infectious drugs formulated in microparticle systems have proved the usefulness of inhalation as an effective route of administration to treat infectious diseases. Inhaled rifampicin-loaded PLGA microspheres efficiently reduced the pulmonary burden of M. tuberculosis and presented lower toxicity compared to the free drug [90, 91] . Also, ofloxacin-loaded hyaluronan microspheres administered intratracheally were more efficiently delivered into the lungs and underwent greater uptake by alveolar macrophages than intratracheal ofloxacin solution and i.v. or oral ofloxacin\/hyaluronan microspheres [92] .\r\n Proof-of-concept studies of inhaled nano-DDS to treat lung and systemic infections were reported by several research groups (Table 1) . However, as mentioned above, the properties of the encapsulated drug and the pharmaceutical excipients on the one hand, and the conditions of the production and the aerosolization process on the other hand greatly affect the performance of the final formulation. Thus, the comparison and the extrapolation of data between different studies are difficult. For example, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC)\/cholesterol (4:1) liposomes intended to inhalation and prepared using the same conditions efficiently encapsulated isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethionamide, but did not encapsulate rifampicin and streptomycin [93] . Conversely, in another study, rifampicin was efficiently incorporated into DSPC\/cholesterol (2:1) liposomes using a similar preparation protocol [67] . \r\n Due to its low water solubility, rifampicin is the focus of studies regarding encapsulation into different nanocarriers. Poly(ethylene oxide)-b-distearoylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine (mPEG-DSPE) micelles were proposed as carriers for rifampicin, although their therapeutic efficacy was not assessed [94] . Rifampicin was entrapped with high encapsulation efficiency into these micelles that sustained its release over 3 days in vitro. Formulations presented a fraction of fine particles of approximately 40% after nebulization [94] , an acceptable value that can be increased through system optimization. In another study, liposomal DPIs were developed and assessed as a platform for rifampicin inhalation [95] . The cryoprotectant used during the freeze-drying process influenced the aerosolization properties of the formulations. Between trehalose, mannitol and lactose, mannitol presented the best results regarding fine particle fraction and mean aerodynamic diameter [95] . The coating of the liposomes with muco-adhesive polymers such as chitosan improved the encapsulation efficiency of rifampicin but it distinctly affected the nebulization properties of the formulations as well as their cytotoxicity, that were intimately associated with the composition [96] . Nevertheless, the fine tuning of the liposome composition and considering that the muco-adhesiveness of the systems was enhanced [96] , it was expected that the lung accumulation of rifampicin, and thus its therapeutic effect, would be increased, making this a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic index of inhaled rifampicin. Aiming to avoid the administration of multiple medicines on a daily basis, Zahoor et al. developed alginate-chitosan NPs loaded simultaneously with isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide [97] . Around 80% of the nebulized formulation presented a mean aerodynamic diameter of 1.1 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcm, suitable for inhalation. Biodistribution studies performed in guinea pigs showed the presence of the drugs in plasma for a period exceeding 10 days, the drugs being detected in the lungs, liver and spleen in concentrations that were above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for up to 15 days (Fig. 5) . In contrast, free drugs administered by the same route were cleared after 24 h. In addition, inhalation of nanoparticles in a regimen of one administration every (Table 2) . Furthermore, there was no evidence of any biochemical hepatotoxicity [97] . Similar results were obtained by the same group using SLNs [98] , PLGA [99] and wheat germ agglutinin-PLGA [100] nanoparticles containing rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide, though these formulations required higher plasma residence time and different dose regimens. The existence of receptors for lectins in the alveolar epithelium could potentiate the absorption of drugs encapsulated into lectin-functionalized nanoparticles [100] . These modified systems emerge as a promising approach because they would allow the reduction of the dosing frequency and, by doing so, the improvement of patient compliance. At the same time, the cost-benefit balance should be thoroughly assessed for each one of them to ensure patient affordability. Other nano-DDS loaded with kanamycin [101] , isoniazid, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, rifampicin or ethionamide [67, 93] have been developed. However, their aerosolization properties and therapeutic efficacy in TB were not assessed.\r\n As stated above, nosocomial respiratory infections challenge the currently available therapy and represent a serious problem in healthcare units. The encapsulation of antibacterial drugs and their pulmonary administration improve their therapeutic index and leads to the reduction of the dose required to reach the local MIC. A liposomal DPI of ciprofloxacin presenting a mean aerodynamic diameter of 2.8 \u00b1 1 \u03bcm and 60% of fine particle fraction appeared as a possible formulation for the treatment of respiratory infections by the inhalatory route. Similar results were obtained by Desai et al. using liposomes loaded with ciprofloxacin and CM3, a peptide with antimicrobial properties [102] . In another study, inhaled ciprofloxacin\/liposomes provided protection against a lethal pulmonary tularemia murine model. Unlike untreated (control) and free inhaled ciprofloxacin treated mice, one single dose of the liposomal formulation resulted in at least 86% of survival after 14 days [103] . Inhaled liposomal tobramycin was therapeutically more effective than the conventional inhalatory formulation (Tobi\u00ae, Patho-Genesis Canada Ltee) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a multiple Cyclodextrin complexes Aspergillus fumigatus Nebulizer [115] dose treatment conducted in infected rats [104] . These findings were explained by differences in the pulmonary pharmacokinetic profile of the different formulations. Liposomes display a greater area under curve (3890 \u00b1 560 \u03bcg h\/lungs) and elimination half-life time (34.4 \u00b15 .0 h) with respect to the conventional formulation (663 \u00b1 89 \u03bcg h\/lungs and 14.0 \u00b1 4.0 h) [104] . Similar results were obtained in the treatment of rats infected with Burkholderia cepacia using the same formulation [105] . In another study, inhaled liposomal polymyxin B presented higher pulmonary levels of the drug (42.6 \u00b1 6.2 \u03bcg\/paired lungs) compared to the free drug (8.2 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcg\/paired lungs) and reduced the lung injuries resulting from P. aeruginosa infection in rats [106] . The same formulation was shown to possess lower MIC values for various Gram-negative bacteria including resistant strains of P. aeruginosa [107] . Also, a silver-carbene complex with antimicrobial properties was encapsulated in L-tyrosine polyphosphate nanoparticles and nebulized to mice infected with P. aeruginosa. The treatment reduced the number of bacteria in lungs and spleen and increased the survival of the animals [108] . \r\n Recently, stearic acid-grafted chitosan oligosaccharide (SA-CSO) micelles were developed for the pulmonary administration of AmB [38] . AmB-loaded micelles presented the same antifungal activity of Fungioze\u00ae but lower toxicity. The formulations were efficiently nebulized using an air-jet nebulizer presenting up to 52% of fine particle fraction [38] . Also, in the treatment of fungal infections, itraconazole: polysorbate 80:poloxamer 407 nanostructured aggregates administered by inhalation to mice presented higher lung concentrations, lung-to-serum ratios, improved survival of infected animals and lower toxicity than orally administered itraconazole formulations, in a 12 day study [109] [110] [111] [112] . No signs of lung inflammation or changes in pulmonary histology were detected [113] . It is worth stressing that a lower drug dose was required to achieve lung and serum therapeutic levels using inhaled formulation compared to oral administration [110] . Itraconazole nanostructured aggregates composed of mannitol and lecithin prepared by an ultra-rapid freezing technique also presented promising features such as aerosolization suitable for deep lung delivery, high lung deposition and systemic absorption, making them a promising approach to treat invasive fungal infections [114] . Other studies assessing the encapsulation of newer antifungal agents, e.g., voriconazole-sulfoalkyl ether\/CD complexes to treat pulmonary fungal infections by inhalation were patented [115] . Nebulization of complexes produces a fine particle fraction of about 70% of the nebulized droplets [115] . Apart from the enhanced aqueous solubility of voriconazole, the formulation led to a pronounced increase of the accumulation in lungs and to a more limited clearance from plasma, these phenomena increase its therapeutic efficacy in Aspergillus fumigatus-infected animals; greater survival extents and reduced lung damage were observed. CDs are proposed not only as the carrier in nano-DDS but also as therapeutic agent in the treatment pulmonary infections. Due to its structure, the Per-6-[(N \u03b1 -Boc-L-ornithinyl)amino]-\u03b2-cyclodextrin displayed the capacity to bind to \u03b1-hemolysin. In addition to the in vitro results that showed the prevention of alpha-hemolysin-induced lysis of human alveolar epithelial cells, this CD prevented the mortality in a S. aureus pneumonia murine model [116] . However, the compound was administered intravenously, being necessary to perform pulmonary administration to determine its feasibility as an inhalatory therapeutic agent.\r\n Being a first-line defense mechanism against microorganisms entering the lung via the airways and, consequently, reservoirs of many pathogens, alveolar macrophages have drawn special attention as a relevant clinical target. Various nano-DDS of different drugs have been developed to selectively deliver the therapeutic cargo to alveolar macrophages, presenting positive results in the treatment of both fungal and bacterial infections [34, 37, 117] . The targeting of drugs to macrophages could be achieved by tailoring physicochemical properties of the carriers like size, hydrophilicity, composition, surface charge and surface ligands [118] . Different ligands such as galactomannan, [37, 117, 119] . In this context, Vyas and Khatri published an interesting review regarding the use of liposomes as delivery systems to alveolar macrophages [120] . Poly(\u03b5-caprolactone)-b-poly(ethyleneglycol)-b-poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) micelles and chitosan nanoparticles functionalized with hydrolyzed galactomannan were taken up by murine macrophages and promoted increased intracellular levels of rifampicin to a higher extent than non-functionalized particles [121] . Rifampicin-loaded liposomes produced as pressurized formulations were efficiently aerosolized and deposited in the lower airways. The encapsulation of rifampicin led to a reduction of the Mycobacterium smegmatis viability inside macrophages from 45.7 \u00b1 4.7% to 21.6 \u00b1 3.1% for the free drug and phosphatidylcholine: cholesterol:dicetylphosphate (PC:Chol:DCP) liposomes, respectively (Fig. 6 ). This effect was further increased by anchoring MBSA (10.9 \u00b1 2.1%) and O-SAP (7.1 \u00b1 1.6%) to the surface of the liposomes [117] . Authors speculated that the ideal 0% of viability could be reached by a repeated dosing regimen. Being taken up by macrophages, ligandmodified liposomes accumulated in the lungs for more prolonged time and they were cleared more slowly through the blood stream (as suggested by in vivo biodistribution studies in Wistar rats), exerting their effect locally and more efficiently [117] . This approach appears to be a feasible strategy for the treatment of pulmonary TB.\r\n Passive targeting to alveolar macrophages is also possible, although it is expected that functionalized liposomes will present better results as they will be taken up selectively by the cellular reservoir of the bacillus. Thus, rifampicin-loaded phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol:P90 (PC: Chol:P90) liposomes were stable in the presence of mucus and underwent deposition in the lower airways, when administered to rats. Most importantly, in vitro studies showed that liposomes enhanced the uptake of rifampicin by alveolar macrophages and inhibited the growth of intracellular Mycobacterium avium even when a lower dose of rifampicin was used [122] . Rifampicin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles also result in higher uptake in vitro and in vivo by alveolar macrophages when compared to microspheres of similar composition [123] , indicating that the size of the particles influences the cellular uptake.\r\n The pulmonary administration and antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin-loaded liposomes against the intracellular bacteria were also assessed [119] . The uptake of ciprofloxacin by alveolar macrophages and the pulmonary accumulation after inhalation were higher for liposomal formulations than for the drug solution, the effect being greater for PAM-modified liposomes [119] . The antibacterial activity against various intracellular bacteria such as Chlamydophila pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes and Francisella tularensis as estimated by pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic analyses, and it was higher using liposomal systems. This enabled a significant reduction of the administered dose [119] . Yet, efficacy studies using the pathogens need to be performed to support the results. Regarding fungal infections, OPM and OPP were used as ligands recognizable by mannose receptors to target AmB-loaded phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol (PC:Chol) liposomes to alveolar macrophages [37] . The PC:Cholmolar ratio of 7:3 presented the best relationship between AmB encapsulation efficiency and hemolysis-related toxicity. However, increasing the percentage of cholesterol in the liposome led to a decrease in the encapsulation efficiency and toxicity. pMDIs prepared with these formulations showed acceptable percentage of particles deposited in lower airways in vitro, although smaller than the free drug solution. Additionally, after administration to rats, liposomes accumulated more effectively in the lungs and prolonged the release with respect to the free drug. The presence of OPM and OPP improved the pulmonary accumulation of AmB, showing better results than the OPM-anchored liposomes (Fig. 7) [37] . Efficacy studies regarding these formulations are needed for further evaluation.\r\n Another relevant discovery is related to tuftsin, a tetrapeptide of Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg, that specifically binds to macrophages potentiating its phagocytosis, immunogenic response and bactericidal activity [124] . Besides its antimicrobial activity, grafting tuftsin to the surface of liposomes provides a useful delivery system for many drugs to treat among other infections TB [125] , leishmaniasis [39] and aspergillosis [126] . Still the pulmonary administration of such formulations needs to be assessed.\r\n Inhalation of drugs to treat both local and systemic pathologies has gained much attention in the last decades. The anatomo-physiological characteristics of the respiratory system make them a promising non-invasive administration route that minimizes systemic exposure and adverse effects. However, despite the advantages presented over other administration routes, inhalation requires formulations with fine tuned properties (e.g., aerodynamic properties) as well as the implementation of special delivery devices that make its development and production under an industrial setup many times more difficult and expensive. This explains the small number of inhalatory formulations available in the market. Nonetheless, scientific developments in the fields of both drug delivery and inhalation device technology over the last years have increased interest in the pulmonary delivery of drugs. One of the main developments has been in the field of nanotechnology, where a multitude of nano-DDS have been developed and tested.\r\n The main advantages of the abovementioned DDS include the sustained release of drugs over longer periods of time, prevention of premature drug degradation, improvement in drug absorption, enhancement of tissue penetration and accumulation and reduction of drug toxicity. Regarding anti-infectious drugs, the achievement of the same therapeutic index using fewer drug doses as well as a lower dosing frequency is definitely advantageous since this improves patient compliance and adherence to the treatment. In addition, targeted systems to alveolar macrophages improve bactericidal activity on intracellular pathogens, overcoming the limitations of conventional formulations. Therefore, inhalatory nano-DDS represent a promising approach and a hope in the treatment of respiratory infections and can be especially valuable to fight intrahospital multidrug resistant strains.\r\n Although the results obtained so far are too preliminary, the steady increase in the development of such systems and the proof of their therapeutic relevance in preclinical models and clinical trials could be certainly envisaged in the near future.","sha":"bf1ef8990f25eb86c24864f13004da9415d02d70","publish_time":"2013-11-30","authors":"Andrade, Fernanda; Rafael, Diana; Videira, Mafalda; Ferreira, Domingos; Sosnik, Alejandro; Sarmento, Bruno","journal":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","doi":"10.1016\/j.addr.2013.07.020","Title":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","H index":278.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Macrophage \r\n Inhalation of compounds as a means to treat diseases is used since ancient times. The oldest reports came from China and India around 2000 BC and are related to the inhalation of smoke from burned herbal preparations based on Ephedra sinica or Daturastramonium to treat asthma, respectively [1, 2] . Through the years, many compounds and mixtures were proposed and used to treat different diseases using various methods for inhalation. Despite inhalation being started as a route to treat diseases constrained to the respiratory tract, with scientific and technological advances, a change in paradigm took place and over the years, inhalation has been clinically evaluated and used to treat both local and systemic diseases [8] such as asthma [9] , TB [10] and other bacterial infections [11] , influenza virus infection [12] , fungal infections [13] , cystic fibrosis [14] , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [15] , diabetes [16] or cancer [17, 18] . Driven by the progress in the nanomedicine field, many researchers developed innovative formulations with improved biopharmaceutical features [21, 22] , allowing the pulmonary administration of many drugs that otherwise could not be administered by inhalation. This work reviews the state-of-on overcoming drug resistance. Infections of the lower respiratory tract are among the top three major causes of morbidity worldwide and first in lowincome countries, being responsible for approximately 3.5 million deaths annually [25] . Pneumonia is a common infectious pulmonary disease that has many etiological agents, including bacteria, viruses and fungi such as Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumonia, Moraxella catarrhalis, human respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila or Pneumocystis jiroveci. TB is an infectious disease caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis that primarily but not exclusively affects the lungs. In addition to the development of resistance, the difficulty to treat TB stems from the fact that when administered systemically many anti-TB drugs fail to reach the lungs or penetrate into the alveolar macrophages, the reservoir of M. tuberculosis [31, 33] . There are a variety of fungal infections such as histoplasmosis (Histoplasma capsulatum), sporotrichosis (Sporothrix schenkii), blastomycosis (Blastomyces dermatitidis), coccidioidomycosis (Coccidioides spp.), infection that can cause pulmonary injury with different severities [35] . Actually, there are a variety of anti-fungal drugs available in the market generally administered orally or intravenously. Vaccination is the primary means of preventing and controlling viral infections, especially annual outbreaks of influenza. At the moment, few drugs are available to treat pulmonary viral infections like amantadine (Symmetrel\u00ae, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), rimantadine (Flumadine\u00ae, Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae, Hoffmann-La Roche) usually used in young, elderly, and other groups of patients with other serious medical conditions. Currently these drugs are administered by the oral route. Despite the advances seen in the development of new antibiotics, drug resistance remains a huge public health problem. According to the World Health Organization around 440,000 new cases of MDR-TB emerge annually, causing at least 150,000 deaths worldwide [43] . The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a drug are highly dependent on its physical and chemical features and it is influenced by the type of formulation used to deliver it. Moreover, it has generated a profuse intellectual property platform. However, and despite the fact that nanomedicine began as a discipline almost half a century ago, only a few nano-DDS have found their way to the market [48] . In this context, many research groups have consolidated the concept of pulmonary delivery of drugs using nano-DDS. The therapeutic efficiency of anti-infectious drugs can be improved by enhancing their solubility, pulmonary accumulation and further intracellular delivery thus increasing the local concentration of drugs, reducing the dose and frequency of administration and minimizing at the same time the drugs' systemic side effects [33, 54] . The respiratory system provides a non-invasive route of delivery with a large surface area, a thin epithelial barrier, extensive blood supply and blood flow, and lower enzymatic activity compared to other organs in the body (e.g., liver and gastrointestinal tract). 1)) plays an important role as it governs the particle deposition pattern. Besides drugs, pharmaceutical excipients constitute an integral part of pharmaceutical formulations. DPI were developed as a response to the limitations regarding stability and environmental aspects of pMDI and nebulizers [60] . In DPI, the coarse carrier particle is the major component of the formulation (N95%, w\/w). It provides bulk properties and reduces the cohesion forces between drug particles, facilitating the aerosol dispersion and defining deposition pattern [62] . Studies show that PC-based liposomes do not affect or slightly decrease the viability of human A549 alveolar cells after 24 h of exposure. Other compounds used in the development of nano-DDS such as dextran, alginate, carrageenan or gelatin also possess GRAS status. It should be mentioned that that regulations apply not only to the material itself but also to its source. Chitosan does not present significant toxicity to pulmonary tissue and cells after inhalation [68, 69] . Cyclodextrins (CDs) have been tested as complexing agents and excipients of inhalatory formulations. This \"carrierless\" strategy avoided the need for long and expensive safety studies, facilitating the authorization by regulatory agencies. Since the device greatly influences the particle aerosolization and deposition pattern, the choice of the appropriate device for a specific formulation is one of the most timeconsuming and challenging stages of the development phase and it is imperative to ensure the drug efficacy [62, 74] . However, it is worth mentioning that this is a growing and dynamic field and innovative technologies are emerging. Also, some drugs display limited bioavailability in the target microorganism to exert its therapeutic effect. Many inhaled anti-infectious drugs formulated in microparticle systems have proved the usefulness of inhalation as an effective route of administration to treat infectious diseases. or oral ofloxacin\/hyaluronan microspheres [92] . For example, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC)\/cholesterol (4:1) liposomes intended to inhalation and prepared using the same conditions efficiently encapsulated isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethionamide, but did not encapsulate rifampicin and streptomycin [93] . Conversely, in another study, rifampicin was efficiently incorporated into DSPC\/cholesterol (2:1) liposomes using a similar preparation protocol [67] . Due to its low water solubility, rifampicin is the focus of studies regarding encapsulation into different nanocarriers. Poly(ethylene oxide)-b-distearoylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine (mPEG-DSPE) micelles were proposed as carriers for rifampicin, although their therapeutic efficacy was not assessed [94] . Formulations presented a fraction of fine particles of approximately 40% after nebulization [94] , an acceptable value that can be increased through system optimization. Between trehalose, mannitol and lactose, mannitol presented the best results regarding fine particle fraction and mean aerodynamic diameter [95] . A liposomal DPI of ciprofloxacin presenting a mean aerodynamic diameter of 2.8 \u00b1 1 \u03bcm and 60% of fine particle fraction appeared as a possible formulation for the treatment of respiratory infections by the inhalatory route. Similar results were obtained by Desai et al. using liposomes loaded with ciprofloxacin and CM3, a peptide with antimicrobial properties [102] . In another study, inhaled ciprofloxacin\/liposomes provided protection against a lethal pulmonary tularemia murine model. In another study, inhaled liposomal polymyxin B presented higher pulmonary levels of the drug (42.6 \u00b1 6.2 \u03bcg\/paired lungs) compared to the free drug (8.2 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcg\/paired lungs) and reduced the lung injuries resulting from P. aeruginosa infection in rats [106] . No signs of lung inflammation or changes in pulmonary histology were detected [113] . Other studies assessing the encapsulation of newer antifungal agents, e.g., voriconazole-sulfoalkyl ether\/CD complexes to treat pulmonary fungal infections by inhalation were patented [115] . CDs are proposed not only as the carrier in nano-DDS but also as therapeutic agent in the treatment pulmonary infections. This approach appears to be a feasible strategy for the treatment of pulmonary TB. Most importantly, in vitro studies showed that liposomes enhanced the uptake of rifampicin by alveolar macrophages and inhibited the growth of intracellular Mycobacterium avium even when a lower dose of rifampicin was used [122] . Yet, efficacy studies using the pathogens need to be performed to support the results. However, increasing the percentage of cholesterol in the liposome led to a decrease in the encapsulation efficiency and toxicity. Additionally, after administration to rats, liposomes accumulated more effectively in the lungs and prolonged the release with respect to the free drug. Efficacy studies regarding these formulations are needed for further evaluation. Besides its antimicrobial activity, grafting tuftsin to the surface of liposomes provides a useful delivery system for many drugs to treat among other infections TB [125] , leishmaniasis [39] and aspergillosis [126] . Still the pulmonary administration of such formulations needs to be assessed. Although the results obtained so far are too preliminary, the steady increase in the development of such systems and the proof of their therapeutic relevance in preclinical models and clinical trials could be certainly envisaged in the near future."},{"Unnamed: 0":19,"Unnamed: 0.1":19,"doc_id":"0b4f6501ac34ce2350bcdb121130247e2523d928","title":"Pulmonary delivery of therapeutic siRNA","abstract":"Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has a huge potential for the treatment or prevention of various lung diseases.

This review focuses on the latest development of pulmonary delivery of siRNA for the treatment of various lung diseases.","text_body":"RNA interference (RNAi) has huge therapeutic potential in treating many diseases by silencing the expression of the target gene in a posttranscriptional manner. The mechanism of RNAi has been extensively reviewed in the literature [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In brief, RNAi can be achieved artificially by three major ways: (i) introducing long double stranded RNA (dsRNA) which is cleaved into small interfering RNA (siRNA) by the enzyme Dicer in the cytoplasm, leading to the degradation of target mRNA; (ii) introducing plasmid DNA encodes for short hairpin RNA (shRNA) which is processed by Dicer into siRNA; and (iii) introducing small interfering RNA (siRNA) directly to initiate the mRNA degradation process.\r\n For the last two decades, scientists have been investigating the use of nucleic acids including DNA and antisense oligonucleotide as therapeutic agents. The biggest hurdle we are encountering is delivery, and the same problem applies to RNAi therapy. Being negatively charged hydrophilic macromolecules that are highly susceptible to nuclease degradation, nucleic acids are incapable of crossing the biological membrane on their own to reach the site of action. A delivery vector is therefore required to protect the therapeutic nucleic acids from enzymatic degradation, facilitate cellular uptake and release nucleic acids at the site of action inside the cells. Amongst the types of nucleic acids that are involved in the RNAi, siRNA is the most popular candidate being studied in RNAi therapy. Introduction of long dsRNA (typically consist of 500 to 1000 base pairs) is known to induce interferon (IFN) response in mammalian cells [7, 8] , rendering it unsuitable for RNAi therapy, whereas siRNA (typically consist of 21-23 base pairs) can avoid the INF response. From the delivery perspective, siRNA has advantage over the plasmid DNA encoding shRNA. In order for DNA to be properly expressed, it must enter the nucleus where transcription takes place. Nuclear entry is an extremely inefficient process and this is indeed considered to be one of the biggest barriers to the success of gene therapy. On the other hand, siRNA targets the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is located in the cytoplasm. Although shRNA has a higher gene silencing potency than siRNA [9, 10] , the relatively ease of delivery makes siRNA a better candidate for RNAi therapy. In fact, delivery of siRNA has more success than other RNAi molecules. In 2004, the first human clinical trial of RNAi therapy was initiated for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with siRNA targeting VEGF-receptor 1 delivered intravitreally [11, 12] . Since then a number of clinical trials of siRNA therapy are being conducted for different conditions [13] , including solid tumor cancers [14] and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection [15, 16] . Table 1 shows the summary of clinical trials of siRNA therapy.\r\n RNAi can be potentially used to treat or prevent diseases affecting the airways, such as lung cancer [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , various types of respiratory infectious diseases [16, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , airway inflammatory diseases [37] [38] [39] and cystic fibrosis [40] . siRNA delivery to the lungs could be achieved either by local delivery or systemic delivery. The former route offers several important benefits over the latter, such as a lower dose of siRNA is required, reduction of undesirable systemic side effects and improved siRNA stability due to lower nuclease activity in the airways than in the serum. Furthermore lungs could potentially serve as an interesting site for delivering siRNA for systemic effect due to its high vascularization, large surface area and ultra thin epithelium of the alveoli [41] . All these factors allow efficient and rapid siRNA absorption.\r\n The process of pulmonary siRNA delivery is summarized in Fig. 1 . There are several ways to administer siRNA locally into the lungs. Inhalation is the most common and the easiest method for pulmonary drug delivery and could be applied to siRNA delivery. siRNA for inhalation can be formulated into liquid aerosol or dry powder aerosol. The intranasal route is another common way to deliver siRNA into the airways due to the ease of administration and the intranasal siRNA preparation can be easily administered into the nasal cavity as nasal suspension. Intratracheal route of administration is also employed to deliver siRNA into the lungs. However this method of administration is relatively invasive and non-physiologic [42] . It is generally considered to be used in animal studies only rather than for clinical applications. Regardless of the administration route, it is very important to maintain siRNA stability and biological activity during manufacturing and delivery.\r\n Similar to DNA delivery, both viral and non-viral vectors are being employed to deliver siRNA. Viruses are extremely efficient nucleic acids delivery vectors as they are evolved to transfer their genetic material into the host cells. To enable viruses to deliver nucleic acids for therapeutic use, the viruses must first be genetically engineered to remove their virulence. The main advantage of using viral vectors is their high transduction efficiency compared to transfection by nonviral methods. Viruses such as adenovirus [43] [44] [45] , adeno-associated virus [46] , and lentivirus [47, 48] are being investigated to deliver siRNA to lung cells. Despite their high nucleic acids transfer efficiency, there are safety concerns regarding the use of viral vectors.\r\n From the lessons we have learnt in DNA delivery, there are high risks associated with the utilization of viral vectors [49] . Immune response to viruses is the major challenge to viral delivery [50] . It limits the effectiveness of therapy in repeated administration. Severe case of immune response can even lead to organ failure and the consequences could be fatal [51] . Furthermore, several types of virus may insert their genome randomly into the host chromosomes, disturbing gene function and resulting in insertional mutagenesis [52] [53] [54] . After the infamous Gelsinger case (18 years old volunteer Gelsinger died in a gene therapy trial using adenovirus) [51] and the French X-SCID case (one third of children developed leukemia in a gene therapy trial using retrovirus) [55] , it is not hard to imagine that the chance of using viral vectors in any type of human nucleic acids therapy to get approval from the FDA will be extremely slim. The viral vectors are excellent agents to deliver siRNA for proof-of-concept studies, but appear to lack of real clinical application because of the safety issues. Alternative way to deliver siRNA is by non-viral methods which include any method that does not involve the use of viruses. The therapeutic siRNA are either administered directly into the site of action or delivered by non-viral vectors. Commonly used non-viral vectors for siRNA delivery include lipids, polymers and peptides. Thomas et al. reviewed the non-viral siRNA delivery to the lung [56] and the review (published in 2007) focused on the delivery of siRNA for the treatment of three different lung virus infections: influenza, respiratory syncytial virus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The field of siRNA delivery has rapidly expanded since then and a good number of in vivo studies were carried out in the past few years to investigate the local delivery of siRNA against various lung diseases including lung cancer [57] , mycobacteria infection [36] , pulmonary fibrosis [58, 59] , respiratory alphaherpesvirus infection [31] , and other endogenous gene targets in the lungs [60, 61] . In this review, we present the latest development of siRNA therapy for the treatment of various lung diseases. We discuss the challenges to pulmonary drug administration and barriers to siRNA delivery to the lung, including both extracellular and intracellular barriers, with the focus on non-viral delivery methods. The findings of recent clinical studies of pulmonary siRNA therapy are also discussed.\r\n The pulmonary delivery of therapeutic macromolecules such as proteins and peptides has been investigated for over thirty years [41] . The challenges of siRNA delivery via the pulmonary route are similar to the delivery of other macromolecules. In order to develop an efficient siRNA pulmonary delivery system, it is important to understand the anatomical and physiological properties of the respiratory tract in the first place.\r\n The respiratory tract can be divided into two regions: (i) the conducting region which consists of nasal cavity, pharynx, trachea, bronchi and bronchioles; and (ii) the respiratory region which consists of the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli. The conducting region is responsible for air conductance and the respiratory region is where the gaseous exchange takes place. The most prominent feature of the respiratory tract is the high degree of branching. According to the Wiebel's model of lung, there are 24 generations in total. This highly branched structure comprises airways with varying length and diameter presents an early barrier to targeted pulmonary delivery. Many lung diseases affect the lower region of the lungs. For the therapeutic agents to reach the diseased area, they must follow the airstream around the bend along the branched airway to the deep lung area. The size of particles is an important factor in determining the site of deposition as illustrated in Fig. 2 [62] . In pulmonary delivery, size of particle is expressed in terms of aerodynamic diameter. Large particles (N6 \u03bcm aerodynamic diameter) carry high momentum and are more likely to be impacted on the airway wall at bifurcations instead of following the changing airstream. Therefore they are usually deposited higher up in the airway such as the back of the throat or pharynx. For small particles (b1 \u03bcm aerodynamic diameter), their movements are determined by Brownian motion. They are mostly exhaled during normal tidal breathing but pausing can enhance their deposition as the probability of the latter is proportional to the square root of time [63] . The optimal particle size for efficient deposition at the lower respiratory tract is found to be between 1 and 5 \u03bcm [41, 64] . As the particle size further decreases towards the nanoscale, deposition in the lung increases again due to the increasing diffusional mobility [65] . For nanoparticles that are less than 100 nm, they appear to settle effectively to the alveolar region with a fractional deposition of around 50%. However, these ultrafine particles usually enter the lungs as larger agglomerates which can be broken down relatively easily into smaller particles on deposition. Various elimination pathways for nanoparticles exist in the lungs, including coughing, dissolution, mucociliarly escalator, translocation from the airways to other sites, phagocytosis by macrophages and neuronal uptake. What has not been established is the quantitative relationship of these pathways [66] . Very little is known about exactly how siRNA is cleared from the lungs.\r\n Major barriers to pulmonary delivery include the mucociliary clearance action of the ciliated epithelial cells, and the presence of mucus, alveolar fluid and macrophages along different parts of the airways [67, 68] . Particles that are deposited on the ciliated cells are rapidly removed by mucociliary clearance and are eventually being coughed up or swallowed. The mucus lines the respiratory epithelium from the nasal cavity to the terminal bronchioles [69] . The major component of mucus is mucins which are glycosylated proteins. Mucus constitutes a physical barrier as it increases the viscosity of the moist surface of the lung epithelial cells, thereby reducing drug penetration and diffusion rate. The alveolar fluid is found on the surface of alveoli epithelium as a thin layer of pulmonary surfactant which comprises phospholipids and other surfactant proteins. It has been reported that the pulmonary surfactant severely impeded the transfection efficiency of lipid-based nucleic acids delivery system, but not polymer-based system [70] [71] [72] . The alveolar macrophages located in the alveoli rapidly engulf the foreign particles by phagocytosis as a defense mechanism [73] . The siRNA that is taken up into the macrophages are subsequently degraded inside the cells.\r\n At disease state, the physiological conditions of the airways might be altered and pose a huge impact on the efficiency of the pulmonary delivery system. During infection and inflammation, there is an increase in mucus secretion and the mucociliary clearance is impaired [73, 74] . The thickness, the viscosity and the composition of the mucus layer depend on the pathological condition and vary between individual [67] . It is important that these factors are being considered during the development of pulmonary delivery system for different therapeutic applications.\r\n To overcome the anatomical and physiological barriers of the lungs, several delivery strategies can be incorporated. Besides using particles with small aerodynamic diameter suitable for deposition in the lower airways, it has been reported that the use of large porous particles can effectively avoid phagocytosis by the alveolar macrophages and prolong retention time in the lungs [75] [76] [77] . Porous particles over 10 \u03bcm in geometric diameter usually have a smaller aerodynamic diameter so that they are within the ideal aerodynamic size range for effective lung deposition, but their actual geometric size is too large to be removed by macrophages. To overcome the mucus barrier, the use of mucolytic agents, such as nacystelyn which breaks down the three dimensional gel network of mucus, or the use of mucus inhibitor, such as glycopyrrolate which inhibit mucus secretion, could be considered [78] . However their clinical benefits are limited [67, 78] . Inhaled mannitol has been clinically proven to increase the mucus clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis or bronchietasis [79, 80] and to improve the hydration and surface properties of sputum [81] . Reducing the mucus barrier by mannitol inhalation prior to the delivery of siRNA may thus be beneficial. The use of ultrasound and magnetic field has also been reported to direct and control the site of deposition of nucleic acids delivery systems in the airways [82] [83] [84] .\r\n Once the siRNA has reached the surface of the target cells of the respiratory tract, assuming it successfully gets away with the extracellular barriers, it still has to cross the cellular membrane and gain access into the cytoplasm where RISC, the final target of siRNA, is located. siRNA is a negatively charged hydrophilic macromolecules with a molecular weight around 13 kDa. Base on its physicochemical properties, siRNA is not able to cross the biological membrane on its own. Therefore one of the main functions of a delivery vector is to facilitate the cellular uptake of siRNA.\r\n Endocytosis is the major cellular uptake pathway known to be involved in non-viral nucleic acids delivery [85] . For efficient endocytosis to occur, particles should be under 150 nm in size. Particles within this size range could also avoid macrophage uptake and thereby delayed lung clearance [86] . For particles that enter the respiratory tract as large aggregates, they must be redispersed or deaggregated into the appropriate size before endocytosis could take place. Yet there are several different types of endocytic pathways which in turn affect the set of barriers the macromolecules may encounter, and the eventual fate of molecules could be very different [85] . Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the major and the bestcharacterized endocytic pathway that occurs constitutively in all mammalian cells. Particles that are taken up by the cells through this pathway are enclosed in clathrin-coated vesicles. They are then transported into early endosomes, which fuse to form late endosomes and subsequently into the lysosomes. During the process, the pH inside the vesicles drops gradually to as low as pH 5.0 in the lysosomes where degradative enzymes including nuclease are present. Therefore the therapeutic siRNA must be able to exit from the endosomes\/lysosomes into the cytoplasm before it is degraded by the nuclease (Fig. 1 ).\r\n There are several strategies that can be employed to promote endosomal escape of siRNA. Polymers such as polyethylenimine (PEI) have the ability to trigger endosomal release. The 'proton sponge hypothesis' suggested that due to the high buffering capacity of PEI over a wide range of pH, the polymer becomes protonated as the pH drops inside the endosomes. This leads to the influx of chloride ions, protons and subsequently water into the endosomes. Eventually high osmotic pressure develops, causing the endosomes to burst open and release the contents into the cytoplasm [87] . However the cellular effect of 'endosomes bursting' has not been properly discussed or evaluated and the PEI is also known to be associated with toxicity problem. Another strategy is to incorporate pH sensitive fusogenic peptides to the delivery system. Fusogenic peptides such as GALA [88] , KALA [89, 90] INF7 [91] etc., have been employed in siRNA delivery both in vitro and in vivo. These peptides have the ability to undergo pH-dependent conformational change. At low pH, they adopt a 'membrane-disrupting' conformation and destabilize the endosomal membrane, thereby releasing the contents of endosomes into the cytoplasm.\r\n Apart from clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis is another mechanism that is involved in the uptake of nucleic acids delivery systems [85] . After internalization, the delivery systems are enclosed in caveolin-coated vesicles called caveosomes which are non-acidic. Nuclease and other degradative enzymes are absence in caveosomes. The delivery systems can be directly transported to the Golgi and\/or endoplasmic reticulum, thereby avoiding the lysosomal degradation. Since caveolin is abundantly expressed in many cell types including lung tissues [92, 93] , it is an important route of cell internalization in pulmonary delivery, and perhaps a more efficient route compared to clathrin-mediated endocytosis, especially with the delivery system that lacks the ability to escape from the acidic endosomal compartments.\r\n The entrapment of siRNA inside the endosomes\/lysosomes not only leads to the degradation of the nucleic acids, but may also trigger the activation of innate immunity. There has been evidence suggested that synthetic siRNA can be recognized by the toll-like receptors (TLRs), TLR7 and TLR8, inside the endosomal compartments, thereby stimulating the innate immune response [94] [95] [96] . 2\u2032 modification of siRNA could circumvent the problem but this approach may adversely affect the gene silencing efficiency. Alternatively, early escape from or completely bypassing the endosomes during the intracellular delivery process could perhaps avoid this immunostimulatory activity of siRNA. Moschos et al. [61] reported that when TAT-conjugated siRNA was administered to the lung of the mouse, no immune response was observed. However when penetratin-conjugated siRNA was administered in the same way, innate immune response was observed, possibly through the activation of TLR. Since siRNA, TAT or penetratin alone did not induce innate immune responses, the different fate between TAT-conjugated and penetratin-conjugated siRNA systems could only be explained by their different cellular uptake mechanism. This study demonstrated the importance of the cellular uptake pathway and the intracellular trafficking in establishing the safety profile as well as the efficiency of siRNA delivery.\r\n Lastly, phagocytosis is another cellular uptake mechanism that occurs in the respiratory tract. Since this route of uptake can only be performed by specialized cells such as alveolar macrophages, it is not expected to play an important role in siRNA delivery [85] . Unless the therapeutic siRNA is aimed to target the alveolar macrophages, e.g. treatment of mycobacterium infection, this pathway should be totally avoided, as molecules being taken up this pathway are eventually degraded in the phagolysosomes of the cells.\r\n Direct pulmonary delivery in humans is achieved by inhalation of aerosol generated by either an inhaler or nebulizer. Before a new therapeutic agent is used in a human clinical trial, it must demonstrate pre-clinical efficacy in suitable animal model with good translatability to humans [97] . There is no exception to therapeutic siRNA. In additional to inhalation, intratracheal and intranasal route are often used to deliver therapeutic agents including siRNA to the lungs of animals because of the relatively simple setup. The summary of the in vivo studies of non-viral siRNA delivery to the lung is provided in Table 2 , and the routes of administration commonly used in these studies are illustrated in Fig. 3 . Intratracheal and intranasal methods may not be practical in the clinical setting. Intratracheal route is an invasive method of delivery which is not appropriate for human use. The success in delivering siRNA via intranasal route in rodents which is an obligate nose breathers cannot be extrapolated to human use because of the very different lung anatomy [98] . It is therefore important to take into consideration the route of administration in animal studies when assessing the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of a formulation for lung delivery.\r\n Inhalation is the most popular and a non-invasive way to deliver therapeutic agents into the lungs. Three main types of inhalation devices are currently available to deliver drug to the lung through inhalation. These include metered dose inhalers (MDIs), dry powder inhalers (DPIs) and nebulizers. With appropriate modification and optimization, these devices could be applied to pulmonary delivery of siRNA. To date, MDIs are the most commonly used inhalers. They are pressurized dosage form in which the therapeutic agents are either dissolved or suspended in propellants such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs). The propellants serve to provide a driving pressure to aerosolize the drug for inhalation into the respiratory tract. However both CFCs and HFAs are known to have environmental impact. The compatibility of formulation with propellants is another potential problem and the lung deposition is generally poor with MDIs. It may not be the best direction for developing inhalable siRNA.\r\n DPIs are aerosol systems in which drugs are inhaled as clouds of dry particles. The use of DPIs appears to be a promising way to deliver siRNA to the lungs as they demonstrated successful in vivo delivery of other therapeutic macromolecules including insulin [108] , parathyroid hormone [109] and low molecular weight heparin [110, 111] . The formulation challenges and potential solutions for delivery of macromolecules such as proteins as powder aerosols have been reviewed [112] . Formulating biological macromolecules as powders for aerosol delivery is a challenge as it requires not only flowability and dispersibility of the powders but also biochemical stability of the macromolecules. To satisfy the latter requirement, proteins are usually formulated in amorphous glasses which are, however, physically unstable and tend to crystallize with inter-particulate bond formation and loss of powder dispersiblity. In addition, the biochemical stability requirement limits the manufacturing processes that can be used for protein powder production. Similar issues will be encountered for siRNA. Nevertheless, possible ways to tackle these challenges have been addressed [112] . The inhaled dry powder form of insulin (Exubera, marketed by Pfizer) was approved in Europe and the US for the treatment of diabetes in 2006 [113] . Although the product was withdrawn from the market in the subsequent year, Pfizer stressed that disappointing sales is the major reason for the withdrawal rather than safety or efficacy issues [114] . The safety profile of inhaled insulin was indeed reassuring and the efficacy was not inferior to the conventional injection formulations [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] . A second inhalable insulin product in dry powder form, Afresa, is currently awaiting for FDA approval. This encourages further development of dry powder form of macromolecules for inhalation.\r\n There are different designs of DPI device and their delivery performance may vary. The key advantages of DPIs are the improved stability and sterility of biomolecules over liquid aerosols, and the propellant-free formulation [120] . Inhalable dry powder forms of proteins and peptides are commonly produced by spray-drying [121, 122] and the same technique could be applied to siRNA [122, 123] . Size of the spray-dried product must be carefully optimized for efficient delivery to the desirable site along the respiratory tract. A suitable delivery agent or formulation is required to protect the nucleic acids from degradation caused by the shear force and raised temperature during the drying process. The major drawback of DPIs is that drug deposition could be dependent on the patient inspiration flow rate. Therefore a suitable DPI device must be carefully designed to minimize such variation. In addition, the problem associated with de-aggregation of dry powders must be overcome [120] .\r\n Nebulizers are used to generate liquid aerosol and can be utilized to deliver large volumes of drug solutions or suspensions for inhalation. They are frequently used for drugs that are unsuitable to be formulated into MDIs or DPIs, and could be considered for siRNA delivery. During the process of nebulization, high shear stress is exerted on the siRNA which may lead to degradation of the nucleic acids. This is a particular problem as 99% of generated aerosol droplets are recycled back into the reservoir [41] and the shear stress could be repeatedly exerted to the nucleic acids. In addition, biomolecules tend to be less stable in liquid form then in dry powder form. Stability is the prime concern in delivering siRNA with nebulizers. A suitable delivery vector is therefore required to protect siRNA from both physical and chemical degradation.\r\n Although inhalation is a common way to deliver drug to the lungs, to our best knowledge, none of the in vivo study on siRNA therapy is intended for inhalation. Most of the in vivo studies use either intratracheal or intranasal route of delivery to the lungs. This could be due to the difficulty in formulating inhalable siRNA, especially in maintaining the stability and biological activity of siRNA during manufacturing and delivery process. Recently, Jensen et al. [123] [107] reported the production of siRNA loaded poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles by spray-drying. The integrity and biological activity of siRNA was successfully preserved during the drying process and the physicochemical properties of the particles are suitable for inhalation. It will be interesting to evaluate the in vivo performance of such formulation.\r\n Intratracheal route is commonly used for lung delivery in animal studies for all kinds of drugs. However its clinical application is very limited. The method was initially described as an exposure technique to evaluate respiratory tract toxicity from airborne materials [42] . It was later adapted to assess pulmonary drug delivery, mainly in rodents [64] . Intratracheal route is a non-physiological and extremely uncomfortable delivery technique [42] , it is therefore not employed as a routine route of drug administration for human use. Traditional method requires surgical procedure including tracheotomy, and the animal has to be anesthetized, usually with sodium pentobarbital or combination of xylazine and ketamine. The animal is then placed on a surgical board. The trachea is exposed and an endotracheal tube or needle is inserted through an incision made between the tracheal cartilaginous rings, projecting its tip at a defined position just before the tracheal bifurcation. The drug solution or suspension is instilled in the airways through the tube using a microsyringe (Fig. 3a) .\r\n A relatively non-invasive way to achieve pulmonary delivery via the intratracheal route was described by Bivas-Benita et al. [124] . No surgical procedure is required but the animal still needs to be anesthetized. While still under anesthesia, the tongue of the animal is gently pulled out and a microsprayer or similar device is carefully inserted endotracheally to deliver the aerosol into the lungs. Alternatively the animal is intubated through the mouth and trachea using a catheter or needle and the drug is being instilled in solution or suspension form. In these procedures, since the delivery is made through the mouth, it is also referred as oro-tracheal route [64] , but correct insertion to the trachea may not be straight-forward (Fig. 3b) .\r\n Many in vivo studies employed the intratracheal route to deliver siRNA to the lungs [36, 59, 61, 70, 100] . The main advantage of intratracheal delivery is that it ensures high delivery efficiency with minimal drug lost, making it an excellent delivery method for proofof-concept study when local delivery to the lung is desirable. The success of intratracheal siRNA delivery to the lungs of mouse was first reported by Perl et al. [103] . The group demonstrated that by using mice with over-expression of GFP, the intratracheal instillation of siRNA targeting GFP displayed a reduced fluorescent intensity in the lungs but not in the liver or the spleen. To investigate the gene knockdown efficiency, siRNA targeting fas and caspase-8 were delivered in the same way. The mRNA expression of fas and caspase-8 in lung tissues was found to be significantly reduced. This work also showed that the siRNAs did not induce lung inflammation as assessed by lung tissue interferon-\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels. Interestingly, delivery vector was not required to achieve in vivo siRNA transfection. Rosas-Taraco et al. [36] also reported successful delivery of naked siRNA through the intratracheal route. After the aerosolized siRNA targeting XCL1 was administered intratracheally to mouse infected with tuberculosis, the expression of XCL1 in the lungs was suppressed by 40-50% at both mRNA and protein level. Since the expression of XCL1 affects the formation of the lung granuloma which is known to be associated with mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, the local delivery of siRNA may be exploited as a novel therapy for the treatment of tuberculosis. The observation of successful in vivo gene knockdown mediated by naked siRNA is discussed later.\r\n Some studies were performed to compare siRNA mediated silencing with or without delivery vector via the intratracheal route.\r\n Moschos et al. [61] reported that naked siRNA failed to mediate any gene silencing in vitro in mouse fibroblast cell lines whereas conjugation of siRNA to cell penetrating peptides (TAT or penetratin), or lipid carrier (cholesterol) resulted in 20-40% gene silencing effect at mRNA level. Surprisingly when they proceeded to in vivo study, they found that naked siRNA managed to produce a 30-45% gene knockdown at mRNA level. Neither TAT nor penetratin improved the transfection efficiency as compared of naked siRNA. The use of cell penetrating peptides was even found to trigger inflammatory response in lung tissues. In a more recent study, Gutbier et al. [60] demonstrated that the epithelial E-cadherin was reduced moderately by 21% in mouse lung tissues following intratracheal delivery of naked target-specific siRNA, but no significant reduction of endothelial VEcadherin or lamin B1 was observed. The use of lipid-based delivery vector (DPhyPE\/DSPE-PEG) was found to evoke inflammatory response in the lungs.\r\n Despite the success of intratracheal route of siRNA delivery in animal models, it must be noted that intratracheal route is an artificial way to deliver drug into the lungs. Drug deposition by this route tends to be less uniform as compared to inhalation [64] . Since intratracheal Fig. 3 . Schematic illustrates the route of siRNA administration into the lungs used in in vivo studies. (a) Intratracheal routetrachea of the animal is exposed surgically and a tube is inserted through an incision made between the tracheal rings. The solution\/suspension is instilled through the tube using a microsyringe. (b) Oro-tracheal routethe animal is intubated from the mouth to the trachea and the solution\/suspension is instilled through the oral cavity to avoid the need of surgery. (c) Intranasal routea micropipette or catheter containing the solution\/suspension is inserted gently into the naris of the animal and the solution\/suspension is slowly instilled into the nasal cavity. route avoids the oropharynx deposition, it reduces drug loss. In addition, the effect of aerosol size which is the most critical factor affecting human lung deposition was not the focus of investigation in these studies. Therefore it is difficult to rely on this route of administration to accurately evaluate the in vivo delivery efficiency of a particular formulation.\r\n Intranasal route is another very popular way to deliver siRNA to the lungs in animal studies [31, 34, 58, 60, 99, 101, 102, [105] [106] [107] , partly because of its easy experimental setup. The animals are usually lightly to deeply anesthetized. The siRNA formulations are then instilled drop-wise to the naris to be breathed (Fig. 3c ). There were a number of studies showed success in siRNA delivery to the lung in vivo through this route. Zhang et al. [105] were the first to demonstrate that lung-specific siRNA delivery could be achieved in mouse by intranasal administration without the need for any delivery vector. Naked siRNA targeting for heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) effectively suppressed the expression of HO-1 gene in the injured lung models of mouse. Soon, the delivery of naked siRNA via intranasal route was shown to be successful in inhibiting lung viral infection in mouse [31, 102] and rhesus macaque [34] .\r\n Since the anatomy and physiology of the lungs between mouse and human are very different, the success we see in intranasal siRNA delivery to the lungs could not be easily translated to human use. Mice are obligate nasal breathers, it is not surprising to see a high proportion of siRNA delivered through the nose was deposited in the lungs. In addition, the use of anesthetics in these animal studies may have impaired the mucociliary action [125] , thereby overestimating the transfection efficiency of the formulations. In order to evaluate the feasibility of lung delivery via the nasal route in humans, Heyder et al. [126] performed an experiment on healthy adult volunteers who were asked to inhale mono-disperse particles through the nose at a fixed flow and volume. It was found that only about 3% of 1-5 \u03bcm particles were deposited in the bronchial airways through nose breathing. The majority of particles were deposited in the nose instead. For this reason, intranasal route is perfect for delivering siRNA to the nasopharynx area.\r\n In fact one of the human clinical trials, which is currently at phase II stage, uses this route to deliver siRNA for the treatment of human RSV infection [15, 16] . RSV is an upper respiratory disease. ALN-RSV01 is the siRNA, developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, designed to inhibit the replication of RSV by interrupting the synthesis of the viral nucleocapsid protein. Since RSV replicates almost exclusively in the single outermost layer of cells of the respiratory epithelium including the lining of nasal passages and trachea, local delivery of ALN-RSV01 to nasopharynx could potentially treat the infections. ALN-RSV01 is delivered without a delivery vector as a nasal spray and targets the upper respiratory tract instead of the deep lung area. The author has also pointed out that the nasal spray of ALN-RSV01 would not be expected to reach the lower respiratory tract, and the development of an aerosolized drug that targets the lower respiratory tract will be desirable in future trials for the treatment of naturally infected patients [16] .\r\n Furthermore, intranasal route is being developed for a long time to administer macromolecules such as proteins and peptides for systemic delivery [125, 127] . The relatively large absorptive surface area in the nasal cavity and the high vascularization of the nasal mucosa facilitate rapid absorption. The intranasal route is definitely a route to explore for systemic delivery of siRNA.\r\n A delivery vector is often required to facilitate the cellular delivery of siRNA as the highly charged, hydrophilic natures of the macro-molecules make it unable to cross the biological membrane to reach its target sites. Due to the safety concerns with viral-vector, many siRNA delivery studies focus on the development of non-viral vectors. An ideal siRNA delivery vector should consist of the following criteria: (i) condense siRNA into nanosized particles; (ii) protect siRNA from enzymatic degradation; (iii) facilitate cellular uptake; (iv) promote endosomal escape; (v) release siRNA into the cytoplasm where the RISC is located and (vi) negligible toxicity. In addition, optimal delivery should be achieved without compromising the gene silencing activity and specificity of siRNA. Commonly used non-viral siRNA delivery vector includes lipids, polymers and peptides. Interestingly, naked siRNA was also found to be successful in producing gene silencing effect in vivo. These vectors are illustrated in Fig. 4 and the pulmonary delivery using each of these systems is discussed in detail.\r\n The term 'naked siRNA' or 'unformulated siRNA' refers to the delivery of siRNA without using any delivery agent. This includes the delivery of both unmodified siRNA and modified siRNA, formulated in saline or other simple excipients such as 5% dextrose. Since unmodified siRNA is susceptible to nuclease degradation, chemically modified siRNA was introduced initially to address this issue by increasing the nuclease resistance. The siRNA can also be chemically modified to improve potency, increase specificity, reduce immune response and reduce off-target effects. The subject of siRNA modification has been thoroughly reviewed by Watts et al. [128] . The major consideration of siRNA modification is to ensure that the gene silencing efficiency of siRNA is not adversely affected.\r\n While the systemic delivery of naked siRNA generally failed to produce significant gene silencing effect [35, 129, 130] , surprisingly there were some successes in delivering naked, unmodified siRNA locally including to the lung [31, 34, 36, 58, 60, 102, 103, 105] (Table 1) . Some of these studies have already been discussed in section 2.3.2 and 2.3.3. Usually the naked siRNA were administrated either intranasally or intratracheally to the mouse and the siRNA were targeted against endogenous or viral genes. In some cases, the use of delivery vectors such as lipids or peptides showed no or only marginal improvement of gene silencing efficiency in the lung compared to naked siRNA [31, 61, 102] . These observations were truly intriguing, as the question of how the naked siRNA crossed the biological membrane in order to achieve the post-transcriptional gene silencing remains to be answered, although the reduced nuclease activity in the lung may provide part of the explanation [70] . Bitko et al. [102] reported that naked unmodified siRNA was able to prevent respiratory viral infection through siRNA-mediated gene knockdown when the naked siRNA was administrated intranasally in the mouse. The authors suggested that the lung tissue is perhaps more receptive to exchange of molecules naturally or when infected, and this explanation is yet to be confirmed.\r\n Nevertheless, the delivery of naked siRNA has been extended to clinical trials. As mentioned in the previous section, ALN-RSV01, which is a modified form of siRNA, were administrated intranasally as nasal spray without the use of any delivery vector and the initial data confirmed its efficiency in reducing RSV infection [15, 16] . Regardless of the mystery of how the naked siRNA can cross the cell membrane, gain access into the cytoplasm and remain intact to perform its biological action, the performance of naked siRNA so far in animal models and human studies are promising. The major advantage of using naked siRNA is simplicity without the need to concern about the toxicity and inflammatory responses associated with certain delivery vectors. However, it must be stressed that in order to make the formulation applicable for deep lung delivery in human, aerosol inhalation is still the administration route of choice. A particulate carrier will be required to deliver the siRNA in dry powder form, or a delivery agent will be needed to protect the siRNA from shear force produced during the nebulizing process in suspension form. The use of delivery agents could also enhance specific cells targeting, improve pharmacokinetics and facilitate cellular uptake [131] . There were studies indicated that the use of optimized delivery vector could significantly improve lung delivery efficiency in animal models including nonhuman primates as compared to naked siRNA [132, 133] . Therefore the development of an effective vector for pulmonary siRNA delivery is still the focus of research in the field.\r\n Lipid-based delivery systems are commonly used to deliver siRNA both in vitro and in vivo [134] . Typically cationic lipids or liposomes are used to form complexes with the negatively charged siRNA through spontaneous electrostatic interaction and the complexes are referred as lipoplexes. Many commercial siRNA transfection agents are lipids-based system, some of which are also employed for in vivo pulmonary delivery, e.g. Oligofectamine\u2122 [107] , TransIT-TKO [102] and DharmFECT [59] . The major challenges of using lipid-based delivery vectors in the clinic are their toxicity and the non-specific activation of inflammatory cytokines and interferon responses [135] . When the lipoplexes are to be aerosolized, special attention must be given to the stability [136] as they may undergo physical and chemical changes that may result in immature release and hence degradation of siRNA.\r\n In order to maximize stability and delivery efficiency, and minimize toxic side effects, it is crucial to optimize the lipid composition, lipids to siRNA ratio and the lipoplexes preparation methods. Lipoplexes are easy to prepare and generally have good transfection efficiency due to their efficient interaction with the negatively charged cell membranes. However they also present some disadvantages such as poor stability and poor reproducibility [137] . Moreover, cationic lipids or liposomes are generally more toxic than their neutral counterparts. A study performed by Dokka et al. [138] showed that pulmonary administration of cationic liposomes, Lipofectamine and DOTAP, elicited dose-response toxicity and pulmonary inflammation in mice. The effect was more pronounced with the multivalent Lipofectamine than the monovalent DOTAP. In addition, they found that neutral and anionic liposomes did not exhibit lung toxicity.\r\n To circumvent the problem associated with positive surface charge, hydrophilic polymer such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been employed to shield the surface charge of cationic lipids or liposomes, with the attempt to reduce the inflammatory response. PEG covalently linked to a phospholipid has been used for many years to prolong circulation in the bloodstream by reducing opsonization and subsequent cells capture by the mononuclear phagocyte system [139] . The cationic lipid, Genzyme Lipid (GL-67), was previously investigated for plasmid DNA delivery to the lung for the treatment cystic fibrosis in human clinical trials [140, 141] . GL-67 consisted of DOPE:DMPE-PEG 5000 (at a molar ratio of 1:2:0.05) was complexed with DNA and the resulting lipoplexes were aerosolized and administrated to the patients with a jet nebulizer. For patients who received the treatment, their chloride abnormalities were found to be significantly improved and the bacterial adherence in the lungs was reduced. The promising results have led to the investigation of the same lipid-based system for siRNA delivery. Griesenbach et al. [142] assessed the in vivo efficiency of GL-67 in delivering siRNA into the lung of mice via the intranasal route. The siRNA targeting \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) was found to be localized in alveolar macrophages. \u03b2-gal mRNA was reduced by approximately 33%, but there was no significant change in \u03b2-gal protein expression. Perhaps the use of nebulizer could be considered for further investigation of this lipidic system.\r\n Apart from PEGylation, another way to avoid toxicity and inflammatory response of lipid-based system is to use neutral lipid- based systems. Although neutral systems have the more favorable safety profile, the lack of interaction with the negatively charged siRNA has limited their use as delivery vector. There are several methods to overcome this issue. One of the strategies is to link siRNA and lipids together through direct conjugation instead of electrostatic interaction. It has been demonstrated that chemical conjugation of siRNA to cholesterol can facilitate siRNA uptake in vivo after systemic administration [143] . Moschos et al. [61] applied this strategy to pulmonary delivery of siRNA. The cholesterol-siRNA conjugates were delivered to the mice by intratracheal administration. The duration of gene knockdown effect was extended by the cholesterol-conjugated system at mRNA level as compared to naked siRNA. However the magnitude of knockdown was not improved. Importantly, the cholesterol-siRNA conjugates did not elicit inflammation in mice tissues.\r\n An alternative strategy to improve the safety profile of lipid-based system is to encapsulate the siRNA inside the neutral lipid particles. Semple et al. [144] introduced the utilization of pH sensitive ionizable aminolipids to facilitate efficient encapsulation of antisense oligonucleotide in lipid vesicles. The important characteristic of these lipids is that they exhibit positive charge at acidic pH and neutral charge at physiological pH, thereby providing means for the lipids to efficiently interact with nucleic acids and the lipid vesicles can be rendered neutral at physiological pH. Semple et al. further developed this technique to produce stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALP) of uniform size with high siRNA encapsulation and delivery efficiency [145] . The two important parameters underlying lipid design for SNALP-mediated delivery are (i) the pKa of the ionizable cationic lipid, which determines the surface charge of the lipid particles under different pH conditions; and (ii) the ability, when protonated, to induce a nonbilayer phase structure when mixed with anionic lipids. This property of the lipids determines the membrane destabilizing capacity and the endosomolytic potential of the lipid particles. The SNALP demonstrated efficient in vivo gene silencing when administered intravenously in nonhuman primates [145, 146] . These systems could be further exploited for pulmonary delivery.\r\n Recently, a new class of lipid-like delivery molecules, termed lipidoids, was developed for siRNA delivery [132, 147] . A combinatory approach was employed to allow the rapid synthesis of a large library of structurally diverse lipidoids. The library was screened for the ability to deliver siRNA in vitro and in vivo. The leading candidate for in vivo siRNA mediated gene knockdown was identified as 98N 12 -5. This system was tested for the ability to inhibit RSV replication in the lungs. After intranasal administration to the mouse model of RSV infection, the naked siRNA provided one log reduction in viral plaques in lung tissues, whereas the lipoidoid system at the same dose of siRNA provided greater than two log reductions in viral plaques [132] . This method provides the possibility of rapid design of new lipidbased materials for pulmonary siRNA delivery.\r\n One the attractive properties of polymer-based delivery vectors is their versatile nature that allows their physicochemical characteristics to be modified relatively easily to fit their purposes. In addition, it has been suggested that polymers generally do not evoke as strong an immune response as liposomes [13] . In general, polymer-based vectors can be divided into two categories: polycations and polymeric nanoparticles. Synthetic polycations such as polyethylenimine (PEI) [87] , polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers [148] and natural polycations such as chitosan [149] are used for delivering DNA for a long time. These polymers have high cationic charge density and form polyplexes spontaneously with the negatively charged nucleic acids through electrostatic interaction. The size of polyplexes is affected by the molecular weight of polymers, the charge ratio, the pH and ionic strength of the medium. A net positive charge is required to maintain colloidal stability of the polyplexes. Because of the difference in physicochemical properties between plasmid DNA and siRNA, this approach is found to be less successful in delivering siRNA [150] . The stiffer structure of siRNA results in weaker interaction with polycations [151] . As a consequence, the polyplexes are less efficient in protecting siRNA against nuclease. Increase the amount of polycations may offer better protection but it might contribute to toxicity. The alternative way to deliver siRNA using polymer is to prepare polymeric nanoparticles which are usually solid nanoparticles made from hydrophobic polymers such as poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) [122, 152] . The siRNA is either dispersed throughout the polymer matrix, or surrounded by a polymeric shell. The polymeric nanoparticles could offer better protection to siRNA, but the loading efficiency is the main challenge to this delivery method.\r\n Synthetic polymer PEI is commonly used in siRNA delivery due to its high intracellular delivery efficiency. According to the proton sponge hypothesis as mentioned earlier in Section 2.2, the high buffering capacity of PEI inside the acidic endosomes leads to the swelling and rupture of endosomes, thereby promoting endosomal escape [87] . PEI is considered as the 'gold standard' for in vitro gene delivery and its transfection efficiency depends on the molecular weight and degree of branching. Merkel et al. [70] investigated the use of PEI and PEI-PEG polyplexes for siRNA delivery to the lung. The polyplexes containing siRNA targeting EGFP were administered to the actin-EGFP expressing mice through intratracheal instillation. The result showed that the PEI-PEG system displayed a better delivery efficiency with a 42% knockdown of EFGP expression in the lung tissues. However the PEI-PEG polyplexes also produced a moderate proinflammatory effect as the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were elevated. PEI also associates with problems such as relatively high toxicity and the lack of biodegradability [86] . To tackle these problems, Xu et al. developed a new degradable PEI derivatives, poly(ester amine)-alt-PEG copolymer for in vivo siRNA delivery [57] . A previous study confirmed the biodegradability and low toxicity of this polymer [152] . For in vivo pulmonary delivery, the polyplexes containing siRNA targeting Akt1 were aerosolized and administered to mouse models of lung cancer through a nose-only inhalation system. The lung cancer progression of treated mice was significantly suppressed without showing any significant sign of toxicity. To facilitate rapid development of PEI derivatives for siRNA delivery, Thomas et al. [153] employed a high throughput synthesis and screening method to create a combinatorial library of biodegradable PEI derivatives to identify a novel vectors for gene delivery. The study focused on DNA delivery through intravenous injection to the mice and the technique could be easily adapted for the investigation of pulmonary siRNA delivery.\r\n Chitosan has attracted much attention as potential vector for siRNA delivery due to its natural, biocompatible, biodegradable and low toxicity nature. In addition, the mucoadhesive and mucosa permeation properties of chitosan make it particularly favorable for pulmonary delivery. Unfortunately, it only shows moderate in vitro and in vivo transfection efficiency, possibility due to its relatively weak ability to promote endosomal escape [86, 149] . Chitosan-based formulation for siRNA delivery has been thoroughly reviewed by Mao et al. recently [154] . The feasibility of using chitosan to deliver siRNA into the lungs was demonstrated by Howard et al. [101] . Chitosan\/siRNA nanoparticles were prepared by the addition of small volume of siRNA into chitosan stock solution in sodium acetate buffer.\r\n After the nanoparticles were administered intranasally to EGFPexpressing transgenic mice, the number of EGFP expressing epithelial cells in the bronchioles was reduced by 43% (compare to untreated control) and 37% (compared to mismatch control) [101] , and the stability of the system increased with the molecular weight and degree of deacetylation [155] . A recent study conducted by the same group described the aerosolization of chitosan\/siRNA nanoparticles for intratracheal administration with the attempt to improve lung deposition in mice [133] . The aerosol was generated by an AeroP-robe\u2122 nebulizing catheter which was inserted non-invasively into the animal below the vocal cords. This delivery route was compared with the intranasal route and, as expected, the results confirmed that the aerosolized formulation improved the lung deposition of the same siRNA dosage, and the EGFP expression in the transgenic mice model was reduced by 68%. However the author also pointed out that catheter insertion ensured sufficient delivery and the effect of size in lung deposition was not investigated. The size of aerosol droplet generated in this study was around 20 \u03bcm which is not suitable for inhalable formulation. It is critical to reduce droplet diameters in the range of 1-5 \u03bcm to allow optimal lung deposition in human following inhalation. To enhance the siRNA delivery efficiency of chitosan, Katas et al. [151] described the ionic gelation method using sodium tripolyphosphate to produce siRNA nanoparticles. Compare to electrostatic complexation, the chitosan\/siRNA nanoparticles produced by ionic gelation method showed a better in vitro gene silencing effect due to better stability and higher loading efficiency. It would be interesting to assess the in vivo performance of such system through pulmonary delivery.\r\n PLGA is a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer that is being investigated to provide controlled release of therapeutic macromolecules such as peptides, proteins and plasmid DNA [156, 157] . The versatility of PLGA allows chemical modification and many derivatives of PLGA with tailored properties are designed to fit their delivery purposes. Unlike polycations, PLGA does not form polyplexes with nucleic acids. Instead the nucleic acids are encapsulated in the PLGA nanoparticles. By manipulating the degradation rate of PLGA, sustained release of the encapsulated nucleic acids could be achieved. To design an inhalable formulation, particle size is of extreme importance. Double emulsion-solvent evaporation is conventionally used to prepare PLGA nanoparticles and the dry particles are then collected by lyophilization [157] . However large specific surface area of the particles often leads to aggregation and the ice formation during lyophilization process also facilitates aggregation. As a result particles prepared by this method are not desirable for inhalable formulation as large particle size is likely to be impacted out in the oropharynx area. Takashima et al. [158] demonstrated that aggregation of PLGA particles containing plasmid DNA could be effectively minimized without loss of in vitro transfection efficiency using spray-drying technique. This method was soon adapted by Jensen et al. [123] who demonstrated the production siRNA containing PLGA nanoparticles by spray-drying with controlled size distribution that are intended for inhalation. PLGA nanoparticles were co-spray-dried with a carbohydrate excipient such as lactose, trehalose and mannitol to protect the siRNA containing nanoparticles against the shear forces and raised temperature during the process of spray-drying, and to ensure the particle size is suitable for inhalation. The physicochemical properties and the powder yield of the formulation could be optimized by varying the amount of excipients and the nanoparticles to excipients ratios. The study showed that the integrity and biological activity of the siRNA were preserved during the spray-drying process. The potential of this technique to generate inhalable siRNA formulation will be confirmed by further investigation on lung deposition and in vivo gene silencing efficiency.\r\n Since the discovery of TAT protein from HIV-1 which is responsible for the cellular uptake of the virus [159] , a variety of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been derived or synthesized. CPPs are frequently employed to facilitate the transport of therapeutic macromolecules into the cells and this strategy has been extended to the delivery of siRNA [160, 161] . CPPs and derivatives that are investigated for siRNA delivery included TAT [61, 162, 163] , penetratin [163] [164] [165] , transportan [163] , MPG [166, 167] , CADY [168, 169] and LAH4 [170] . The peptides are either covalently attached to siRNA through disulphide bond formation, or bind to siRNA through electrostatic interaction to form complexes in a non-covalent manner. Due to the sequence diversity of different CPPs, their mechanism of action is also expected to vary. Some of these peptides improve cellular delivery by efficient transport of their cargo across the biological membranes, whereas others promote endosomal escape and prevent lysosomal degradation. However the exact mechanisms of these peptides are still controversial. The activities of different CPPs have been extensively reviewed [161, 167, [171] [172] [173] [174] .\r\n Although a variety of CPPs have been investigated for siRNA delivery, very few studies reported their use for in vivo pulmonary delivery. To date only one group has described the use of CPPs for in vivo delivery of siRNA. Using siRNA targeting p38 MAP kinase, Moschos et al. [61, 175] compared the gene silencing effect between naked siRNA, TAT-siRNA conjugates and penetratin-siRNA conjugates both in vitro and in vivo. The peptides were conjugated to the siRNA through disulfide linkage. All siRNA conjugates, but not naked siRNA, showed small but significant reduction (20-36%) of p38 MAP kinase expression at mRNA level in mouse fibroblast L929 cell lines. Interestingly, when the systems were administrated intratracheally to mouse model, naked siRNA was able to produce a 30-45% knockdown of p38 MAP kinase in the lung of the animal despite the absence of knockdown effect in vitro. Although moderate gene knockdown was observed in TAT-and penetratin-siRNA conjugated systems, the TAT or penetratin peptide alone also produced similar knockdown level, suggesting that the CPPs could be the modulators of p38 MAP kinase expression and the gene knockdown effect was not produced by the siRNA. Furthermore, penetratin-siRNA conjugates were found to induce an in vivo innate immune response, but not with the naked siRNA, TAT-siRNA conjugates, penetratin or TAT alone. The understanding of the mechanism of CPPs activity was crucial to determine their application in siRNA delivery. In addition, it has been suggested that covalent attachment of CPP to siRNA may have a negative effect on cellular delivery as the biological activity of the peptides may have been altered during chemical modification [161] . The non-covalent complexing method provides an alternative strategy but the effect in lung delivery to animal model remains to be seen. More work needs to be done in this area to develop an effective peptide-based siRNA vector system for in vivo pulmonary delivery.\r\n Since the discovery of siRNA, its therapeutic potential has been rapidly recognized. Many studies have been carried out in the past few years in delivering siRNA to the lungs for the treatment of various lung diseases. However the majority of these investigations focus on the design of siRNA molecules to target a specific disease instead of looking into the delivery perspective. In order to make siRNA therapy practical in treating human lung diseases, we believe that the inhalation route, especially in dry powder form, is the best of choice. Unfortunately there is very few literature described siRNA formulation specifically designed for inhalation for clinical use. Very recently, Jensen et al. [123] reported the spray-drying method to produce PLGA based siRNA nanoparticles with physiochemical properties that are intended for inhalation, but they have not reached the stage of in vivo study yet.\r\n The major challenges to pulmonary delivery of siRNA include: (i) there is no obvious correlation between in vitro and in vivo study (e.g. the naked siRNA failed to show gene silencing effect in vitro in many studies, but the in vivo studies often proved otherwise); (ii) it is very hard to translate the information from animal (especially rodents which are the most frequently used model) to human as the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory tract between animal and human are very distinct; and (iii) the administration routes used for animal studies are not suitable for human use, and it is extremely difficult to evaluate the delivery efficiency of the formulation before it enters the clinical study. Since many studies have successfully proved the therapeutic efficiency of siRNA on various lung diseases, the final hurdle we need to overcome is the development of inhalable and stable siRNA formulations for human use in a practical way before siRNA therapeutics for lung diseases become available in the clinic.","sha":"0b4f6501ac34ce2350bcdb121130247e2523d928","publish_time":"2012-01-31","authors":"Lam, Jenny Ka-Wing; Liang, Wanling; Chan, Hak-Kim","journal":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","doi":"10.1016\/j.addr.2011.02.006","Title":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","H index":278.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"RNA interference (RNAi) has huge therapeutic potential in treating many diseases by silencing the expression of the target gene in a posttranscriptional manner. In brief, RNAi can be achieved artificially by three major ways: (i) introducing long double stranded RNA (dsRNA) which is cleaved into small interfering RNA (siRNA) by the enzyme Dicer in the cytoplasm, leading to the degradation of target mRNA; (ii) introducing plasmid DNA encodes for short hairpin RNA (shRNA) which is processed by Dicer into siRNA; and (iii) introducing small interfering RNA (siRNA) directly to initiate the mRNA degradation process. In order for DNA to be properly expressed, it must enter the nucleus where transcription takes place. Although shRNA has a higher gene silencing potency than siRNA [9, 10] , the relatively ease of delivery makes siRNA a better candidate for RNAi therapy. Since then a number of clinical trials of siRNA therapy are being conducted for different conditions [13] , including solid tumor cancers [14] and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection [15, 16] . RNAi can be potentially used to treat or prevent diseases affecting the airways, such as lung cancer [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , various types of respiratory infectious diseases [16, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , airway inflammatory diseases [37] [38] [39] and cystic fibrosis [40] . siRNA delivery to the lungs could be achieved either by local delivery or systemic delivery. All these factors allow efficient and rapid siRNA absorption. There are several ways to administer siRNA locally into the lungs. siRNA for inhalation can be formulated into liquid aerosol or dry powder aerosol. It is generally considered to be used in animal studies only rather than for clinical applications. It limits the effectiveness of therapy in repeated administration. The viral vectors are excellent agents to deliver siRNA for proof-of-concept studies, but appear to lack of real clinical application because of the safety issues. Commonly used non-viral vectors for siRNA delivery include lipids, polymers and peptides. The respiratory tract can be divided into two regions: (i) the conducting region which consists of nasal cavity, pharynx, trachea, bronchi and bronchioles; and (ii) the respiratory region which consists of the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli. The most prominent feature of the respiratory tract is the high degree of branching. Many lung diseases affect the lower region of the lungs. Large particles (N6 \u03bcm aerodynamic diameter) carry high momentum and are more likely to be impacted on the airway wall at bifurcations instead of following the changing airstream. Therefore they are usually deposited higher up in the airway such as the back of the throat or pharynx. However, these ultrafine particles usually enter the lungs as larger agglomerates which can be broken down relatively easily into smaller particles on deposition. Very little is known about exactly how siRNA is cleared from the lungs. Major barriers to pulmonary delivery include the mucociliary clearance action of the ciliated epithelial cells, and the presence of mucus, alveolar fluid and macrophages along different parts of the airways [67, 68] . Particles that are deposited on the ciliated cells are rapidly removed by mucociliary clearance and are eventually being coughed up or swallowed. The alveolar fluid is found on the surface of alveoli epithelium as a thin layer of pulmonary surfactant which comprises phospholipids and other surfactant proteins. At disease state, the physiological conditions of the airways might be altered and pose a huge impact on the efficiency of the pulmonary delivery system. However their clinical benefits are limited [67, 78] . siRNA is a negatively charged hydrophilic macromolecules with a molecular weight around 13 kDa. Particles that are taken up by the cells through this pathway are enclosed in clathrin-coated vesicles. Polymers such as polyethylenimine (PEI) have the ability to trigger endosomal release. This leads to the influx of chloride ions, protons and subsequently water into the endosomes. However the cellular effect of 'endosomes bursting' has not been properly discussed or evaluated and the PEI is also known to be associated with toxicity problem. After internalization, the delivery systems are enclosed in caveolin-coated vesicles called caveosomes which are non-acidic. Since caveolin is abundantly expressed in many cell types including lung tissues [92, 93] , it is an important route of cell internalization in pulmonary delivery, and perhaps a more efficient route compared to clathrin-mediated endocytosis, especially with the delivery system that lacks the ability to escape from the acidic endosomal compartments. There is no exception to therapeutic siRNA. The summary of the in vivo studies of non-viral siRNA delivery to the lung is provided in Table 2 , and the routes of administration commonly used in these studies are illustrated in Fig. Intratracheal route is an invasive method of delivery which is not appropriate for human use. They are pressurized dosage form in which the therapeutic agents are either dissolved or suspended in propellants such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs). However both CFCs and HFAs are known to have environmental impact. It may not be the best direction for developing inhalable siRNA. DPIs are aerosol systems in which drugs are inhaled as clouds of dry particles. Similar issues will be encountered for siRNA. Nevertheless, possible ways to tackle these challenges have been addressed [112] . This encourages further development of dry powder form of macromolecules for inhalation. Therefore a suitable DPI device must be carefully designed to minimize such variation. Nebulizers are used to generate liquid aerosol and can be utilized to deliver large volumes of drug solutions or suspensions for inhalation. During the process of nebulization, high shear stress is exerted on the siRNA which may lead to degradation of the nucleic acids. This is a particular problem as 99% of generated aerosol droplets are recycled back into the reservoir [41] and the shear stress could be repeatedly exerted to the nucleic acids. Stability is the prime concern in delivering siRNA with nebulizers. Intratracheal route is commonly used for lung delivery in animal studies for all kinds of drugs. However its clinical application is very limited. The animal is then placed on a surgical board. The drug solution or suspension is instilled in the airways through the tube using a microsyringe (Fig. Alternatively the animal is intubated through the mouth and trachea using a catheter or needle and the drug is being instilled in solution or suspension form. The mRNA expression of fas and caspase-8 in lung tissues was found to be significantly reduced. This work also showed that the siRNAs did not induce lung inflammation as assessed by lung tissue interferon-\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels. 61] reported that naked siRNA failed to mediate any gene silencing in vitro in mouse fibroblast cell lines whereas conjugation of siRNA to cell penetrating peptides (TAT or penetratin), or lipid carrier (cholesterol) resulted in 20-40% gene silencing effect at mRNA level. Despite the success of intratracheal route of siRNA delivery in animal models, it must be noted that intratracheal route is an artificial way to deliver drug into the lungs. b) Oro-tracheal routethe animal is intubated from the mouth to the trachea and the solution\/suspension is instilled through the oral cavity to avoid the need of surgery. ( In addition, the effect of aerosol size which is the most critical factor affecting human lung deposition was not the focus of investigation in these studies. Intranasal route is another very popular way to deliver siRNA to the lungs in animal studies [31, 34, 58, 60, 99, 101, 102, [105] [106] [107] , partly because of its easy experimental setup. The animals are usually lightly to deeply anesthetized. Naked siRNA targeting for heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) effectively suppressed the expression of HO-1 gene in the injured lung models of mouse. Soon, the delivery of naked siRNA via intranasal route was shown to be successful in inhibiting lung viral infection in mouse [31, 102] and rhesus macaque [34] . The author has also pointed out that the nasal spray of ALN-RSV01 would not be expected to reach the lower respiratory tract, and the development of an aerosolized drug that targets the lower respiratory tract will be desirable in future trials for the treatment of naturally infected patients [16] . Furthermore, intranasal route is being developed for a long time to administer macromolecules such as proteins and peptides for systemic delivery [125, 127] . A delivery vector is often required to facilitate the cellular delivery of siRNA as the highly charged, hydrophilic natures of the macro-molecules make it unable to cross the biological membrane to reach its target sites. Due to the safety concerns with viral-vector, many siRNA delivery studies focus on the development of non-viral vectors. 4 and the pulmonary delivery using each of these systems is discussed in detail. This includes the delivery of both unmodified siRNA and modified siRNA, formulated in saline or other simple excipients such as 5% dextrose. Some of these studies have already been discussed in section 2.3.2 and 2.3.3. These observations were truly intriguing, as the question of how the naked siRNA crossed the biological membrane in order to achieve the post-transcriptional gene silencing remains to be answered, although the reduced nuclease activity in the lung may provide part of the explanation [70] . 102] reported that naked unmodified siRNA was able to prevent respiratory viral infection through siRNA-mediated gene knockdown when the naked siRNA was administrated intranasally in the mouse. However, it must be stressed that in order to make the formulation applicable for deep lung delivery in human, aerosol inhalation is still the administration route of choice. Lipid-based delivery systems are commonly used to deliver siRNA both in vitro and in vivo [134] . In order to maximize stability and delivery efficiency, and minimize toxic side effects, it is crucial to optimize the lipid composition, lipids to siRNA ratio and the lipoplexes preparation methods. The effect was more pronounced with the multivalent Lipofectamine than the monovalent DOTAP. The promising results have led to the investigation of the same lipid-based system for siRNA delivery. There are several methods to overcome this issue. However the magnitude of knockdown was not improved. Importantly, the cholesterol-siRNA conjugates did not elicit inflammation in mice tissues. This system was tested for the ability to inhibit RSV replication in the lungs. One the attractive properties of polymer-based delivery vectors is their versatile nature that allows their physicochemical characteristics to be modified relatively easily to fit their purposes. In addition, it has been suggested that polymers generally do not evoke as strong an immune response as liposomes [13] . These polymers have high cationic charge density and form polyplexes spontaneously with the negatively charged nucleic acids through electrostatic interaction. As a consequence, the polyplexes are less efficient in protecting siRNA against nuclease. The alternative way to deliver siRNA using polymer is to prepare polymeric nanoparticles which are usually solid nanoparticles made from hydrophobic polymers such as poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) [122, 152] . The polymeric nanoparticles could offer better protection to siRNA, but the loading efficiency is the main challenge to this delivery method. Synthetic polymer PEI is commonly used in siRNA delivery due to its high intracellular delivery efficiency. 70] investigated the use of PEI and PEI-PEG polyplexes for siRNA delivery to the lung. PEI also associates with problems such as relatively high toxicity and the lack of biodegradability [86] . 153] employed a high throughput synthesis and screening method to create a combinatorial library of biodegradable PEI derivatives to identify a novel vectors for gene delivery. The study focused on DNA delivery through intravenous injection to the mice and the technique could be easily adapted for the investigation of pulmonary siRNA delivery. Chitosan has attracted much attention as potential vector for siRNA delivery due to its natural, biocompatible, biodegradable and low toxicity nature. After the nanoparticles were administered intranasally to EGFPexpressing transgenic mice, the number of EGFP expressing epithelial cells in the bronchioles was reduced by 43% (compare to untreated control) and 37% (compared to mismatch control) [101] , and the stability of the system increased with the molecular weight and degree of deacetylation [155] . A recent study conducted by the same group described the aerosolization of chitosan\/siRNA nanoparticles for intratracheal administration with the attempt to improve lung deposition in mice [133] . It is critical to reduce droplet diameters in the range of 1-5 \u03bcm to allow optimal lung deposition in human following inhalation. To enhance the siRNA delivery efficiency of chitosan, Katas et al. [ It would be interesting to assess the in vivo performance of such system through pulmonary delivery. Instead the nucleic acids are encapsulated in the PLGA nanoparticles. This method was soon adapted by Jensen et al. [ The study showed that the integrity and biological activity of the siRNA were preserved during the spray-drying process. However the exact mechanisms of these peptides are still controversial. To date only one group has described the use of CPPs for in vivo delivery of siRNA. Many studies have been carried out in the past few years in delivering siRNA to the lungs for the treatment of various lung diseases. Unfortunately there is very few literature described siRNA formulation specifically designed for inhalation for clinical use. 123] reported the spray-drying method to produce PLGA based siRNA nanoparticles with physiochemical properties that are intended for inhalation, but they have not reached the stage of in vivo study yet."},{"Unnamed: 0":20,"Unnamed: 0.1":20,"doc_id":"d745b87efec393437fab144f59c78f5a369db42c","title":"Genomic Analysis Reveals Age-Dependent Innate Immune Responses to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus \u1c14 \u2020","abstract":"The relationship between immunosenescence and the host response to virus infection is poorly understood at the molecular level. Two different patterns of pulmonary host responses to virus were observed when gene expression profiles from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-infected young mice that show minimal disease were compared to those from SARS-CoV-infected aged mice that develop pneumonitis. In young mice, genes related to cellular development, cell growth, and cell cycle were downregulated during peak viral replication, and these transcripts returned to basal levels as virus was cleared. In contrast, aged mice had a greater number of upregulated immune response and cell-to-cell signaling genes, and the expression of many genes was sustained even after viral clearance, suggesting an exacerbated host response to virus. Interestingly, in SARS-CoV-infected aged mice, a subset of genes, including Tnfa, Il6, Ccl2, Ccl3, Cxcl10, and Ifng, was induced in a biphasic pattern that correlated with peak viral replication and a subsequent influx of lymphocytes and severe histopathologic changes in the lungs. We provide insight into gene expression profiles and molecular signatures underlying immunosenescence in the context of the host response to viral infection.","text_body":"The fastest-growing group in the U.S. population comprises individuals over the age of 65 years (42) , with the maximum life span of an individual currently estimated at 120 years (7) . While the elderly population steadily increases, this group also experiences enhanced severity of bacterial and viral infections, including pneumococcal, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus infections. Influenza virus alone causes significant morbidity in persons \u054665 years of age, accounting for ca. 90% of the estimated 36,000 deaths yearly (38) . More recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in the human population, disproportionately affecting the elderly, with up to 50% of all deaths occurring in persons \u03fe65 years of age (10) . The immune response of the aging host could play a role in the enhanced susceptibility of the elderly to development of severe respiratory tract disease after infection with these pathogens. This aging or \"remodeling\" of the immune response is designated \"immunosenescence\" and is found in both long-and short-lived species as a function of their age relative to life expectancy rather than as chronologic time. For example, although the immune system of a 12month-old child is literally in its infancy and becomes more competent with each passing day, the immune system of a 12-month-old mouse shows signs of immunosenescence and could be used to investigate an aged, yet naive, host response to a new pathogen.\r\n Mice have been used to investigate SARS-CoV infection (12, 35, 41) . The virus replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tract of young mice and is cleared rapidly with transient mild pneumonitis (29) . Although an adaptive immune response that can protect from reinfection occurs in mice, the innate immune response appears to be sufficient for viral clearance. Selected strains of mice with targeted genetic defects have been used to probe pathways in the innate and adaptive immune response during SARS-CoV infection. CD1 \u03ea\/\u03ea mice and Rag1 \u03ea\/\u03ea mice (12) cleared the virus like wild-type mice, indicating that young mice do not require adaptive immunity or natural killer (NK) cell function for viral clearance. Stat1 \u03ea\/\u03ea mice (14) showed high levels of viral replication in the lungs, severe pulmonary disease with inflammation of small airways and alveoli, and systemic spread to the liver and spleen, indicating the importance of the effects of interferon, and the innate immune response. Based on the heightened susceptibility of elderly humans to severe SARS, it was hypothesized that aged mice might be more susceptible to disease than young mice. The study demonstrated that SARS-CoV replication in 12-month-old BALB\/c mice was associated with clinical illness and pneumonia, demonstrating an age-related susceptibility to SARS disease in mice that parallels the human experience (30) .\r\n In the present study, we investigated the response to SARS-CoV infection by comparing gene expression profiles in pulmonary samples from young and old SARS-CoV-infected mice. Young mice cleared the virus, showed mild lung pathology, and demonstrated a limited number of differentially expressed genes. Older mice demonstrated delayed clearance of virus and developed histopathological lesions similar to those observed in human cases of SARS (11, 21, 26, 27, 39) . The aged mice also demonstrated many strongly differentially expressed genes that remained throughout the infection and may be indicative of an exacerbated host response to the virus. The present study represents an endeavor to define molecular signatures underlying senescence and the effects of the remodeling of the immune system, driven by aging, by the course of viral infection, viral clearance, and pathology associated with viral infection.\r\n Animal studies. Animal experiments were previously conducted for initial characterization studies in aged and young BALB\/c mice. Briefly, 10 5 50% tissue culture infective doses of SARS-CoV (Urbani isolate) were administered intranasally to either 8-week-old (young) or 12-to 14-month-old (aged) BALB\/c mice as previously described (12, 30, 41) . Four mice in each age group were euthanized on days 1, 2, 5, and 7 postinfection. Five mock-infected mice in each age group were inoculated with phosphate-buffered saline and euthanized on day 7, serving as a negative control group. At necropsy, lungs were removed and stored at \u03ea70\u00b0C until the end of the study.\r\n RNA isolation and genomic precharacterization. One lung from each mouse was transferred to Solution D (6) to be homogenized, and RNA was extracted and purified according to our standard protocol (17) . One aged mock-infected reference and one young mock-infected reference were created by pooling equal mass quantities of total RNA extracted from five aged and five young mockinfected mice, respectively. Equal mass quantities of total RNA extracted from four virus-infected mice at each time point were pooled to generate four virusinfected samples (days 1, 2, 5, and 7) for each age group (i.e., each virus-infected sample was composed of lungs from four individual mice). To assure that pooling was an appropriate strategy for generating experimental samples for microarray analysis, individual infected aged BALB\/c mouse samples obtained at day 2 were checked for similarity of viral and cellular transcripts by using a panel of TaqMan primer\/probes (e.g., Irf1, Irf7, Ifnb1, Ccl4, Stat1, Gapdh, SARS-CoV M, and SARS-CoV NP). This \"proof of concept\" characterization showed that samples from these inbred infected BALB\/c mice were similar in viral and cellular transcripts (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), so each four-mouse set was pooled to create an experimental microarray sample. To confirm that the extracted total RNA was pure and intact, the pooled samples were checked by using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA); all samples were judged pristine.\r\n Oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Each pooled sample was used to produce a cRNA probe using an Agilent low RNA input fluorescent linear amplification kit. Each experimental sample from the pooled infected aged or the pooled infected young mice was then cohybridized with a reference sample from the pooled mock-infected young mice, designated \"young\" so that these agedyoung SARS-CoV-infected mouse samples could be directly compared to data from earlier experiments in our historical microarray database that includes data from experiments that were performed in young BALB\/c mice. In addition, one microarray experiment was performed comparing the pooled young mock-infected reference to the pooled mock-infected aged reference so that differences in basal levels that might indicate immunosenescence could be determined. This young-aged mock reference comparison would also allow us to re-ratio (31) the microarray experiments to obtain an in silico version of each experimental aged mice versus a mock-infected aged reference. The experimental design is shown in Fig. S2 in the supplemental material. All microarray slide hybridization was performed with mouse oligonucleotide arrays (G4121B; Agilent Technologies). Slides were scanned with an Agilent DNA microarray scanner, and image analysis was performed by using Agilent feature extractor software. Each microarray experiment was done with four technical replicates by reversing dye hybridization for experimental and reference samples (19) .\r\n All data were entered into a custom-designed database, Expression Array Manager, and then uploaded into Resolver 4.0 (Rosetta Biosoftware, Seattle, WA) for gene expression analysis. For functional gene expression mining, DecisionSite for Functional Genomics (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA), and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) were used to generate heat maps and group genes according to biological processes and canonical pathways. Finally, biological gene sets (referred to as biosets) were compiled for key cellular processes by selecting genes of interest that were represented on the microarray and also had Gene Ontology (GO) annotation (13) . In accordance with proposed standards (1), all of the data described here, including sample information, intensity measurements, gene lists, error analysis, microarray content, and slide hybridization conditions, are available in the public domain through Expression Array Manager at http:\/\/expression .viromics.washington.edu.\r\n Quantitative and absolute quantification real-time RT-PCR. Relative quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV in lung tissue samples from infected mice and to validate a number of gene expression changes of cellular genes (e.g., Cdc2a, Pcna, Top2a, Cxcl10, Ddx58, Irf7, Isgf3g, Stat1, Stat2, and TNF) as detected on the microarrays. Total RNA samples were treated with DNase using a DNA-free DNase kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). cDNA was generated by using reverse transcription reagents and random hexamers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). qRT-PCR was run on the ABI 7500 PCR system, using TaqMan chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers and probe specific for the nucleoprotein gene of SARS-CoV have been described earlier (22) , and primers and probes specific for murine cellular genes were purchased from Applied Biosystems as \"gene expression assays.\" Targets were run in quadruplicate following protocols supplied by Applied Biosystems. Absolute qRT-PCR was used to obtain viral copy numbers per nanogram of total RNA. These data were generated by using absolute qRT-PCR techniques, combined with the creation of a standard curve using known quantities of SARS armored RNA (developed jointly by Ambion, Inc., and Cenetron Diagnostics, LLC [catalog no. 42091]). SARS armored RNA can be used as a viral mRNA positive control and is stable upon storage because the control has a defined viral SARS-CoV sequence that is packaged in bacteriophage coat proteins to protect and stabilize the RNA. Armored RNA controls are highly uniform, precisely calibrated, and entirely noninfectious.\r\n BD cytometric bead array and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Supernatants of 10% (wt\/vol) lung homogenates (J. Chen et al., unpublished data) were used for detection of cytokine and chemokine protein expression using BD CBA mouse inflammation and Th1\/Th2 kits (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and murine Quantikine immunoassay kits (R&D, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The data are expressed as nanograms of protein per gram of tissue.\r\n Previous studies have demonstrated that young BALB\/c mice infected with SARS-CoV showed pulmonary viral replication with no clinical illness (35, 41) , while aged BALB\/c mice infected with SARS-CoV showed pulmonary viral replication associated with clinical illness and significant pathological changes in the lungs (30) . Clinical illness was characterized by significant weight loss, hunching, ruffled fur, and slight dehydration. Pulmonary pathology was characterized by pneumonitis, alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, edema, and persistence of fibrotic foci. We compared aged and young mice infected with SARS-CoV (Urbani) and detected high titers of virus at days 1 and 2 in young mice and at days 2 and 5 in old mice (Fig. 1A) , with titers in aged mice being 10-fold higher than in young mice on day 2. We next investigated differential host cellular gene transcripts in response to virus infection. First, we examined each gene expression experiment separately to see whether a general host response to virus infection could be identified; genes were included if they showed an absolute fold change of \u05462 and a P value of \u05450.01. With the exception of day 1 postinfection, young SARS-CoV-infected mice had fewer differentially expressed genes than older mice, but the number of genes stayed the same over the course of the infection in young mice (Fig. 1B) . In contrast, from day 2 postinfection onward, along with viral replication, the number of differentially expressed genes in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected aged mice approximately tripled, demonstrating a more robust host response in aged mice. In order to examine how timing after virus administration influenced gene expression, global expression profiling was performed. Hierarchical clustering methods were used to order rows (genes) and columns (samples) and identify groups of genes or samples with similar expression patterns ( Fig. 1C) (5, 32) . These analyses yielded 541 gene sequences for the young SARS-CoV-infected mice and 1,735 gene sequences for the aged SARS-CoV-infected mice. These cluster diagrams suggest that aged mice show a more zealous response to virus infection, as indicated by the greater number of matrix entries (genes), as well as the brighter intensities of the matrix entries (fold changes in transcripts) included in the heat map for aged mice. The results did not cluster by time from virus administration or by number of differentially expressed cellular genes, as indicated by the dendrogram at the top of each heat map. Dendrograms (trees) of the heat map represent the degree of relatedness between the samples, with short branches denoting a high degree of similarity and long branches denoting a low degree of similarity. In addition, the predominant pattern of gene expression in aged mice was of upregulated genes, which is suggestive of an active host response to viral infection, while the predominant pattern in young mice was of downregulated genes, a finding suggestive of a reduction of transcription.\r\n Prominent host gene expression profiles. Because more than 1,000 genes were differentially expressed in SARS-CoVinfected aged mice, we stratified the results into early, intermediate, and late phases over the course of infection to dissect and more fully understand expression profiles of host cellular genes. Early genes were defined as showing an absolute fold change of \u05462 and a P value of \u05450.01 on both days 1 and 2 postinfection. Intermediate genes were defined by the same criteria on both days 2 and 5 postinfection. Late genes were defined by the same criteria on both days 5 and 7 postinfection. The terms \"early,\" \"intermediate,\" and \"late\" are not based on physiologic criteria; they only refer to gene expression within the context of the time points included in our experiments. The requirement that each gene be regulated at more than one time point increases the likelihood that the genes are consis- (30) . Plus signs indicate the presence of a finding, and minus signs indicate the absence of a finding. na, not applicable; nd, not done. The mean virus titer is expressed as the log 10 50% tissue culture infective dose per gram of tissue. In aged mice, day 1 titers are typically 1-log lower than day 2 titers and day 7 titers are near or below the limit of detection. (B) The number of cellular genes differentially expressed in lung tissues is the result of comparing gene expression in lungs of experimentally infected mice (pooled, n \u03ed 4) with gene expression in lungs of mock-infected mice (pooled, n \u03ed 5); genes were included (y axis) if they met the criteria of an absolute fold change of \u05462 and P \u0545 0.01 for young (open) and old (gray) SARS-CoV-infected mice on the indicated days (x axis). (C) Global gene expression profiles are the results of comparing gene expression in lungs of experimentally infected mice (pooled, n \u03ed 4) with gene expression in lungs of mock-infected mice (pooled, n \u03ed 5); genes were included if they met the criteria of an absolute fold change of \u05462 and P \u0545 0.01 in at least one experiment. The data are presented for young (Y) and aged (A) mice on indicated days (D) 1, 2, 5, and 7 postinfection. These data were plotted as a heat map, where each matrix entry represents a gene expression value. Red corresponds to higher gene expression than that of the reference; green corresponds to lower gene expression. Dendrograms (trees) of the heat map represent the degree of relatedness between the samples, with short branches denoting a high degree of similarity and long branches denoting a low degree of similarity. Heat maps from young (541 sequences) and aged (1,735 sequences) mice were created individually because each set was compared to its age-matched mock-infected reference. tently affected in the course of SARS-CoV infection, and therefore these sets of genes will constitute a smaller subset of the global gene expression present in Fig. 1C . Using this strategy, 196 total genes were differentially expressed in young SARS-CoV-infected mice (Fig. 2) , while 237 total genes were differentially expressed in aged SARS-CoV-infected mice (Fig.  3) . We generated Venn diagrams to determine the extent of overlap (i.e., similar response) at early, intermediate, and late time points (heat maps of all Venn diagram permutations are supplied (see Fig. S3 and S4 in the supplemental material).\r\n Notably, in young SARS-CoV-infected mice, the greatest number of genes was differentially expressed (gray area in the Venn diagram) at early time points (52 genes) or throughout the course of the infection (early\/intermediate\/late, 55 genes) (Fig. 2) . Surprisingly, a majority of these genes were downregulated, and their function corresponded to cellular development, cell growth, and cell cycle. In contrast, in aged SARS-CoV-infected mice the greatest number of genes was differentially expressed (gray area in the Venn diagram) at late (71 genes), late\/intermediate (80 genes), and throughout the course of infection (early\/intermediate\/late, 42 genes) (Fig. 3) . Two trends were observed. One set of genes that comprised cell cycle, DNA repair, and cell death functions was inversely correlated in the two groups of mice, with downregulation prevalent in young mice and upregulation in aged mice. The second trend was seen with genes that were upregulated in both sets of mice. In the aged mice, these genes were upregulated at day 1, became more strongly upregulated on day 2 corresponding to peak viral replication, and were expressed at high levels to day 7. In contrast, the young mice showed very little upregulation on day 1 but had a prominent response on day 2, also corresponding to peak viral replication, followed by a regression toward basal levels. This set comprised strong immune response and cell-to-cell signaling functions. In addition, the 196 genes differentially expressed in the young SARS-CoV-infected mice (Fig. 2 ) and the 237 genes differentially expressed in the aged SARS-CoV-infected mice (Fig. 3) were manipulated to find the overlap between the two groups. These groups had 71 genes in common (Fig. 4) , again showing a strong presence of genes involved in cell cycle and immune response.\r\n We also wanted to highlight the differentially expressed genes within the context of the immune response of aged mice. Protein levels of Tnfa (534.00, 92.00, and 659.00 ng\/g), Il6, Functional annotation was generated by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis as described in the text. The percentage was calculated by using the total number of genes in each functionality group and the total number of genes that could be functionally annotated. Heat maps of all of the areas in the Venn diagram are given in Fig. S3 (Chen et al., unpublished) . mRNA levels of these genes, as well as Ifng, showed a biphasic pattern (Fig. 5A) . To identify other genes regulated in this manner, we evaluated the 196 genes of young SARS-CoV-infected mice (Fig. 2) and 237 genes of aged SARS-CoV-infected mice (Fig.  3) for genes that showed a fold change of \u05462 at day 2, a decrease in fold change at day 5, and a fold change day 7 \/fold change day 5 ratio of \u05462. Interestingly, 33 genes were identified in aged SARS-CoV-infected mice (Fig. 5B ) that showed this biphasic pattern. These criteria were not met by gene expression in young mice. The first phase of the biphasic response correlates well with peak virus titer and migration and activation of NK cells, macrophages, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells Because the same innate immune response genes are operative in young and aged SARS-CoV-infected mice, we sought to understand these responses in the context of senescence. We directly compared lung samples from mock-infected aged mice to lung samples from mock-infected young mice in order to identify basal gene expression and to put the host response to viral infection within the context of aging (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). Immunoglobulin-related genes showed a general trend of upregulation in aged mice, and genes involved in immunoglobulin recombination were suppressed. These trends might reflect a more mature host immune system that has encountered several antigens. Genes involved in T-cell receptor signaling were also suppressed in the aged mice. This observation parallels what was reported previously using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from aged mice and aged humans (16) . The suppression of these genes may represent a more limited population of naive T cells found in aged mice. In addition, a number of cell cycle and cyclin transcripts that may be markers of a general cellular senescence were downregulated. Future studies in aging mice will be important to further define this cellular senescence that is postulated to be a unique state of arrest that is distinct from apoptosis or necrosis (20) .\r\n Detected networks and gene interactions. In order to assess the interplay between genes during the host response to virus infection, we used a functional analysis approach to construct 6. (A) At the time of peak viral replication, aged and young mice present different \"top\" networks. A network is a group of biologically related genes that is derived from known relationships present in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. These diagrams, which comprise the two top networks, represent the interactions, both direct (solid lines) and indirect (dashed lines), between genes and gene products identified during peak viral replication. Network 1 was the most prominent network detected at day 2 in young SARS-CoV-infected mice and was composed of cell cycle, cellular development, and hematological system development functions. Network 2 was the most prominent network detected at day 2 in aged SARS-CoV-infected mice and was composed of immune response, inflammatory response, and cell-to-cell signaling functions. Young mice show network 1 to be downregulated, and although aged mice show a very strong induction of network 2, young mice also induce this network. Dark red indicates a fold change of \u05465, pink indicates a fold change of \u05462, and gray indicates a fold change of \u03fd2. Dark green indicates a fold change of \u05465, light green indicates a fold change of \u05462, and gray indicates an absolute fold change of \u03fd2. Gene expression profiles are the result of comparing gene expression in the lungs of experimentally infected mice (pooled, n \u03ed 4) with gene expression in the lungs of mock-infected mice (pooled, n \u03ed 5). (B) Network interactions at day 7 postinfection when SARS-CoV is cleared from the lungs. This is the same merged network shown in Fig. 6A . Again, young mice showed a prominent downregulation at day 7 but also seem to show a trend of returning to levels seen in 9472 BAAS ET AL. J. VIROL. a graphical network of biologically related genes derived from known relationships present in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. Many networks can be constructed, but we limited our investigation to the networks that were most prevalent at the time of peak viral replication (i.e., day 2 for both sets of mice) and to networks that showed a significant over-representation of focus genes. Because responses of young and old SARS-CoV-infected mice differed more than they resembled one another, the top functional network identified in young mice was not the same as the top functional network identified in aged mice. In young SARS-CoV-infected mice, genes participating in cell cycle, cellular development, and hematological system development and function were computationally postulated to show regulatory interactions. In aged mice, genes participating in immune response, inflammatory disease, and cell-to-cell signaling and interaction were computationally postulated to show regulatory interactions. Although each of these networks was identified and represents the most prevalent interaction occurring in young or aged mice, the networks are not exclusive to either group.\r\n To get a more complete comparison using both groups of mice, we combined the top young network (dark blue outline) and the top aged network (light blue outline) to construct a merged network, shown in Fig. 6 . The network analyses reveal that differential gene regulation does not happen in isolation, but genes within pathways show interactions that constitute a network. The network diagram shows these interactions: both direct (solid lines) and indirect (dashed lines) interactions among these genes. The left panel in Fig. 6A illustrates that during peak viral replication in young SARS-CoV-infected mice, there is a general downregulation of \"cell cycle\"-type interactions but some upregulation of \"immune response\"type interactions that we originally identified using data from aged mice. The aged SARS-CoV-infected mice show a much more robust upregulation of the \"immune response\" network (many showing \u05465-fold upregulation) without any downregulation in the \"cell cycle\" network during peak viral replication (Fig. 6A) . The presence of so many highly upregulated immune genes in the aged SARS-CoV-infected mice suggests an uncontrolled response to virus infection. Interestingly, although the young SARS-CoV-infected mice seem to show a greater number of differentially expressed \"cell cycle\"-type genes than aged SARS-CoV-infected mice, when basal levels of these genes are evaluated in mock-infected aged mice, they are already downregulated \u03fe2-fold compared to levels in young mice, with the exclusion of Egr1 and Nr4a1 (unchanged) and Igj (upregulated) (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). Possibly, these genes cannot be further downregulated in aged mice, even though in other systems, coronaviruses are capable of inhibiting cell cycle, leading to an accumulation of infected cells in the G 0 \/G 1 phase (4, 36, 37) .\r\n The same merged network is presented in Fig. 6B to show how interactions are affected as the virus is cleared. In the left panel, young mice show a resolution of downregulated \"cell cycle\"-type genes (\u03f330% less) and resolution of upregulated \"immune response\"-type genes as virus infection resolves. Notably in this phase, Hla-f, Hla-c, and B2m are now upregulated, while Cd8a and Cd8b still show a strong absence of transcripts, a finding perhaps indicative of a controlled T-cell receptor signaling progression (this trend is also seen at day 5). The right panel shows how the immune response affects cell cycle genes. The immune response is still induced robustly in aged mice and now at 7 days postinfection, genes involved in cell cycle, cellular development, and hematological system development and function are also beginning to be induced; this profile mimics the histologic evidence of lung repair on days 5 and 7 (30) . Cxcl10 (Ip-10), Ccl2 (Mip-1), Irf7, and Isg15 (G1p2) are still highly upregulated, even as virus is cleared, and are indicators that this heightened immune response is not required for viral clearance and may be responsible for immunopathology.\r\n The present study was motivated by our poor understanding of the relationship between ageing and the host response to virus infection. It has been long known that young and old mice respond quite differently to infection with different viruses (15, 25, 43) . We therefore compared gene expression profiles from the lungs of young and old mice infected with SARS-CoV to define the extent to which the host response determined the outcome of infection and identified differences in the pattern, magnitude, and duration of the host response to SARS-CoV infection in the two groups of mice. A comparison of gene expression profiles in mock-infected young and old mice provided additional insights into the effect of age on gene expression, and the comparison of SARS-CoV-infected mice from the two age groups allowed us a glimpse of the immune response to a respiratory pathogen within the framework of senescence.\r\n The aged BALB\/c mouse is a valuable model for SARS because it allows the analysis of four outcome measures: quantitative virology, clinical symptoms, histopathological changes, and immunohistochemistry in the lungs (30, 40) . Of these outcomes, only quantitative virology can be studied in young SARS-CoV-infected BALB\/c mice. Our study provides host gene expression as an additional outcome measure in the context of a head-to-head comparison of aged and young BALB\/c mouse models of SARS. Gene expression analysis revealed a transcriptional profile in aged mice that indicates a more robust response to virus infection than in young mice: a greater number of genes are transcribed, and transcripts have a greater magnitude of change. The peak immune response in young mice corresponds to the peak in viral replication, and the on March 20, 2020 by guest http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/ transcripts regress to basal levels as the virus is cleared. Aged mice also exhibit a peak host immune response corresponding to the peak in viral replication, and the delay in viral clearance in aged mice is accompanied by a delay in the return of gene expression to basal levels. In addition, a subset of genes is induced in a second wave of a biphasic response, corresponding to the influx and activation of T lymphocytes and severe histopathologic changes in the lungs (Chen et al., unpublished) .\r\n The changes associated with senescence that have been described in the literature mainly pertain to adaptive immune responses; the components of the innate response have not been studied as well. Innate immunity may hold clues to explain the increased morbidity in the elderly since this arm of the immune system may become progressively more important in aging individuals as a means to fill the \"immunologic gap\" that appears as adaptive immunity wanes. In addition to waning immune responses with advancing age, changes in lung structure and function, such as loss of elastin fibers, decreases in the number of capillaries per alveolus, decreases in the efficiency of mucociliary clearance, or decreased respiratory capacity, likely play a role in host response to respiratory infection (24) . Our findings in aged and young SARS-CoV-infected mice are consistent with what has been seen in previous studies of primary viral infection in aged mice, with influenza virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Friend virus, E55\u03e9 murine leukemia virus, and respiratory syncytial virus, where clearance of virus in aged mice was delayed compared to young mice. These studies have led investigators to conclude that the aging immune system is not abated but is simply functioning at a level different than that of young mice (15, 25, 43) . In young mice, type I interferon was detected within hours of primary viral infection with influenza virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and E55\u03e9 murine leukemia virus (15, 25) . In aged mice, the detection of type I interferon was not as straightforward, and the interferon response that was detected may or may not have been functional (15, 25) . Type I interferon has previously been identified as an enhancer of NK cell cytotoxicity in other studies of primary infection in aged animals and may play a role in depletion of nonspecific T cells to initiate expansion of antigen-specific T cells (16) . NK cells are critical to the removal of intracellular pathogens, and nonspecific Tcell depletion may be necessary to provide \"space\" for the proliferation and expansion of T cells specific to newly introduced pathogen (16, 25, 28) . Both in mice and in humans, the ability of type I interferon to enhance cytotoxicity of NK cells, deplete nonspecific T cells, and expand antigen-specific T cells decreases with age (16, 25, 28, 34) . The remodeled immune system of the aged could play a role in delaying clearance of virus.\r\n In our gene expression study of SARS-CoV-infected mice, beta-interferon transcription was more prevalent in aged mice than young. Although we did not measure beta-interferon activity levels in the present study, the upregulated transcription of interferon-stimulated genes suggests that the beta interferon produced by aged mice is functionally active (see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material). High levels of beta interferon may be necessary to clear virus in the aged mice infected with SARS-CoV. In aged mice, Ifnb mRNA showed the greatest upregulation at day 2, which corresponded with an approximate dou-bling of the number of pDCs detected in the lungs (22.2 \u03eb 10 4 \/lung, \u03f311% of total CD3 \u03ea CD11b \u03ea CD19 \u03ea lung leukocytes) (Chen et al., unpublished) . pDCs are considered firstline sentinels in immune surveillance and are capable of producing large amounts of type I interferon (2, 8, 9, 23, 33) and have been found to produce type I interferon during coronavirus infection (3) .\r\n We speculate that the immune dysregulation observed in aged mice may contribute to the damage detected in the lungs by an immunopathological mechanism. The aged mice, experiencing infection with SARS-CoV, show an upregulation of an abundance of host cellular genes in response to the virus but fail to bring this response under control even as the virus is cleared, whereas young mice are able to clear SARS-CoV rapidly and show a controlled host response. Because RNA from the infected lungs was used for gene expression analyses, it is certainly possible that some of the changes occurred in cells that were productively infected and other changes were in activated bystander cells or in cells that phagocytosed viral antigen but were not productively infected. Even if these different types of cells could be sorted and these experiments were not constrained by SARS biosafety containment protocols, it is unlikely differences could be distinguished among these cellular subgroupings. Even with this caveat, the virus leaves behind a unique functional genomics \"fingerprint\" in the aged host compared to the young host that may be a signature of imminent or ongoing morbidity. A similar association of immune dysregulation with lung damage was seen in BALB\/c mice infected with the highly virulent reconstructed 1918 influenza virus. Using our laboratory's historical microarray database, we compared the data from SARS-CoV-infected mice in this experiment to a set of data from young BALB\/c mice that were infected with a human influenza A virus (A\/ Texas\/36\/91) isolated during a seasonal epidemic of influenza or reconstructed highly virulent human influenza A virus (r1918) (18) . Although the mechanism by which these viruses elicit host responses may differ because SARS-CoV-infected mice have a prominent infiltration of NK cells, macrophages, and pDCs, while influenza-infected mice have a prominent infiltration of neutrophils, trends in host response to different respiratory viruses may be informative. Aged SARS-CoV mice show a more similar host response to young mice infected with the highly virulent reconstructed 1918 influenza virus that replicated to high titer and was associated with prominent pulmonary pathology and death by day 5 postinfection (see Fig. S8 in the supplemental material) than to mice infected with a nonlethal epidemic influenza virus. The similarity of the genomic profiles of mice infected with a nonlethal SARS coronavirus to those of mice infected with a highly virulent and lethal influenza virus suggests that the sustained response to infection seen in aged SARS-CoV-infected mice may play a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease.\r\n Translating this molecular signature into a common denominator within the context of other respiratory virus infection and morbidity in an aged host is an important question to answer with future studies. The continued use of older animals to examine the host response to different respiratory pathogens will provide an important framework within which the impact of senescence (e.g., immune, cellular, structural (24) on disease progression and the mechanisms of increased severity of respiratory tract infections in the elderly can be better understood.","sha":"d745b87efec393437fab144f59c78f5a369db42c","publish_time":"2008-07-16","authors":"Baas, Tracey; Roberts, Anjeanette; Teal, Thomas H.; Vogel, Leatrice; Chen, Jun; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Katze, Michael G.; Subbarao, Kanta","journal":"Journal of Virology","doi":"10.1128\/jvi.00489-08","Title":"Journal of Virology","H index":271.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"The fastest-growing group in the U.S. population comprises individuals over the age of 65 years (42) , with the maximum life span of an individual currently estimated at 120 years (7) .

Many networks can be constructed, but we limited our investigation to the networks that were most prevalent at the time of peak viral replication (i.e., day 2 for both sets of mice) and to networks that showed a significant over-representation of focus genes. To get a more complete comparison using both groups of mice, we combined the top young network (dark blue outline) and the top aged network (light blue outline) to construct a merged network, shown in Fig. The presence of so many highly upregulated immune genes in the aged SARS-CoV-infected mice suggests an uncontrolled response to virus infection. The same merged network is presented in Fig. 6B to show how interactions are affected as the virus is cleared. We therefore compared gene expression profiles from the lungs of young and old mice infected with SARS-CoV to define the extent to which the host response determined the outcome of infection and identified differences in the pattern, magnitude, and duration of the host response to SARS-CoV infection in the two groups of mice. Aged mice also exhibit a peak host immune response corresponding to the peak in viral replication, and the delay in viral clearance in aged mice is accompanied by a delay in the return of gene expression to basal levels.

Our results indicate that TLR4 plays an important role in respiratory CoV pathogenesis.","text_body":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a disease that was initially observed in 2002 and led to approximately 8,000 affected individuals in multiple countries with over 700 deaths (1, 24, 47, 48) . The causative agent of SARS was subsequently identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV) termed SARS-CoV (8, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37) . Although SARS-CoV infections following the initial outbreak in 2002 and 2003 have been limited primarily to laboratory personnel, the identification of an animal reservoir for the virus raises concern about the potential for future outbreaks (25) .\r\n The pathogenesis of SARS has been difficult to study, in part because no animal model is able to fully recapitulate the morbidity and mortality observed in infected humans (35) . Infection of a number of inbred mouse strains, including BALB\/c, C57BL\/6, and 129S, with primary human isolates of SARS-CoV results in the replication of the virus within the lung tissue without the subsequent development of readily apparent clinical disease (11, 16, 41) . Infection of aged BALB\/c mice results in clinically apparent disease that more closely mimics some aspects of SARS in humans (36) . However, immune responses in aged mice are known to be altered (5, 15) , and thus, the mechanisms that control the induction of disease may differ between adult and aged mice. Recent work has demonstrated that serial passage of SARS-CoV in mice results in a mouse adaptation that leads to more profound replication of the virus in the lung (28, 34) . However, the time to death from this mouse-adapted SARS-CoV is 3 to 5 days, which is much more rapid than the time to mortality observed in fatal cases of SARS in humans.\r\n Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that SARS-CoV is most closely related to group 2 CoVs, which include the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) family (39) . Thus, information gathered by infection of mice with closely related members of the group 2 CoVs may further contribute to our understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis in humans. While many strains of MHV induce primarily hepatic and central nervous system diseases (6, 7, 12, 18, 21, 23, 40) , a recent study demonstrated that intranasal (i.n.) infection of A\/J mice with MHV type 1 (MHV-1) induces pulmonary injury that shares several pathological characteristics with SARS-CoV infection of humans (2, 3, 9, 29, 43) .\r\n In the current study, we examined the relationship between MHV-1 replication in the lungs and the severity of disease in four inbred strains of mice: A\/J, BALB\/c, C57BL\/6, and C3H\/ HeJ. Our results demonstrate that MHV-1 replicates to similar levels in the lung in each of these inbred strains of mice regardless of their relative levels of susceptibility, as measured by weight loss and clinical illness. Both A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice exhibited enhanced weight loss and clinical illness following i.n. MHV-1 infection compared to BALB\/c and C57BL\/6 mice. Analysis of many different inbred mouse strains confirmed A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice as the most susceptible to i.n. MHV-1 infection. Interestingly, C3H\/HeJ mice harboring a natural mutation in the gene that encodes Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) that disrupts its normal function exhibited greatly increased morbidity and mortality after i.n. MHV-1 infection compared to wild-type C3H\/HeN mice. Our results indicate that TLR4 plays an important role in respiratory CoV pathogenesis.\r\n A\/JCr, BALB\/cAnNCr, C3H\/HeJCr, C3H\/HeNCr, and C57BL\/6NCr mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD).

Female mice aged 6 to 12 weeks were used for all experiments. The University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experimental procedures involving the use of animals.\r\n Viruses and infection of mice. MHV-1 was purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and propagated in DBT cells. While under light anesthesia with isoflurane, mice were inoculated i.n. with 5 \u03eb 10 3 PFU of MHV-1 in a total volume of 50 l. The weight of each mouse was determined and recorded daily. Each mouse was assessed a daily illness score based on the following scale: 0, no apparent illness; 1, slightly ruffled fur; 2, ruffled fur, active; 3, ruffled fur, inactive; 4, ruffled fur, inactive, hunched posture; 5, moribund or dead.\r\n BAL and lung cell isolation. Collection of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and the preparation of single-cell suspensions from the BAL fluid and lung tissue were performed as previously described (30) . Preparation and quantitation of lymphocytes in the BAL fluid were performed as previously described (30) .\r\n Intracellular-cytokine staining. Lung mononuclear cells (2 \u03eb 10 6 cells\/ml) were stimulated with 50 ng\/ml of phorbol myristate acetate (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 500 ng\/ml of ionomycin (Sigma) in the presence of 10 g\/ml of brefeldin A (Sigma) for 5 h at 37\u00b0C in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 10 U of penicillin G\/ml, 10 g of streptomycin sulfate\/ml, 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 5 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (Gibco), and 10 mM HEPES (Gibco). After incubation, the cells were blocked with purified anti-Fc\u2425RII\/III monoclonal antibody (clone 93; eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and stained with monoclonal antibodies against CD4 (clone RM4-5; eBioscience) and CD8 (clone 53-6.7; eBioscience). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter lysing solution was used to fix the lung mononuclear cells and lyse the red blood cells. The cells were then washed with permeabilization buffer (staining buffer containing 0.5% saponin; Sigma) and stained with anti-gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425) monoclonal antibody (clone XMG1.2; eBioscience). The stained cells were analyzed on a FACSCanto (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Single-color controls were used for compensation. Lymphocytes were gated based on forward-scatter and side-scatter properties and were subsequently analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). Background staining was determined by using cells that were left unstimulated.\r\n Histology. Whole lungs with the heart attached were harvested from mice at various time points after MHV-1 infection. The lungs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) prior to being processed and paraffin embedded at the University of Iowa Comparative Pathology Laboratory. The paraffin blocks were sectioned at 5-m thickness. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin at the University of Iowa Central Microscopy Core.\r\n Histopathologic examination and scoring. A board-certified veterinary pathologist who was blinded to the study groups examined the tissue sections. Tissues were initially screened to define the breadth of morphological parameters that were of interest for subsequent histopathologic grading. Edema formation and cellular inflammation were graded (1 to 4 per animal) for distribution and severity in tissue sections. Histopathologic grading of lesions was modified from previous descriptions (4, 14, 38) . The distribution of lesions was graded as follows: 1, absent to rare detection; 2, localized focus to multifocal, involving less than \u03f31\/3 of the lung parenchyma; 3, multifocal to coalescing foci, involving \u03f31\/3 to 2\/3 of the lung parenchyma; and 4, coalescing to diffuse, involving more than \u03f32\/3 of the lung parenchyma. Edema was defined as eosinophilic seroproteinaceous fluid within the alveolar lumen. The edema severity was graded as follows: 1, absent to rare detection; 2, mild, partially filling the alveoli with lacy to wispy fluid; 3, moderate, with partial filling of alveoli by pools of eosinophilic fluid; and 4, severe, with complete filling of alveoli by eosinophilic fluid with absence of detectable air space. During infection, pulmonary inflammation was primarily composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, and variable numbers of neutrophils. This infiltrate was localized to interstitial and perivascular spaces with a general lack of airway involvement. Accordingly, the severity of cellular infiltration was graded as follows: 1, absent to rare detection of interstitial inflammatory cells; 2, mild, with increased cellularity with minimal alteration of alveolar septa\/interstitium thickness; 3, moderate, with increased cellularity of alveolar septa\/interstitium with increased wall thickness and perivascular aggregates of inflammatory cells; 4, severe, with coalescing aggregates of perivascular inflammatory cells, increased cellularity and thickness of the alveolar septa\/ interstitium with increased inflammation \"spillover\" into the alveolar lumen. Total edema and total inflammation scores were assessed as the summation of the respective parameter distribution and severity grades.\r\n Plaque assays. Whole lungs were harvested from MHV-1-infected A\/J, BALB\/c, C3H\/HeJ, and C57BL\/6 mice; weighed; and disrupted using an Ultra-Turrax T 25 basic homogenizer (IKA, Wilmington, NC). Supernatants were collected and stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C prior to further analysis. HeLa cells (ATCC) stably transfected with the MHV receptor (10) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 10 U\/ml penicillin G (Gibco, Grand Island, NY), and 10 g\/ml streptomycin sulfate (Gibco). Serial dilutions of the supernatants were performed in serum-free DMEM (Gibco) supplemented as described above and subsequently incubated on HeLa cells expressing the MHV receptor for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. The plates were rocked every 10 min and overlaid overnight with 2 ml DMEM (Gibco) containing 10% FCS (Atlanta Biologicals) and supplemented as described above. The next day, the plates were stained with 2\u03eb minimal essential medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 4% FCS (Atlanta Biologicals), 0.26% sodium bicarbonate (Gibco), 10 U\/ml penicillin G (Gibco), 10 g\/ml streptomycin sulfate (Gibco), 1.8% SeaKem ME agarose (Cambrex, North Brunswick, NJ), and 0.01% neutral red (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Plaques were counted after 2 to 4 h with the assistance of a light box.\r\n Measurement of airway function. Airway function was measured in conscious, unrestrained, and spontaneously breathing mice using a barometric whole-body plethysmograph (Buxco Electronics, Wilmington, NC) as described previously (13) . Baseline enhanced-pause (Penh) values for each mouse were averaged over 5 min and recorded prior to and on a daily basis following MHV-1 infection.\r\n Statistics. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad (San Diego, CA) InStat software. Experiments involving three or more groups and demonstrating a Gaussian distribution were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a Bonferroni multiple-comparison posttest. Experiments with three or more groups that failed to demonstrate a Gaussian distribution were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis test and a Dunn multiple-comparison posttest. Experiments involving two groups with a Gaussian distribution were analyzed using an unpaired t test. Survival data were analyzed using a Mantel-Cox log rank test. A P value of \u03fd0.05 was considered significant.\r\n Since A\/J and C3H\/St mice infected with MHV-1 exhibited increased mortality compared to BALB\/cJ and C57BL\/6J mice (2), we first determined if relative susceptibility was correlated with enhanced weight loss and signs of overt clinical illness, such as ruffled fur, inactivity, and a hunched posture. The mice were weighed and scored for illness daily for 9 days following i.n. infection with 5 \u03eb 10 3 PFU of MHV-1. A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice exhibited extensive weight loss between days 3 and 9 postinfection (p.i.) (Fig. 1A ). In addition, both strains of mice exhibited high mortality rates between days 7 and 9 p.i. In contrast, BALB\/c mice lost a moderate amount of weight between days 2 and 3 p.i., with slow recovery evident over the next 6 days. C57BL\/6 mice exhibited no weight loss following MHV-1 infection.\r\n The mice were also monitored daily for overt signs of clinical illness. A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice first exhibited signs of clinical illness by days 2 and 3 after infection with MHV-1, respectively, that increased in severity through day 9 p.i. (Fig. 1B) .\r\n BALB\/c mice exhibited moderate clinical illness between days 2 and 8 p.i., whereas C57BL\/6 mice never exhibited any signs of clinical illness following MHV-1 infection.\r\n To determine if the magnitude of MHV-1 replication in the lungs was correlated with the relative amount of weight loss and systemic illness, lung virus titers were determined at days 4, 9, 14, and 21 p.i. The amount of virus recovered from the lung did not correlate with either weight loss or the development of clinical illness (Fig. 2) . At day 4 p.i., all four strains of mice exhibited high titers of MHV-1 in the lungs, with A\/J mice exhibiting significantly (P \u03fd 0.05) higher virus titers than C3H\/ HeJ mice. There was no significant (P \u03fe 0.05) difference in the virus titers between A\/J mice and either BALB\/c or C57BL\/6 mice. Interestingly, C57BL\/6 mice, which did not exhibit weight loss or show any signs of clinical illness, had levels of virus that were not statistically different (P \u03fe 0.05) than those of C3H\/HeJ and BALB\/c mice, which both exhibited weight loss and clinical disease at this time point (Fig. 1) . Titers in the lung dropped by 10-to 100-fold by day 9 p.i., remaining low but detectable in the lungs of some BALB\/c and C57BL\/6 mice through day 21 p.i. A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice exhibited high mortality rates between days 7 and 10 p.i.; however, virus titers measured from the surviving mice at days 9, 14, and 21 p.i. did not differ significantly from those of either BALB\/c or C57BL\/6 mice. Virus replication was also examined in the spleen, liver, and brain. Small amounts of virus could be recovered from the spleen and brain at day 4 p.i. and subsequently fell below detection limits by day 9 p.i. in all four strains of mice. Low virus titers were also observed in the liver in all four strains of mice through day 9 p.i., subsequently decreasing below the limit of detection by day 21 p.i. (data not shown). These results indicate that the relative severity of MHV-1-induced disease does not correlate with the virus titer.\r\n Histological examination of lung sections. Lungs from A\/J, BALB\/c, C3H\/HeJ, and C57BL\/6 mice infected with MHV-1 were harvested at days 5, 7, and 9 p.i. and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Figure 3A to D shows a representative section taken at day 9 p.i. from each strain of mice at low power to demonstrate the relative amount of edema that developed in the lungs of each strain. In all mouse strains examined, MHV-1 infection induced a diffuse mononuclear cell infiltration in the lungs that was primarily localized to interstitial and perivascular spaces with a general lack of airway involvement. We did not observe significant strain-dependent differences in the distribution of inflammatory cells in the lung. However, A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice exhibited more prominent pathological changes in the lung, including hyaline membrane formations, syncytia, fibrin depositions, cellular necrosis, and severe pulmonary edema (Fig. 3E to H) . A\/J mice exhibited significantly higher (P \u03fd 0.05) total inflammatory scores at days 5 and 9 p.i. than C57BL\/6 mice (Fig. 4A ). We did observe increased edema in A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice that had survived to day 9 p.i. compared to BALB\/c and C57BL\/6 mice, neither of which exhibited either signs of clinical disease or weight loss at this time point (Fig. 4B ). In particular, at day 9 p.i., C57BL\/6 mice exhibited significantly less (P \u03fd 0.05) total edema than either A\/J or C3H\/HeJ mice. Our results demonstrate that both A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice develop increased MHV-1-induced pulmonary edema compared to BALB\/c and C57BL\/6 mice.\r\n Magnitude and kinetics of pulmonary inflammation. The increased morbidity and mortality exhibited by A\/J and C3H\/ HeJ mice occurred during the time frame when a virus-specific adaptive immune response would develop. Therefore, we next determined the magnitude and examined the character of the pulmonary inflammation induced by MHV-1 infection. To determine more precisely the relative magnitude of the pulmonary inflammation induced by MHV-1 infection, we examined the cellularity in the BAL fluid and lung parenchyma. Increasing numbers of mononuclear cells were observed in the BAL fluid between days 5 and 9 p.i. in all strains (Fig. 5A) . In contrast, total mononuclear cell counts in the lungs of A\/J, BALB\/c, and C57BL\/6 mice were similar between days 5 and 9 p.i., whereas C3H\/HeJ mice exhibited a sharp increase in the number of mononuclear cells at days 7 to 9 p.i. (Fig. 5B) . Examination of the character of the inflammatory cells within the BAL fluid of BALB\/c and C57BL\/6 mice revealed that the majority of the infiltrating cells were lymphocytes and macrophages ( Fig. 6A to C) . In contrast, A\/J mice showed a higher proportion of neutrophils at day 5 p.i., which subsequently declined by days 7 and 9 p.i. Interestingly, a high proportion of neutrophils were found in the BAL of C3H\/HeJ mice at all time points examined. These results indicate that the increased severity of disease exhibited by A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice is not the result of an increased magnitude of pulmonary inflammation compared to BALB\/c and C57BL\/6 mice.\r\n Airway function. To determine the effect of MHV-1 infection on airway function, we monitored baseline Penh in A\/J, BALB\/c, C3H\/HeJ, and C57BL\/6 mice between days 3 and 7 following i.n. MHV-1 infection. A\/J mice exhibited elevated baseline Penh between days 3 and 7 p.i. (Fig. 7) . C3H\/HeJ mice exhibited increased Penh relative to BALB\/c and C57BL\/6 mice starting between days 5 and 7 p.i. BALB\/c and C57BL\/6 mice exhibited only small or no increases in Penh between days 3 and 5 p.i., consistent with the clinical measures described above (Fig. 1) . Thus, our results demonstrate that both A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice exhibit increased Penh following acute MHV-1 infection compared to BALB\/c and C57BL\/6 mice.\r\n Relative MHV-1 susceptibilities of inbred mice. We sought to further define the host genetic factors that mediate susceptibility to MHV-1-induced disease in inbred mice. To examine both major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-linked, and non-MHC-linked factors, disease severity was evaluated in 10 additional strains of inbred mice to determine their relative susceptibilities to i.n. MHV-1 infection. C57BL\/6 mice (H-2 b MHC) were resistant to MHV-1-induced disease as measured by weight loss (Fig. 8A ). In contrast, BALB.B10 mice (also H-2 b MHC, with BALB\/c background genes) exhibited a moderate amount of weight loss early (days 3 and 4) after infection followed by rapid recovery. Among strains of mice expressing the MHC H-2 d haplotype, BALB\/c mice lost approximately 10% of their starting weight by day 3 p.i., gradually recovering weight over the next 2 weeks (Fig. 8B) . B10.D2, DBA\/2J, and NZB\/BlNJ mice failed to lose substantial weight following MHV-1 infection, indicating that they are resistant to MHV-1-induced weight loss. Among H-2 k mice, CBA\/J and B10.BR mice exhibited moderate weight loss between days 3 and 9 p.i. Moreover, like BALB\/c and BALB.B10 mice, BALB.K mice exhibited a moderate loss of weight between days 3 and 5 p.i., rebounding quickly afterwards. As expected, infection of the mixed MHC haplotype A\/J mice also resulted in rapid weight loss and high mortality. The above-mentioned results indicate that most strains expressing either the H-2 b or the H-2 d MHC haplotype are resistant to MHV-1-induced disease. Strains that carry the BALB\/c background genes exhibit moderate susceptibility to MHV-1-induced weight loss independent of their MHC disposition. All mice expressing H-2 k MHC haplotypes exhibit moderate susceptibility to MHV-1induced weight loss Because C3H\/HeJ mice lack a functional TLR4 gene, we wanted to further assess the role of TLR4 in susceptibility to MHV-1-induced disease. We first examined either wild-type or TLR4-deficient mice on the C57BL\/10 (H-2 b MHC haplotype) background. Like C57BL\/6 mice, C57BL\/10SnJ mice were resistant to MHV-1-induced weight loss (Fig. 9A) . C57BL\/10ScN mice, which are homozygous for a null mutation of the TLR4 gene (31, 45), did not exhibit weight loss that was significantly different from that of C57BL\/10SnJ mice. Thus, TLR4 deficiency does not render a resistant strain susceptible to MHV-1-induced disease. We next examined the effect of TLR deficiency within the susceptible C3H H-2 k mice. C3H\/HeJ mice lost approximately 20% of their body weight by day 8 p.i. (Fig.  9B ). In addition, C3H\/HeJ mice also exhibited a high mortality rate, with the majority of the mice dying between days 7 and 10 p.i. C3H\/HeN mice (wild-type TLR4) followed a weight loss trend similar to that of C3H\/HeJ mice during the first 7 days of infection, but C3H\/HeN mice then exhibited more robust recovery than C3H\/HeJ mice. These results indicate that TLR4 deficiency increases susceptibility to MHV-1-induced disease within C3H mice.\r\n Role of TLR4 in susceptibility to MHV-1-induced disease. The results described above show, most remarkably, marked differences in mortality between the C3H\/HeJ mice that lacked a functional TLR4 gene and their C3H\/HeN controls that contained a fully functional TLR4 gene. C3H\/HeJ mice exhibited an approximately 70% mortality rate by day 14 p.i., whereas C3H\/HeN mice exhibited only 20% mortality during this time frame (Fig. 10) . Increased mortality was not associated with an increase in virus replication in the lung, as virus titers were not significantly different between the C3H\/HeJ and C3H\/HeN mice at day 4 or 7 p.i. (data not shown). TLR4 has recently been implicated as an important factor in controlling the development of acute lung injury (20) . Therefore, we monitored Penh daily in C3H\/HeJ and C3H\/HeN mice following i.n. MHV-1 infection. Surprisingly, C3H\/HeN mice exhibited increased baseline Penh compared to C3H\/HeJ mice between days 2 and 7 p.i. (Fig. 11) . These results demonstrate that despite exhibiting improved airway function, C3H\/HeJ mice that lacked a functional TLR4 gene exhibited increased susceptibility to MHV-1-induced morbidity and mortality.\r\n The cell types that trafficked into the lungs of wild-type C3H\/HeN and TLR4-deficient C3H\/HeJ mice were examined by flow cytometry at days 5 and 7 following acute MHV-1 infection (Fig. 12) . No significant differences were observed for CD4 \u03e9 CD3 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 CD3 \u03e9 T cells or CD19 \u03e9 CD3 \u03ea B cells. C3H\/HeJ mice exhibited increased total numbers of NK cells (DX-5 \u03e9 CD3 \u03ea cells; P \u03fd 0.05 at day 7 only), neutrophils (CD11b \u03e9 CD11c \u03ea Ly6C \u03e9 Ly6G \u03e9 cells; P \u03fd 0.05 at day 5 only), and alveolar macrophages (CD11b \u03e9 CD11c \u03e9 MHC class II low Siglec F \u03e9 cells). These results suggest that C3H\/HeJ mice exhibit increased numbers of pulmonary NK cells and granulocytes following acute MHV-1 infection compared to wildtype C3H\/HeN mice.\r\n We next sought to determine if the adaptive immune response to MHV-1 was altered in TLR4-deficient mice in order to better understand the enhanced mortality observed in mice that lacked functional TLR4 signaling. Because the immunodominant T-cell epitopes are not currently defined for MHV-1, we quantified the frequency of CD4 and CD8 T cells capable of making IFN-\u2425 following stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin. We compared the total numbers of (Fig. 13 ). C3H\/HeJ mice had a significantly (P \u03fd 0.05) higher total number of IFN-\u2425-producing CD4 T cells in the lung than C3H\/HeN mice. The two strains had similar total numbers of IFN-\u2425-producing CD8 T cells in the lung at this time point. These results indicate that in the absence of signals through TLR4, the CD4 T-cell response in the lung is increased following MHV-1 infection of C3H mice, which may contribute to enhanced morbidity and mortality.\r\n The underlying immune mechanisms that contribute to the development of SARS in humans remain poorly understood, in part because few cases of the disease have occurred since the initial outbreak in 2002 and 2003. Mice represent an excellent model system for the study of virus-host interactions due to the generation of inbred strains of mice and the ability to manipulate the genome. Thus, the successful development of a smallanimal model that closely resembles the key pathological findings of the human disease would significantly improve our ability to examine the pathogenesis of SARS. However, to date, no animal model fully recapitulates the morbidity and mortality observed in infected humans (36) .\r\n A recent report examined the abilities of several MHV strains to produce productive infections in the lung following i.n. administration (2). MHV-1 was shown to replicate in the lung and produce pulmonary pathology in A\/J mice that shared several key characteristics with the lung pathology noted in human SARS cases (3, 9, 29, 43) . In the current study, we examined the disease induced by i.n. administration in several strains of mice and showed that i.n. infection of A\/J and C3H\/ HeJ mice resulted in increased weight loss, clinical illness, and Penh compared to either BALB\/c or C57BL\/6 mice. Several observations indicate that the adaptive immune response may play an important role in the enhanced morbidity and mortality we observed in A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice. First, BALB\/c mice mirror the weight loss observed early after MHV-1 infection of A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice. However, by day 5 p.i., when the adaptive immune response would start to become apparent, BALB\/c mice start to regain weight whereas A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice continue to lose weight. In addition, our preliminary data indicate that depletion of both CD4 and CD8 T cells published data). The factors that drive the weight loss in A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice are currently unknown; however, the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423) represents a likely candidate. Macrophages and T cells are the primary producers of TNF-\u2423, and when it is released in large quantities, TNF-\u2423 production has been associated with cachexia in mice. Antibody-mediated TNF-\u2423 depletion has been shown to ameliorate the weight loss observed following infection with either respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or influenza virus (19) . Thus, TNF-\u2423 likely contributes to the development of weight loss following MHV-1 infection; however, this has yet to be formally tested. Although MHV strains can cause mortality associated with liver disease, we do not believe A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice were succumbing to liver disease. Infection of either A\/J or C3H\/ HeJ mice with a higher dose (2 \u03eb 10 5 PFU) of MHV-1 administered intraperitoneally does not induce disease or mortality in either mouse strain. In addition, we also examined the liver via histology during the course of these studies, and we did not find liver pathology that would be consistent with the time frame during which our mice succumbed to the infection (data not shown).\r\n The increased mortality observed in the A\/J and C3H\/HeJ mice appears to be primarily due to respiratory failure caused by severe pulmonary edema. A recent study suggests that sig- (20) . TLR4-deficient mice were found to be resistant to increased lung elastance and pulmonary edema following either acid-induced or inactivated H5N1 influenza virus-induced acute lung injury (20) . Consistent with findings reported by Imai et al. (20) , we observed that TLR4-deficient mice exhibited improved lung function compared to wild-type controls (Fig. 11 ). TLR4 polymorphisms in humans have been linked to an increase in disease severity following infection with RSV (26, 33, 42) . However, the mechanism that controls this disease enhancement following RSV infection is currently not well understood. We found that TLR4-deficient mice exhibited increased mortality following i.n. MHV-1 infection compared to wild-type controls. The C3H\/HeJ mice succumbed to the infection primarily between days 7 and 10 p.i., suggesting that the TLR4 deficiency impacted a critical event influencing the adaptive immune response that led to the death of these mice. Consistent with a role for the adaptive immune response in mediating the enhanced mortality observed in C3H\/HeJ mice, we demonstrated that the total number of IFN-\u2425-producing CD4 T cells is significantly increased in C3H\/HeJ mice compared to C3H\/HeN mice (Fig. 13) .\r\n Consistent with previous work, our results indicate that the genetic background of the host exerts a profound effect on susceptibility to MHV-1-induced disease. C57BL\/6 and C57BL\/10 mice are extremely resistant to MHV-1-induced disease. TLR4-deficient C57BL\/10ScN did not exhibit any increase in MHV-1-induced morbidity. Our results indicate that the host genetic background influences the requirement for TLR4-mediated signals during MHV-1 infection and that the genetic influences that result in resistance to MHV-1-induced disease are dominant over the requirement for TLR4-mediated signals. With the identification of several new CoVs within the last few years, including SARS-CoV (1, 24, 47, 48) , human CoV HKU1 (46) , and human CoV NL63 (44) , it has become increasing apparent that CoVs can be the cause of significant virus-induced respiratory disease in humans. However, studies examining the immunobiology of CoV infections in the respiratory tract remain scarce. Mice infected i.n. with MHV-1 represent an excellent model of CoV-induced lung injury that may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of CoV infection in humans.

Infection of aged BALB\/c mice results in clinically apparent disease that more closely mimics some aspects of SARS in humans (36) . In the current study, we examined the relationship between MHV-1 replication in the lungs and the severity of disease in four inbred strains of mice: A\/J, BALB\/c, C57BL\/6, and C3H\/ HeJ. Our results demonstrate that MHV-1 replicates to similar levels in the lung in each of these inbred strains of mice regardless of their relative levels of susceptibility, as measured by weight loss and clinical illness. MHV-1 infection compared to wild-type C3H\/HeN mice. The University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experimental procedures involving the use of animals. Collection of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and the preparation of single-cell suspensions from the BAL fluid and lung tissue were performed as previously described (30) . The cells were then washed with permeabilization buffer (staining buffer containing 0.5% saponin; Sigma) and stained with anti-gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425) monoclonal antibody (clone XMG1.2; eBioscience). Single-color controls were used for compensation. Background staining was determined by using cells that were left unstimulated. The lungs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) prior to being processed and paraffin embedded at the University of Iowa Comparative Pathology Laboratory. The paraffin blocks were sectioned at 5-m thickness. Tissues were initially screened to define the breadth of morphological parameters that were of interest for subsequent histopathologic grading. Edema was defined as eosinophilic seroproteinaceous fluid within the alveolar lumen. The edema severity was graded as follows: 1, absent to rare detection; 2, mild, partially filling the alveoli with lacy to wispy fluid; 3, moderate, with partial filling of alveoli by pools of eosinophilic fluid; and 4, severe, with complete filling of alveoli by eosinophilic fluid with absence of detectable air space. During infection, pulmonary inflammation was primarily composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, and variable numbers of neutrophils. Supernatants were collected and stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C prior to further analysis. The next day, the plates were stained with 2\u03eb minimal essential medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 4% FCS (Atlanta Biologicals), 0.26% sodium bicarbonate (Gibco), 10 U\/ml penicillin G (Gibco), 10 g\/ml streptomycin sulfate (Gibco), 1.8% SeaKem ME agarose (Cambrex, North Brunswick, NJ), and 0.01% neutral red (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Plaques were counted after 2 to 4 h with the assistance of a light box. Experiments with three or more groups that failed to demonstrate a Gaussian distribution were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis test and a Dunn multiple-comparison posttest. A P value of \u03fd0.05 was considered significant. with slow recovery evident over the next 6 days. C57BL\/6 mice exhibited no weight loss following MHV-1 infection. To determine if the magnitude of MHV-1 replication in the lungs was correlated with the relative amount of weight loss and systemic illness, lung virus titers were determined at days 4, 9, 14, and 21 p.i. Virus replication was also examined in the spleen, liver, and brain. and subsequently fell below detection limits by day 9 p.i. Low virus titers were also observed in the liver in all four strains of mice through day 9 p.i., Histological examination of lung sections. Lungs from A\/J, BALB\/c, C3H\/HeJ, and C57BL\/6 mice infected with MHV-1 were harvested at days 5, 7, and 9 p.i.

We did not observe significant strain-dependent differences in the distribution of inflammatory cells in the lung.

Advanced age was significantly associated with increased SARS-related deaths, primarily due to the onset of early-and late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis. Infection of aged, but not young, mice with recombinant viruses bearing spike glycoproteins derived from early human or palm civet isolates resulted in death accompanied by pathological changes associated with ARDS. In aged mice, a greater number of differentially expressed genes were observed than in young mice, whose responses were significantly delayed. Differences between lethal and nonlethal virus phenotypes in aged mice could be attributed to differences in host response kinetics rather than virus kinetics. SARS-CoV infection induced a range of interferon, cytokine, and pulmonary wound-healing genes, as well as several genes associated with the onset of ARDS. Mice that died also showed unique transcriptional profiles of immune response, apoptosis, cell cycle control, and stress. Cytokines associated with ARDS were significantly upregulated in animals experiencing lung pathology and lethal disease, while the same animals experienced downregulation of the ACE2 receptor. These data suggest that the magnitude and kinetics of a disproportionately strong host innate immune response contributed to severe respiratory stress and lethality.

The epidemic was severe, resulting in about 8,000 human infections that often progressed to severe acute respiratory disease, pneumonia, and diarrhea, culminating in an \u03f310% fatality rate (10) . Advanced age (\u03fe60 years old) was significantly associated with increased SARS-related deaths due to rapidly progressive respiratory compromise (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) (13, 14) . This pulmonary damage is believed to be caused by both direct viral effects and immunopathological factors (18) . Aging is associated with increased morbidity in a variety of viral infections (e.g., West Nile virus, influenza virus, SARS-CoV, and noroviruses), perhaps because the elderly respond poorly to new antigens compared to younger populations (41, 48) . In addition, a typical feature of advanced age is a general increase in the production and levels in plasma of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in an age-related increase of inflammation (48) . However, the molecular mechanisms governing SARS-CoV pathogenesis are unclear because of the lack of well-defined animal models that exhibit severe pulmonary disease in vulnerable aged populations.\r\n Mortality rates for ARDS, the most severe form of acute lung injury, approach \u03f350%, and the disease affects \u03f31,000,000 people\/year worldwide, ranking it among the most difficult challenges in critical-care medicine (31) . Early ARDS is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which includes a proteinrich edema, an exudative phase with hyaline membranes, and inflammation leading to surfactant dysfunction and severe hypoxia, usually occurring within the first 10 days of acute lung injury. This may progress to an organizing-phase DAD that progresses to pulmonary fibrosis, and both occurred following SARS-CoV infection. ARDS has been reported following SARS-CoV or influenza virus infection and is sporadically reported following herpesvirus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, varicella virus, and hantavirus infections, as well (9, 11, 30, 39, 42, 51) ; however, few well-defined ARDS animal models exist. Select SARS-CoV strains and H5N1 influenza virus are robust models for ARDS in rodents (47, 56) , yet the molecular mechanisms governing ARDS pathogenesis following virus infection are still unclear, especially when placed into the context of aging. Consequently, despite intensive investigation, there are no specific clinical therapies for ARDS except supportive care.\r\n Although the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV infection remain poorly defined, studies of a limited number of human serum (21, 24) and lung (7, 8, 20) samples have provided some insight. During SARS-CoV infection in humans, a dysregulated cytokine and inflammatory response has been proposed to be the cause of the pulmonary pathology characterized at autopsy. High levels of type I interferons and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as CXCL10, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-8 genes, were seen in these patients. Some of these genes, IL-6 and IL-8 genes, as well as others, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423) and IL-1\u2424 genes, have also been associated with ARDS (4, 37) , though gene and protein expression profiles from these patient samples were likely impacted by clinical treatments (steroids and mechanical ventilation) and concurrent preexisting disease, such as chronic heart failure, diabetes, and asthma. In addition, these patient samples are more likely to represent late-stage disease. Animal models of SARS-CoV that recapitulate the ARDS outcome in humans, especially that seen in the elderly, may reveal the initial host-virus responses that contribute to severe end stage lung disease.\r\n We recently isolated an isogenic panel of recombinant infectious-clone (ic) SARS-CoV strains bearing different spike (S) glycoproteins derived from a zoonotic SARS-CoV strain, icHC\/SZ\/61\/03, and from strains identified during the late and early phases of the human epidemic, icUrbani and icGZ02, respectively (47, 57) . In aged mice, icUrbani infection caused mild disease with transient weight loss (44) , while icGZ02 and icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 resulted in severe lung infection progressing to acute-onset DAD, ARDS, and death (47) . In contrast, young mice replicated virus in the absence of clinical disease symptoms and lung pathology, regardless of the origins of the S glycoprotein. These data implicate changes in the S glycoprotein gene as major components of SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Here, we compare host responses over time in nonlethal and lethal mouse models of SARS-CoV using gene expression data to more fully understand the impacts of aging and viral-spike variation on the host response that regulates severe disease phenotypes and the onset of ARDS.\r\n Viruses and cells. The generation and characterization of each of the recombinant ics (icUrbani, icGZ02, and icHC\/SZ\/61\/03) have been described previously (47, 57) . Briefly, all recombinant icSARS-CoV strains were propagated on Vero E6 cells in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), kanamycin (0.25 g\/ml), and gentamicin (0.05 g\/ml) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified CO 2 incubator. All work was performed in a biological safety cabinet in a biosafety level 3 laboratory containing redundant exhaust fans. Personnel were equipped with powered air-purifying respirators with high-efficiency particulate air and organic vapor filters ( (1.3 mg\/mouse)-xylazine (0.38 mg\/mouse) mixture administered intraperitoneally in a 50-l volume. Groups of 20 mice were intranasally inoculated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (mock infection) or 10 5 PFU of icUrbani, icGZ02, or icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 in a 50-l volume. The weights of the mice were monitored daily. At 3, 12, 24, 48 , and 72 h postinfection (p.i.), four mice from each group were euthanized, and lung and serum samples were collected. Because the mice died by 96 h p.i. (47) , mice were sacrificed through 72 h p.i. to ensure good-quality RNA for gene expression studies. For each mouse, one half of a lung was frozen at \u03ea70\u00b0C for RNA isolation. One half of a lung from each mouse was taken for RNA extraction, one quarter of a lung was assayed for viral titers by plaque assay, and one quarter was saved for immunohistochemical detection of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein. All mice were housed under sterile conditions in individually ventilated Sealsafe cages using the Slim-Line system (Tecniplast, Exton, PA). Experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\r\n Virus titers in tissue samples. Lung samples were weighed and homogenized in five equivalent volumes of PBS to generate a 20% solution. The solution was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm under aerosol containment in a table top centrifuge for 5 min, the clarified supernatant was serially diluted in PBS, and 200-l volumes of the dilutions were placed onto monolayers of Vero E6 cells in six-well plates. Following 1 hour of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cells were overlaid with 0.8% agarose-containing medium. Two days later, the plates were stained with neutral red and the plaques were counted.\r\n Immunohistochemistry. All tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for at least 7 days prior to being submitted to the Histopathology Core Facility (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) for paraffin embedding. For detection of SARS-CoV antigen, serial sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and antigen was retrieved by incubating the sections at 100\u00b0C for 15 min with citric acid buffer, pH 6.0. Slides were cooled for 20 min on ice in the same solution. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide. The slides were briefly washed with PBS\/0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with serum from ferrets infected with SARS-CoV (1\/400 in PBS\/0.1% bovine serum albumin) or normal ferret serum (1\/400) for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed, the sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goatanti-ferret immunoglobulin G (KPL, Inc., MD) in PBS\/0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Peroxidase activity was revealed by incubating the slides in 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 10 min, resulting in a bright-red precipitate, followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Tissue sections from noninfected mice were used as negative controls. Lung sections from an experimentally SARS-CoV-inoculated ferret euthanized at 24 h p.i. were used as positive controls. Using polyclonal ferret sera directed against the SARS-CoV N protein, viral N protein was detectable as a measure of replication in the lungs of mice no earlier than 24 h p.i. RNA isolation and genomic precharacterization. One half of a lung from each mouse was transferred to solution D (4 M guanidine thiocyanate with 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.5% sarcosyl, and 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol) and homogenized, and RNA was extracted and purified as described previously (25) . Using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA), total RNA samples from individual mice extracted at the time points 3, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h p.i. were characterized and judged to be pure and intact. The RNA samples were then tested by relative quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (described below) for the presence of the SARS-CoV N gene and cellular transcripts Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Irf7, and B2m to determine if individual samples could be pooled to generate one representative experimental sample to be used for gene expression analysis. Most samples had similar viral and cellular transcripts; therefore, equal-mass quantities of total RNA extracted from individual samples were pooled to create an experimental gene expression sample. Mice at 12 h p.i. showed considerable variation in viral transcripts, with only one out of four young mice and three out of four aged mice with detectable viral transcripts; therefore, a different pooling strategy was used. A representative young-mouse sample of host response to virus at 12 h p.i. was created from total RNA from the one individual sample with viral transcripts, and a representative aged-mouse sample of host response to virus at 12 h p.i. was created from equal-mass quantities of total RNA from the three individual samples for aged mice with viral transcripts. In contrast, viral and cellular transcripts were equivalent at all other time points, allowing the samples to be pooled.\r\n Oligonucleotide microarray analysis. cRNA probes were generated from each pooled RNA sample using the Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Each pooled experimental RNA sample was then cohybridized with its corresponding reference sample, i.e., young experimental mice versus young mock-infected mice and aged experimental mice versus aged mock-infected mice. In addition, one microarray experiment was performed comparing the pooled young mock-infected reference to the pooled aged mock-infected reference to directly gain insight into the effects of aging. All microarray hybridizations were performed with mouse oligonucleotide arrays (G4121B; Agilent Technologies Inc.). Slides were scanned with an Agilent DNA microarray scanner, and image analysis was performed using Agilent Feature Extractor Software (Agilent Technologies Inc.). Each microarray experiment was done with four technical replicates, two with reverse dye hybridization (28) . All data were entered into a custom-designed database (Expression Array Manager) and analyzed with Resolver 6.0 (Rosetta Biosoftware, Seattle, WA) and Spotfire DecisionSite for Functional Genomics 8.1 (Tibco Spotfire, Somerville, MA). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 6.0 (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) was used to functionally annotate genes according to biological processes and canonical pathways. Genes were included in all analyses based on the criteria that the absolute expression level change was twofold or greater with a P value of \u05450.01, unless otherwise stated.\r\n A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (53) was used to identify sets of genes annotated by the same function in the gene ontology (GO) (1) that were differentially expressed during infection. In preparation for this analysis, the Rosetta Resolver System was used to determine the P value of the differential expression of each gene compared to the mock sample. In short, given a list of genes for a single virus\/time point combination ranked in decreasing order by the \u03ealog(P value), GSEA allows the identification of gene sets that are concentrated at the top of the list (signifying significant differential expression). For every function in GO, a GSEA was applied to each virus\/time point combination. A dynamic program method was used to determine the exact P value for each GO function (27) . Only the significances of GO functions with a depth of at least 4 in the GO hierarchy were tested to avoid nonspecific terms. For each function, plots of the \u03ealog(P value) were generated for each virus to track the significance of the function across all time points.\r\n Relative quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Relative quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed to precharacterize individual mouse samples before pooling them, to validate a number of cellular-gene expression changes detected by microarray in pooled samples, and to further characterize a subset of transcripts in an expanded time course of viral infection. Total-RNA samples were treated with DNase using a DNA-free DNase kit (Ambion, Inc. Austin, TX). cDNA was generated using RT reagents and random hexamers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Relative quantitative real-time RT-PCR was run on the ABI 7500 PCR system, using TaqMan chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers and probes specific for the nucleoprotein gene of SARS-CoV have been described previously (12) , and primers and probes specific for mouse cellular genes were purchased from Applied Biosystems as \"gene expression assays.\" Targets were run in quadruplicate following protocols supplied by Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).\r\n Microarray data accession numbers. All data described in this report, including sample information, intensity measurements, gene lists, error analysis, microarray content, and microarray hybridization conditions, will be available after publication in the public domain through Expression Array Manager at http: \/\/expression.viromics.washington.edu in accordance with proposed standards (6) .\r\n As previously shown, infection of young BALB\/c mice with icUrbani, icGZ02, or icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 did not result in weight loss or other clinical signs of disease, regardless of the origin of the S glycoprotein ( Fig. 1A ) (47) . Infection of aged BALB\/c mice with icUrbani resulted in only minor weight loss of 5% with no other signs of clinical disease. In contrast, aged mice infected with either icGZ02 or icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 exhibited significant weight loss of \u03fe10% by 72 h p.i. (Fig. 1B) and exhibited clinical symptoms, including hunching, ruffled fur, and labored breathing. As seen previously in the lungs, DAD, hyaline membrane formation, and alveolitis were noted with icGZ02 and icHC\/ SZ\/61\/03, but not after icUrbani infection (reference 47 and data not shown).\r\n In young mice, icUrbani replicated to peak titers of 8 \u03eb10 7\r\n FIG. 1. Differences in clinical outcomes did not correlate with differences in viral replication efficiencies. Weight loss (A and B) and lung titer (C and D) results are shown for 8-week-old (young) (A and C) and 12-month-old (aged) (B and D) female BALB\/c mice infected with icUrbani, icGZ02, and icHC\/SZ\/61\/03. (A and B) Body weights of infected mice were measured on a daily basis (n \u03ed 5 per group). Weight changes are expressed as the mean percent changes for infected animals relative to the initial weights at day zero. Lung tissues were harvested from infected mice at 3, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h p.i. and assayed for infectious virus as described in Materials and Methods. Tissue samples from five mice were analyzed at each time point. The error bars represent standard deviations. PFU\/g in lungs, while icGZ02 replicated to peak titers of 2 \u03eb 10 7 PFU\/g and icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 replicated to peak titers of 6 \u03eb 10 5 PFU\/g of lung tissue under identical conditions (Fig. 1C ). Viral titers peaked at 24 h p.i. for icGZ02 and icHC\/SZ\/61\/03, after which icGZ02 titers dropped while icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 titers remained consistent. Conversely, icUrbani replicated as efficiently as icGZ02 during the first 24 h p.i. but continued to replicate and reached peak titers at 48 h p.i. While clear differences in viral replication were observed, this did not extend to clinical differences, which were absent in young mice.\r\n In aged mice, peak titers were 1 log unit higher for icGZ02 and 2 log units higher for icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 than titers in young mice (Fig. 1D ). Similar to that in young mice, viral replication peaked at 24 h p.i. for icGZ02 and icHC\/Z\/61\/03 and at 48 h p.i. for icUrbani. Unique to aged mice, viral titers dropped 1 to 2 log units after reaching peak titers for all viruses. While clear differences in clinical outcomes were observed between nonlethal icUrbani and lethal icGZ02 and icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 isolates, these differences could not be attributed to virus growth efficiencies in the lungs of infected aged mice, suggesting that intrinsic properties of the S glycoprotein contributed to differences in pathogenesis.\r\n S glycoproteins affect the tropism of SARS-CoV replication in lungs of infected mice. As the recombinant SARS-CoV panel was isogenic except for defined sequence variations unique to each S glycoprotein gene (47), we next determined if these spike changes altered virus tropism in the lungs of young and aged animals at early and late time points p.i. Using polyclonal ferret sera directed against the SARS-CoV N protein, unique patterns of viral N protein distribution were clearly detectable in the lungs of all infected young and aged mice by 24 h p.i. (Fig. 2) . With icUrbani, a small number of scattered alveolar epithelial cells, with morphology consistent with type II pneumocytes, stained positive for SARS-CoV N protein at 24 h p.i. in both young and aged animals. Increasing numbers of alveolar epithelial cells that expressed viral N protein were observed at 48 and 72 h p.i. (Fig. 2 and data not shown). In contrast, the lungs of mice infected with icGZ02 and icHC\/SZ\/ 61\/03 SARS-CoV displayed distinctly different infection patterns and cell tropism. Viral N protein expression was localized in a small number of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells in the airways and scattered alveolar cells with type II pneumocyte appearance as early as 12 h p.i. (data not shown). By 24 h p.i., viral N protein expression was localized in a moderate number of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells and a few scattered alveolar epithelial cells, again with morphology consistent with type II pneumocytes. By 48 h p.i. the majority of viral N protein was detected in these alveolar epithelial cells, with occasional detection in bronchial cells, bronchiolar cells, and cellular debris that was evident in the preterminal bronchioles. By 72 h p.i., viral N protein expression could be detected only in alveolar epithelial cells with type II pneumocyte appearance, with no bronchial or bronchiolar involvement and little cellular debris. These data indicate that the changes in the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein altered the tropism and pathogenesis in aged mice.\r\n Decreased ACE2 expression correlates with lethal outcome of SARS-CoV infection. Since the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 has been shown to be downregulated by the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein (32) , causing deregulation of the rennin-angiotensin system and exaggeration of acute lung failure, we hypothesized that the expression pattern of ACE2 would be differentially altered during lethal infections compared with nonlethal infections. Several attempts to detect murine ACE2 in the on March 20, 2020 by guest http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/ lungs of infected mice by immunohistochemistry were unsuccessful. As an alternative, we used real-time RT-PCR to examine the regulation of ACE2 in infected lungs (Fig. 3) . In aged mice, at 48 h p.i., ACE2 was downregulated three-and fivefold during lethal icGZ02 and icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 infections, respectively (Fig. 3A) , supporting the idea that downregulation of ACE2 leads to acute lung failure. In contrast, the nonlethal icUrbani-infected mice upregulated ACE2 twofold over mockinfected mice at 48 h (Fig. 3A) , correlating with mouse survival and indicating that the icUrbani S glycoprotein is not as pathogenic as the icGZ02 or icHC\/Sz\/61\/03 S glycoprotein. In young mice, ACE2 expression was significantly downregulated only after infection with icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 at 72 h p.i. (Fig. 3B) . These data show that early downregulation of ACE2 is associated with lethal disease and therefore that ACE2 may potentially play a protective role in SARS-CoV-induced lung injury. Global gene expression in lungs of aged SARS-CoV-infected mice shows an early host response to virus compared with that in young SARS-CoV-infected mice. Pulmonary gene expression comparison in young and aged mice infected with nonlethal and lethal SARS-CoV strains provides an opportunity to identify unique expression signatures associated with lethal infection that could reveal the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV pathogenesis. In young mice, a late response to SARS-CoV infection was observed at 72 h p.i., with similar numbers of genes differentially expressed between mice infected with the different SARS-CoV isolates at each time point (Fig. 4A) . In contrast, the host response in aged mice was characterized by an early (24-h p.i.) onset of differential gene expression that continued up to 72 h p.i. In aged mice, a greater number of genes were differentially expressed during infection with lethal SARS-CoV isolates than with the nonle- thal isolate, with the lethal icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 strain inducing greater numbers (\u03f3200 more) of genes at 24 and 72 h p.i. than the lethal icGZ02 strain. The number of differentially regulated genes correlated with pathogenicity, as in previous results (47) , showed that icUrbani does not cause lethal disease, icGZ02 causes a pathogenic disease that kills 75% of infected mice by day 4, and icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 causes lethal disease in 100% of infected mice starting as early as day 3.\r\n Plotting global gene expression profiles as heat maps showed few commonly regulated genes between the three different viruses at early time points in both young and aged mice, while similarities became apparent at 72 h p.i. (Fig. 4B ). At this later stage of infection in aged and young mice, all three viruses induced a large number of unique genes but also showed the greatest number of common genes (Fig. 5) . Notably, at 72 h p.i., aged mice displayed approximately 10-fold-greater numbers of differentially expressed genes specific to both lethal virus infections than young mice. This trend was also noted at 24 h p.i., and the gene responses specific to lethal isolates in the aged mice outnumbered the gene responses common to all three isolates in aged mice. Interestingly the number of differentially expressed genes unique to lethal infection with icHC\/ SZ\/61\/03 in aged mice was threefold higher than the number of genes unique to lethal infection with icGZ02. These data suggest that the lethal strains may produce severe disease phenotypes by different molecular mechanisms, and survival outcomes may be decided as early as 24 h p.i.\r\n In order to better understand the biological functions associated with lung pathology and lethal disease at early stages of infection, we analyzed the microarray results using GO functional annotations. A GSEA (described in Materials and Methods) of the GO functionally annotated data was used to determine whether specific functional classes of genes were differentially regulated in response to infection. This analysis revealed significant differential expression of genes associated with immune response and apoptotic functional classes to SARS-CoV infection at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 6A) . Lymphocyte-mediated immunity, apoptosis, and inflammatory response functional classes were significantly correlated, with the severity of disease with icGZ02-and icHC\/SZ\/61\/03-infected aged animals showing the greatest statistical association of these classes. Interestingly, by 72 h p.i., these functional classes were no longer correlated with lethal disease but instead showed a common response to SARS-CoV infection. These results could also be observed when the data were plotted as a heat map: the host response to virus infection established at 24 h p.i. seem to determine the outcome for aged mice infected with lethal SARS-CoV strains, which was different from aged mice infected with a nonlethal strain and all infected young mice (Fig.  6B) . Both of these graphical formats showed that the response at 24 h is an important determinant of the disease outcome due to an aberrant host response.\r\n Host response at 24 h after lethal infection. Since the host response at 24 h p.i. is clearly a determinant of the disease outcome, data from this time point were further examined to identify regulatory pathways that might provide a possible explanation for lung pathology and mortality. Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to identify the top canonical pathways induced in the 24-h p.i. data sets from the lethal models. Interferon signaling and acute-phase response were found to be the top canonical pathways induced during icGZ02 and icHC\/SZ\/ 61\/03 infection. The kinetics of a subset of genes from the interferon signaling and acute-phase response pathways was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 7) . As with the functional annotation, expression of genes in these canonical pathways was correlated with pathogenicity in the aged mice at 24 h p.i., but not in young mice (Fig. 8) . The data again revealed that similarities became apparent among the different infection systems at 72 h p.i. Of particular note, the acute-phase response pathway included a number of cytokines previously identified as important in the development of ARDS, including IL-1\u2424, IL-6, and TNF (7, 8) , as well as several members of the complement cascade.\r\n In addition, upon SARS-CoV infection in either young or aged mice, both beta interferon (IFN-\u2424) and IFN-\u2425, but not IFN-\u2423, were significantly upregulated, as previously observed in other animal models of SARS-CoV infection (3, 12) . Many of the ISGs were also upregulated, including Ifit3 and Irf9 genes. The temporal regulation of many of these individual cytokine genes mirrored the kinetics of the global gene expression of host responses; strong upregulation of these genes was observed by 24 h p.i. in aged mice infected with icGZ02 and icHC\/SZ\/61\/03, but these same responses during nonlethal icUrbani infection were delayed until 72 h p.i. These data establish the aged-mouse model as an animal model for virusinduced ARDS and suggest that interferon signaling and the acute-phase response, including the complement system, play pivotal roles in the outcome of viral infection and SARS-CoV pathogenesis.\r\n Differences in the host responses between two lethal SARS-CoV strains. In order to assess the host response differences between the two lethal SARS-CoV strains, which could be on March 20, 2020 by guest http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/ Downloaded from potential determinants of disease outcome, a gene interaction network was created, associated with early host response (24 h p.i.). The network was created by including genes that showed differential regulation that was unique in response to the lethal icGZ02 and icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 infections (Fig. 9) . The network analysis is useful to assess genes acting in concert within and between different functional processes and represents a combined interaction network generated with the top two networks identified by ingenuity pathway analysis (details are provided in the legend to Fig. 9 ). The interaction network shows the four broad functional classes of immune response, apoptosis, cell cycle control, and translational control\/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, acting in concert and shows that icGZ02 infection regulates a subset of the genes whereas icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 infection regulates all of the genes in the network. This enhanced host response to icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 infection at 24 h p.i. provides a possible explanation for prior mortality data (47) that showed that icGZ02 killed 75% of the animals by day 4 whereas HC\/ SZ\/61\/03 killed 100% of the animals starting as early as day 3. The enhanced 24-h p.i. host response to icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 infection is of particular interest, because at this stage of infection, the lungs of aged mice show viral loads of icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 (6 \u03eb 10 5 PFU\/g) lower than the viral loads of icGZ02 (2 \u03eb 10 7 PFU\/g) (Fig. 1) , and therefore, this earlier and enhanced response may potentially represent a host immunopathologic contribution to SARS pathogenesis.\r\n Despite intensive studies, there are currently no specific therapies for ARDS, especially following virus infection, and model systems are desperately needed. While several viruses are known to cause ARDS, including SARS-CoV and influenza virus (9, 11, 30, 39, 42, 51) , the molecular mechanisms of virus-induced ARDS are not well characterized due to the limited number of available animal models. The recent reconstruction of two lethal SARS-CoV infection models in mice that recapitulate the age-related pathogenic phenotype noted in humans (47) provided us with the novel opportunity to characterize host response kinetics and to more fully develop the model for characterizing the molecular mechanisms of virus-induced ARDS. The main goals of this paper were to use systems biology approaches with SARS-CoV-infected aged and young mice to (i) characterize disease progression as dis- In this study, both lethal and nonlethal isolates grew to high titers in the lungs of infected mice but showed different tropisms and abundances of virus-infected cells in the lungs, which were correlated with increased pathological findings. The molecular mechanisms governing tropism differences imparted by the S glycoprotein are unknown. It has been shown that mutations in the S glycoprotein are responsible for differences in receptor affinity during adaptation (34) . All of the S glycoprotein mutants used in this study required ACE2 as their receptors. However, expression of ACE2 alone was not sufficient for replication of the zoonotic strains in human airway epithelium cells (47) . These data suggest that the differences in tropism could reflect differential affinities for murine ACE2 receptors or for DC\/L-Sign coreceptors (34) . Future studies to characterize localizations and levels of ACE2 in murine lung cell types are imperative, as type I and type II human pneumocytes, as well as human bronchial epithelial cells, express ACE2 (19, 50) . Differences in the tropism of target cells and disease severity have also been observed between infections with human and avian influenza virus strains (55) . We speculate that like that of influenza virus, SARS-CoV tropism is a necessary factor but is not sufficient to explain differences in the severity of disease progression (55) . Our observation that downregulation of ACE2 correlates with lethality agrees with earlier studies showing that SARS-CoV S glycoprotein worsens acute lung failure in mice (32) . ACE2 has been suggested to regulate the host response by exaggerating acute lung failure through deregulation of the rennin-angiotensin system, pulmonary vascular tone\/permeability, and epithelial cell survival (23, 31, 32, 35) ; therefore, future experiments evaluating SARS-CoV-induced lung pathology during modulation of RAS gene family members would be informative.\r\n Considering that all three viral isolates replicated to similar titers in the lungs of aged animals, specific changes in the S glycoprotein seem to have triggered an aberrant host response. Similar effects of changes in virulence have been described for variants of the influenza virus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which also show differences in pathogenicity, linked with FIG. 8. Canonical pathway regulation correlates with pathogenesis and lethality. At 24 h p.i., the top canonical pathways associated with lethal infections of aged mice (the significance criteria were \u03fe1.5-fold change with a P value of \u03fd0.01) are interferon signaling (P \u03ed 2.75 \u03eb 10 \u03ea14 for HC\/SZ\/61\/03 and P \u03ed 4.75 \u03eb 10 \u03ea14 for GZ02) and acute-phase response (P \u03ed 1.62 \u03eb 10 \u03ea9 for HC\/SZ\/61\/03 and P \u03ed 5.2 \u03eb 10 \u03ea9 for GZ02). These pathways are not as significantly upregulated by pathogenic but nonlethal infection (aged animals infected with Urbani, interferon signaling, P \u03ed 5.26 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 , and acute-phase response, P \u03ed 1.88 \u03eb 10 \u03ea2 ). Expression data for genes in these pathways are shown as a heat map for young and aged mice infected with icUrbani (U), icGZ02 (G), or icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 (H) for 24 and 72 h p.i. The \"NM\" numbers on the right are GenBank accession numbers.\r\n ROCKX ET AL. J. VIROL.\r\n upregulation of genes associated with apoptosis and tissue injury (25) . SARS-CoV infection in aged mice promotes rapid and fatal disease by influencing, not the kinetics of viral replication, but rather the host response kinetics. Aged mice showed an early host response dominated by the induction of inflammatory cytokines and an acute-phase response at 24 h p.i. The differences in host gene expression, as well as cell tropism and peak viral replication, at early time points in aged mice infected with lethal SARS-CoV isolates indicate that the first 24 h p.i. are critical to the clinical outcome. This is in agreement with the observation that p.i. treatment of SARS-CoV-infected mice with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody did not protect them from death in the absence of virus replication at later time points (46) . Disease outcome was most affected by lymphocyte-mediated immunity, inflammatory response, and apoptosis, as well as pathways of interferon signaling and acute-phase response. In contrast, at 72 h p.i., common patterns of regulation occurred regardless of the disease outcome. Interestingly, an enhanced host response to icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 infection compared with icGZ02 infection was on March 20, 2020 by guest http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/ observed that provides a possible explanation for the enhanced lethality of icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 previously observed (47) . This enhanced host response was indicated by a greater number of differentially expressed genes, larger absolute change of these genes, and a more extensive network of genes acting in concert during icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 infection. Because the more lethal virus showed a lower viral load yet a greater host response, these results suggest a potential immunopathologic contribution to disease by the early response of the host. This phenomenon is similar to responses seen in several animal models of viral pathogenesis (3, 12) , including hemagglutinin\/neuraminidase variants of influenza virus (25, 26) , and could be described as a more inclusive example of the phenomenon previously described as a \"cytokine storm\" (21) . This \"cytokine storm\" observed in SARS-CoV-infected mice paralleled that in SARS patients, including Cxcl-10, IL-1\u2424, IL-6, TNF, and IFN-\u2425 (21) . The kinetics of these cytokine and interferon responses in mice is similar to that in human cases of ARDS, including SARS-CoV-induced cases. Cytokines are significantly increased at the onset of ARDS in nonsurvivors compared to survivors, with persistent elevation over time predicting a poor outcome (8, 37, 54) . In addition, SARS-CoVinfected patients with poor outcome show deviated ISG and immunoglobulin gene expression early in infection and persistent chemokine levels (8) . Our data clearly showed that key inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u2424, IL-6, and TNF, were upregulated, with all responses being much more robust early during infection with the lethal isolates, in agreement with previous clinical studies (8, 54) . In support of this study, IL-1 receptor-deficient mice survived infection with a lethal mouseadapted SARS-CoV strain (49) , suggesting a role for IL-1\u2424 in SARS-CoV inflammation-induced pathogenesis. These inflammatory mediators have been shown to play an important role in the exudative phase of ARDS pathophysiology (43) . Interferon has also been suggested to play a role in ARDS pathophysiology, but what that role is has been less clear. Here, mouse interferon responses were increased early in lethal infection with a delayed response after nonlethal SARS-CoV infection. Previously, in vitro data have suggested that SARS-CoV infection blocks the interferon response through several mechanisms (15, 16, 29) , while in vivo data from humans, nonhuman primates, and mice have suggested that early SARS-CoV infection results in robust type I and II interferon responses, as well as increased ISG expression (3, 8, 12) . Studies of nonhuman primates at the cellular level bridge these results to show that cells infected with SARS-CoV cannot produce interferon but are capable of activating uninfected neighboring cells to produce an interferon response (12) .\r\n In addition to uncovering interferon signaling and components of an aberrant host response that contribute to lethality, mouse data also revealed differential gene expression in the complement cascade, as well as a novel regulatory network that could distinguish two lethal phenotypes. Complement activation has been shown to play a role in ARDS (22, 58) , as well as in the pathogenesis of other viruses, including arboviruses, dengue virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (2, 38, 40) . Studies regarding the involvement of the complement system in SARS-CoV pathogenesis are currently ongoing in our laboratory. Interestingly, gene expression analysis revealed a regulatory network made up of cell cycle, apoptosis, ER stress, and im-mune response genes working in concert to affect the progression of pathogenesis in aged animals. Both lethal phenotypes are associated with a strong regulation of immune pathways, including NF-B signaling and upregulation of IFN-\u2424 and translational-control\/ER stress pathways, including DNAJC3 (p58 IPK ). p58 IPK was previously shown to be a virulence factor during influenza infection (17) and could play a similar role during virus-induced ARDS. During viral infection, translational-control and cell cycle genes are expected to inhibit viral replication, and immune and apoptotic pathways kill infected cells. However, if this response occurs early in infected cells with strong upregulation of these genes, uninfected tissues can also suffer the effects of this uncontrolled immune response, similar to that seen in macaque studies (12) . Moreover, upregulation of apoptotic genes primes the cells for death rather than survival in a manner consistent with the two lethal phenotypes. In animals infected with icGZ02, a small number of apoptotic genes are upregulated at 24 h p.i., and this pattern is associated with the death of 75% of the mice by day 4. In contrast, infection with icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 causes upregulation of more apoptotic genes at 24 h p.i. and is associated with a 100% mortality rate by the end of day 3. Additional cell cycle regulation observed in icHC\/SZ\/61\/03-infected mice appears to be a result of increased lung damage. Klf6 expression was uniquely upregulated during lethal infection and has been linked to transforming growth factor beta-related repair of tissue damage (5) . Although this repair mechanism is activated by 24 h p.i., it is unable to counteract the inflammatory damage already under way. As a result, we describe the icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 host response as showing \"enhanced lethality\" due to the additional components of regulation identified in the lethalityassociated network.\r\n Although several other animal models of SARS-CoV infection have been described (12, 33, 36, 44, 45, 52) , these models rarely showed lethality. The results varied, ranging from asymptomatic virus replication to pulmonary pathology with visible clinical symptoms. The mouse models of virus-induced ARDS used in this study lead to clinical symptoms in mice and more accurately recapitulate the age-related pathogenic phenotype seen in human populations, suggesting this system is a relevant model to study the acute phase of SARS-CoV pathogenesis and virus-induced ARDS. The time course of our study was focused on the exudative phase of ARDS, characterized by DAD and hyaline membrane formation (47) , with a lethal outcome 3 to 4 days p.i.; therefore, mechanisms of fibrosis and tissue repair could not be determined. However, since several cytokines involved in fibrosis are induced in our model, we predict that the survival of lethally infected aged mice could be extended to the fibrotic phase of ARDS by using sublethal infection. How this time course extension would affect host response kinetics is of great interest. Future studies, using knockout mice and depletion studies, will investigate the roles of ARDS-associated cytokines, transforming growth factor beta-related repair mechanisms, complement cascades, cell cycle regulation, and caspase-directed apoptosis during acute virus infection with the goal of promoting normal tissue repair and inhibiting lethal disease in order to determine direct contributions to respiratory death. These studies, including comparative work with young and aged mice with low-and highly pathogenic influenza, may provide considerable insight into the effects of aging on early and\/or aberrant host response.\r\n In conclusion, the genomics data presented in this study have established two new models of virus-induced ARDS. These data provide several target cytokines that are associated with the development of ARDS and have identified several genes and pathways that potentially play roles in SARS-CoV pathogenesis. These genes and pathways will be valuable as candidates for future studies of the mechanism of SARS-CoV lethality and as potential targets for treatment. In addition, these new models of virus-induced ARDS will be invaluable for comparative analysis with other virus-induced ARDS models and may provide insight into common mechanisms of ARDS pathophysiology leading to death.","sha":"e658e1c8cf88661287431bcba3b880f663c0e32a","publish_time":"2009-05-06","authors":"Rockx, Barry; Baas, Tracey; Zornetzer, Gregory A.; Haagmans, Bart; Sheahan, Timothy; Frieman, Matthew; Dyer, Matthew D.; Teal, Thomas H.; Proll, Sean; van den Brand, Judith; Baric, Ralph; Katze, Michael G.","journal":"Journal of Virology","doi":"10.1128\/jvi.00127-09","Title":"Journal of Virology","H index":271.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a zoonotic pathogen, likely originating from bats, civets, and raccoon dogs, that entered the human population to cause a global epidemic in 2002 and 2003. Aging is associated with increased morbidity in a variety of viral infections (e.g., West Nile virus, influenza virus, SARS-CoV, and noroviruses), perhaps because the elderly respond poorly to new antigens compared to younger populations (41, 48) . Although the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV infection remain poorly defined, studies of a limited number of human serum (21, 24) and lung (7, 8, 20) samples have provided some insight. In addition, these patient samples are more likely to represent late-stage disease. All work was performed in a biological safety cabinet in a biosafety level 3 laboratory containing redundant exhaust fans. The weights of the mice were monitored daily. At 3, 12, 24, 48 , and 72 h postinfection (p.i.), four mice from each group were euthanized, and lung and serum samples were collected. 47) , mice were sacrificed through 72 h p.i. to ensure good-quality RNA for gene expression studies. All mice were housed under sterile conditions in individually ventilated Sealsafe cages using the Slim-Line system (Tecniplast, Exton, PA). Experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Lung samples were weighed and homogenized in five equivalent volumes of PBS to generate a 20% solution. Two days later, the plates were stained with neutral red and the plaques were counted. For detection of SARS-CoV antigen, serial sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and antigen was retrieved by incubating the sections at 100\u00b0C for 15 min with citric acid buffer, pH 6.0. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide. The slides were briefly washed with PBS\/0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with serum from ferrets infected with SARS-CoV (1\/400 in PBS\/0.1% bovine serum albumin) or normal ferret serum (1\/400) for 1 h at room temperature. Tissue sections from noninfected mice were used as negative controls. RNA isolation and genomic precharacterization. were characterized and judged to be pure and intact. The RNA samples were then tested by relative quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (described below) for the presence of the SARS-CoV N gene and cellular transcripts Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Irf7, and B2m to determine if individual samples could be pooled to generate one representative experimental sample to be used for gene expression analysis. Most samples had similar viral and cellular transcripts; therefore, equal-mass quantities of total RNA extracted from individual samples were pooled to create an experimental gene expression sample. showed considerable variation in viral transcripts, with only one out of four young mice and three out of four aged mice with detectable viral transcripts; therefore, a different pooling strategy was used. cRNA probes were generated from each pooled RNA sample using the Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Each pooled experimental RNA sample was then cohybridized with its corresponding reference sample, i.e., young experimental mice versus young mock-infected mice and aged experimental mice versus aged mock-infected mice. Each microarray experiment was done with four technical replicates, two with reverse dye hybridization (28) . A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (53) was used to identify sets of genes annotated by the same function in the gene ontology (GO) (1) that were differentially expressed during infection. In preparation for this analysis, the Rosetta Resolver System was used to determine the P value of the differential expression of each gene compared to the mock sample. For every function in GO, a GSEA was applied to each virus\/time point combination. Relative quantitative real-time RT-PCR was run on the ABI 7500 PCR system, using TaqMan chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 1B) and exhibited clinical symptoms, including hunching, ruffled fur, and labored breathing. Differences in clinical outcomes did not correlate with differences in viral replication efficiencies. Weight changes are expressed as the mean percent changes for infected animals relative to the initial weights at day zero. Lung tissues were harvested from infected mice at 3, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h p.i. and assayed for infectious virus as described in Materials and Methods. Tissue samples from five mice were analyzed at each time point. The error bars represent standard deviations. for icGZ02 and icHC\/SZ\/61\/03, after which icGZ02 titers dropped while icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 titers remained consistent. While clear differences in clinical outcomes were observed between nonlethal icUrbani and lethal icGZ02 and icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 isolates, these differences could not be attributed to virus growth efficiencies in the lungs of infected aged mice, suggesting that intrinsic properties of the S glycoprotein contributed to differences in pathogenesis. S glycoproteins affect the tropism of SARS-CoV replication in lungs of infected mice. Using polyclonal ferret sera directed against the SARS-CoV N protein, unique patterns of viral N protein distribution were clearly detectable in the lungs of all infected young and aged mice by 24 h p.i. ( viral N protein expression was localized in a moderate number of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells and a few scattered alveolar epithelial cells, again with morphology consistent with type II pneumocytes. Pulmonary gene expression comparison in young and aged mice infected with nonlethal and lethal SARS-CoV strains provides an opportunity to identify unique expression signatures associated with lethal infection that could reveal the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV pathogenesis. In young mice, a late response to SARS-CoV infection was observed at 72 h p.i., In aged mice, a greater number of genes were differentially expressed during infection with lethal SARS-CoV isolates than with the nonle- thal isolate, with the lethal icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 strain inducing greater numbers (\u03f3200 more) of genes at 24 and 72 h p.i. Both of these graphical formats showed that the response at 24 h is an important determinant of the disease outcome due to an aberrant host response. Host response at 24 h after lethal infection. In addition, upon SARS-CoV infection in either young or aged mice, both beta interferon (IFN-\u2424) and IFN-\u2425, but not IFN-\u2423, were significantly upregulated, as previously observed in other animal models of SARS-CoV infection (3, 12) . in aged mice infected with icGZ02 and icHC\/SZ\/61\/03, but these same responses during nonlethal icUrbani infection were delayed until 72 h p.i. In order to assess the host response differences between the two lethal SARS-CoV strains, which could be on March 20, 2020 by guest http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/ Downloaded from potential determinants of disease outcome, a gene interaction network was created, associated with early host response (24 h p.i.). The interaction network shows the four broad functional classes of immune response, apoptosis, cell cycle control, and translational control\/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, acting in concert and shows that icGZ02 infection regulates a subset of the genes whereas icHC\/SZ\/61\/03 infection regulates all of the genes in the network. Despite intensive studies, there are currently no specific therapies for ARDS, especially following virus infection, and model systems are desperately needed. It has been shown that mutations in the S glycoprotein are responsible for differences in receptor affinity during adaptation (34) . Our observation that downregulation of ACE2 correlates with lethality agrees with earlier studies showing that SARS-CoV S glycoprotein worsens acute lung failure in mice (32) . Canonical pathway regulation correlates with pathogenesis and lethality. the top canonical pathways associated with lethal infections of aged mice (the significance criteria were \u03fe1.5-fold change with a P value of \u03fd0.01) are interferon signaling (P \u03ed 2.75 \u03eb 10 \u03ea14 for HC\/SZ\/61\/03 and P \u03ed 4.75 \u03eb 10 \u03ea14 for GZ02) and acute-phase response (P \u03ed 1.62 \u03eb 10 \u03ea9 for HC\/SZ\/61\/03 and P \u03ed 5.2 \u03eb 10 \u03ea9 for GZ02). The \"NM\" numbers on the right are GenBank accession numbers. upregulation of genes associated with apoptosis and tissue injury (25) . This is in agreement with the observation that p.i. common patterns of regulation occurred regardless of the disease outcome. Previously, in vitro data have suggested that SARS-CoV infection blocks the interferon response through several mechanisms (15, 16, 29) , while in vivo data from humans, nonhuman primates, and mice have suggested that early SARS-CoV infection results in robust type I and II interferon responses, as well as increased ISG expression (3, 8, 12) . and is associated with a 100% mortality rate by the end of day 3. Future studies, using knockout mice and depletion studies, will investigate the roles of ARDS-associated cytokines, transforming growth factor beta-related repair mechanisms, complement cascades, cell cycle regulation, and caspase-directed apoptosis during acute virus infection with the goal of promoting normal tissue repair and inhibiting lethal disease in order to determine direct contributions to respiratory death."},{"Unnamed: 0":23,"Unnamed: 0.1":23,"doc_id":"38e90ac6ed74a02c089a7b6445a966c59851f5a8","title":"High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation for Adult Patients With ARDS*","abstract":"High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is characterized by the rapid delivery of small tidal volumes (VTs) of gas and the application of high mean airway pressures (mPaws).

High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) was shown to be no better than CMV in maintaining oxygenation and ventilation in adult patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. 4 In premature neonates with respiratory distress syndrome, there was an excess of adverse events in two trials, 5, 6 with one using HFJV and one using high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). These early studies were criticized because of issues with trial design and the inconsistent use of lung recruitment strategies. 7 Many lessons were learned from these early studies, including problems with the introduction of a new technology before adequately understanding the physiologic principles and its optimal application. 8 Over the past few years, perhaps as a result of the understanding that conventional ventilatory approaches to lung protection can save lives, 9 there has been renewed interest in HFV. Most of the more recent advances have been in the utilization of HFOV in adult patients with ALI and ARDS. This article will focus on animal studies from the past few years, which have advanced our understanding of HFOV as it is applied to models of ALI\/ARDS, and on more recent clinical studies in adult patients with ALI\/ARDS.\r\n Currently, there are three modes of HFV in clinical use, as follows: HFJV; high-frequency percussive ventilation; and HFOV. We will limit this review to HFOV. Detailed descriptions of the other high-frequency modes can be found elsewhere. 3, 10 During HFOV in adults, a piston pump oscillates at frequencies between 180 and 600 breaths\/min (3 to 10 Hz) [Fig 2] . 10 An inspiratory bias flow of fresh gas (30 to 60 L\/min) and a resistance valve in the circuit are used to control the mPaw within the circuit. HFOV is unique compared to other modes of HFV, as the return stroke of the piston during expiration leads to the active expiration of gas. 11 Arguably, this active expiration allows for less gas trapping. Humidification during HFOV is achieved by passing the bias flow of gas through a humidifier.\r\n The other unique feature of HFOV is the ability to, for the most part, separate the control of oxygenation and ventilation. Oxygenation is primarily a function of the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio 2 ) and mPaw (or lung volume). Ventilation is inversely related to the respiratory frequency and is directly related to the excursion of the diaphragm of the ventilator, with the latter expressed as the pressure amplitude (\u232cP) of oscillation. 12\r\n During CMV, gas transport occurs by bulk delivery of gas due to convection through the airways to the alveolar zones. Since a certain proportion of the delivered Vt remains in the proximal airways as dead space volume, the Vt must be more than the dead space volume for gas exchange to occur. Because Vts delivered with HFV are usually less than the anatomic dead space, this traditional concept of gas transport does not apply. Gas transport is thought to occur via a number of convective and diffusive mechanisms (Fig 3) . 13 These include the bulk flow of gas to alveolar units close to the proximal airways, asymmetric velocity profiles, and Taylor dispersion. The latter two mechanisms are related to augmented Figure 1 . Schematic representation of the purported waveforms of HFOV and conventional pressure-controlled ventilation in the distal airways. The large pressure swings present in the proximal circuit during HFOV (perhaps up to twice the mean airway pressure, depending on the set \u232cP) are significantly attenuated in the distal airways. The degree of attenuation is dependent on frequency, ETT size, and inspiratory\/expiratory time ratio. mixing of gas within the airways because of the high energies involved during HFV. In addition, there is asynchronous filling of adjacent alveolar spaces (termed pendelluft) due to different alveolar-emptying times, collateral ventilation through nonairway connections between neighboring alveoli, and cardiogenic mixing. To further understand these mechanisms, the reader is encouraged to refer to several excellent reviews. 3, 10, 14, 15 Experimental Studies of HFOV in ALI \/ARDS It is now known that CMV can be injurious to the lung through mechanisms such as barotrauma, volutrauma, and atelectrauma, 16 Collectively, these mechanisms are called ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). A lung-protective ventilator strategy that reduces alveolar overdistension (ie, volutrauma) has been shown to reduce mortality in ALI\/ARDS patients. 9 HFOV may be an ideal lung-protective ventilatory mode by virtue of the comparatively higher mPaws achieved, thus allowing for better lung recruitment and very low Vts.\r\n HFOV utilizes an oscillating diaphragm at high frequencies to create pressure swings within the airway, which leads to CO 2 elimination. Vts generated during HFOV are proportional to the \u232cP and the inspiratory\/expiratory ratio, and are inversely proportional to respiratory frequency. The use of high flows of gas, coupled with the resistance of the endotracheal tube (ETT), leads to significant attenuation of these pressure oscillations in the distal airway. 17, 18 Consequently, it was assumed that the alveolar Vts generated are lower than those on CMV and, hence, are associated with less alveolar overdistension. However, a few recent studies have challenged this assumption.\r\n First, this assumption was based on small animal models and the neonatal literature, in which very high frequencies (ie, \u03fe 10Hz) and lower \u232cPs are employed. In adult patients, relatively lower frequencies (ie, 3 to 6 Hz) and higher \u232cPs (ie, 60 to 90 cm H 2 O) are often needed to achieve CO 2 elimination. In a 2003 study 19 of lung injury in an adult sheep model, HFOV at settings similar to those applied in adults delivered Vts that were much higher than originally thought. For example, Sedeek et al 19 applied HFOV with an inspiratory\/expiratory ratio of 1:1, 60 cm H 2 O \u232cP, and a frequency of 4 Hz, and observed actual Vts of 4.4 mL\/kilogram. Second, as the inner diameter of the ETT increases, so does the inspiratory Vt. In a preterm lamb-based computer model, 18 reducing the internal diameter of the ETT from 4.0 to 2.5 mm halved the transmission of the pressure waveform to both the carina and the alveolar compartment. These findings have significant implications as adult patients have larger ETTs and require lower frequencies compared to neonates. Hence, if larger Vts are generated, this mode of ventilation may not be as safe as originally thought. A recent preliminary clinical study of seven adults with ARDS by Hager et al, 20 published in abstract form, was reassuring in that measured Vts while patients received HFOV ranged from 44 to 209 mL, which was substantially lower than the Vts commonly used in CMV.\r\n The small pressure swings produced during HFOV allow for higher mPaws without injurious levels of peak airway pressure. This leads to better lung recruitment and a higher end-expiratory lung volume. The combined effects of higher mPaws and very small pressure oscillations lead to less cyclical recruitment-derecruitment of the lung. 21 Conversely, the much larger pressure swings seen during CMV, despite similar levels of mPaw, may lead to cyclical alveolar collapse at end-expiration. 22 Setting the mPaw for optimal lung recruitment, however, remains challenging. Typically, it has been recommended that clinicians initiate HFOV with an mPaw that is 3 to 5 cm H 2 O higher than the mPaw used during CMV. Using a sheep model of lung injury and calculating the static pressure-volume curves while using CMV, Goddon et al 23 found that an mPaw 6 cm H 2 O above the lower inflection point yielded the best Pao 2 \/Fio 2 ratio. It was notable that this pressure correlated with the point of maximum curvature on the deflation limb of the pressurevolume curve. In a similar experiment utilizing CT scans to estimate lung recruitment and lung volumes, Luecke et al 24 found that the ideal mPaw was 1.5 times the lower inflection point, which also corresponded to the ideal mPaw in the study by Goddon et al. 23 At this level of mPaw, the best gas exchange was achieved without compromising cardiac output (CO). Unfortunately, neither of these strategies is practical or clinically applicable for most intensivists.\r\n Many investigators have thus hypothesized that the mechanical advantages of HFOV should lead to a lower incidence of VILI. Experiments in small animals 21 seem to support this hypothesis, demonstrating less histologic damage and lung inflammation. In saline solution-lavaged rabbit models of lung injury, 21,25-27 HFOV has been found to reduce the morphologic findings of VILI, including hyaline membrane formation, alveolar leukocyte infiltration, and airway epithelial damage when compared to CMV. In addition, the expression of messenger RNA for tumor necrosis factor, several interleukins (ILs) [ie, IL-1\u2424, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10], transforming growth factor, and adhesion molecules were all reduced in animals receiving HFOV.\r\n Most of the earlier animal studies comparing HFOV and CMV utilized relatively high peak inspiratory pressures and Vts. Whether or not HFOV compares favorably to CMV applied with a \"lungprotective\" strategy (ie, low Vt and high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]) has been the subject of several investigations. 25,28 -30 Imai et al 25 compared pathophysiologic and biochemical markers in a saline solution-lavaged rabbit model of ARDS treated with the following four different ventilatory strategies: (1) CMV with moderate Vts (10 to 12 mL\/kg); (2) CMV with low Vts (5 to 6 mL\/kg) and PEEPs 2 to 3 cm H 2 O higher than the lower inflection point; (3) CMV with low Vts and PEEPs of 8 to 10 cm H 2 O; and (4) HFOV. Rabbits treated with HFOV had less neutrophil infiltration, lower levels of tumor necrosis factor, and decreased pathologic changes in the alveolar spaces when compared to the other groups of rabbits. In contrast, Vasquez de Anda et al 28 found no difference in lung mechanics and protein concentration in BAL fluid samples when comparing HFOV to pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) applied with high levels of PEEP in a rat model of ARDS. Compared with small animals, HFOV applied to adults with larger ETTs may lead to larger pressure swings and greater Vts. Unfortunately, there are currently few large animal studies of HFOV and ALI. [31] [32] [33] [34] One study from 2003 33 compared PCV, HFOV, and intratracheal percussive ventilation in a sheep model of lung injury. The investigators found greater histologic damage in the PCV group, which was ventilated with relatively high Vts (8 mL\/kg). Overall, more large animal studies are needed to compare HFOV and lung-protective CMV.\r\n With ARDS Table 1 presents a summary of case series and randomized trials evaluating HFOV in adults. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [45] [46] [47] [48] 50, 51, 63, 64 The first study of HFOV in adults with ARDS was published in 1997. 35 This single-center study described the use of HFOV in 17 adult patients with ARDS, mainly due to sepsis and pneumonia, who were not responding to CMV. The patients had a mean Pao 2 \/Fio 2 ratio of 68 mm Hg, an oxygenation index (OI) [Fio 2 \u03eb mPaw \u03eb 100\/Pao 2 ] of 48, and an APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II score of 23. All of the patients showed improvement in the OI with HFOV, and the overall survival rate was 47%. Of note, these authors observed that nonsurvivors had received CMV for a significantly longer duration prior to receiving HFOV than survivors. This finding suggests that HFOV may be more effective when initiated earlier in the course of ARDS. An alternate point of view is that patients in whom ARDS develops later in their ICU stay (and thus are candidates for an HFOV trial at a later time point) may have a poorer outcome, regardless of whether HFOV is used or not.\r\n Subsequent to this study, a number of other groups published their experience with HFOV. 36 -41 These were generally small case series (range, 5 to 42 cases), in which patients had severe ARDS and HFOV was employed as rescue therapy. 9, 42, 43 While all of these studies showed that the application of HFOV was associated with improvements in oxygenation compared with baseline during CMV, survival was generally poor. As with other studies in patients with ARDS, 44 only a minority of patients treated with HFOV died due to respiratory failure. In adult patients with ARDS, only two prospective, randomized trials 45, 46 have been published comparing HFOV with CMV. In a study by Derdak et al, 45 148 adults in 13 centers were randomized to receive either HFOV or CMV. At baseline, patients in both groups were well-matched, with a mean age of 49.5 years, an APACHE II score of 22, and similar Pao 2 \/Fio 2 ratios (approximately 110). The main findings of this study were as follows: (1) an earlier improvement in the Pao 2 \/Fio 2 ratio (\u03fd 16 h) in the HFOV group, which did not persist beyond 24 h; and (2) a similar but low incidence of adverse events in both groups (intractable hypotension, 0 to 3%; air leak, 9 to 12%; mucus-plugging of ETT, 4 to 5%). The study was also notable for a nonsignificant trend toward a lower 30-day mortality rate in the HFOV group compared to that in the group receiving conventional ventilation (37% vs 52%, respectively; p \u03ed 0.102). As this study was performed before the publication of the first ARDS Network trial, 9 relatively large Vts (10 mL\/kg) with high peak inspiratory pressures were used, which has been a major criticism of this study.\r\n The second randomized controlled trial (RCT) was stopped prematurely for slow enrollment after randomizing 61 patients to HFOV or CMV. 46 A trend toward a higher ICU mortality rate in the HFOV group (43% vs 33%, respectively; p \u03ed 0.59) was found. However, interpretation of this study is limited because of the small number of patients enrolled, the baseline differences in the two groups (including a higher OI in the HFOV group), the lack of explicit ventilation protocols, and the crossover of 18% of patients to the alternate arm.\r\n Improvement in oxygenation in patients receiving HFOV can be slow, taking up to 8 h in one study. 37 This is a consequence of the small Vts that are used, leading to very little tidal recruitment. The use of recruitment maneuvers (RMs) may increase or hasten alveolar recruitment. A multicenter, observational pilot study 47 ARDS, RMs applied at the commencement of HFOV resulted in early and significant improvements in Pao 2 \/Fio 2 ratio compared to standardized CMV (200 vs 92 mm Hg, respectively, within 1.5 h). The improvement in oxygenation occurred more rapidly than has been reported in other HFOV studies. 35, 37, 45 The RMs were relatively safe, and only 8 of 244 RMs (3.3%) were aborted, mainly because of hypotension. If adults with ARDS remain hypoxemic during HFOV, prone positioning and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) may further improve gas exchange. 48, 49 In a study of 23 adults with ARDS, Mehta et al 48 administered iNO at 5 to 20 ppm during HFOV and observed that the mean Pao 2 \/Fio 2 ratio increased by 38% at 30 min. In addition, 83% of patients had a significant improvement in oxygenation in response to iNO, which is greater than the response observed in most studies applying iNO during CMV. 48 Papazian and colleagues compared the impact of supine HFOV, prone HFOV, and prone CMV on 12-h oxygenation in 39 patients with ARDS. 50 While both groups of prone patients (ie, CMV and HFOV groups) had similar and significant improvements in oxygenation, the supine HFOV group showed no improvement. This was a surprising finding given that all previous studies 35, 37, 51 have shown improvements in oxygenation with HFOV. The most likely explanation for this difference is that insufficient airway pressures (average mPaw, 25 cm H 2 O) were applied during HFOV in this study. Thus, the improvement in oxygenation in the prone HFOV group likely reflects the effect of the change in position only, and not the combined effect of the two modalities. Furthermore, the 12-h observation period may have been insufficient for maximal HFOV-induced lung recruitment, as other studies 35, 45 have shown that the maximal improvement in oxygenation occurs beyond 12 h.\r\n Many of the clinical studies 35, 37, 40, 51 have demonstrated that the delayed initiation of HFOV is an independent predictor of death. In addition, an RCT comparing HFOV and CMV demonstrated a trend toward lower mortality in the HFOV group. 45 These observations are consistent with findings in animal models of ALI, which have shown that prolonged exposure to excessive Vts and insufficient PEEP can further exacerbate the lung injury, [52] [53] [54] can increase the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and potentially can promote the development of multiorgan failure and death. 43, 55 A recent systematic review 56 of the determinants of mortality with the use of HFOV in adults with ARDS also found a 20% higher mortality rate for every additional day CMV was received. However, this association was confounded by differences in pH (pH adjusted: relative risk, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 1.46).\r\n There is a need to compare HFOV and the best available lung-protective CMV with adequate power and with mortality as the primary outcome. With better understanding of VILI, and the use of lungprotective ventilatory strategies, mortality from ARDS has been decreasing over the past decade. 9, 44, 57 As a result, the choice of a conventional strategy is important. In a recently published trial 57 conducted by the ARDS Network, two fluid management strategies (liberal and conservative) were compared in the management of established ALI. In both study arms, a lung-protective ventilation protocol with low Vts and limited plateau pressures were used. The 60-day mortality rates were 28.4% and 25.5%, respectively, which is one of the lowest mortality rates in large, published trials of ALI\/ ARDS. Whether or not HFOV as a lung-protective ventilatory mode would be able to reduce mortality beyond what has already been achieved with CMV is uncertain.\r\n Because of the higher mPaws that are applied during HFOV, potential concerns include barotrauma and hemodynamic compromise. In a retrospective study by Mehta et al, 51 26% of 156 patients had HFOV discontinued because of difficulties with oxygenation, ventilation, or hemodynamics, and the incidence of pneumothorax was 21.8%. However, in the two RCTs 12,46 of HFOV vs CMV that have been published so far, the incidence of pneumothorax and hypotension were comparable between the two groups. In the Treatment with Oscillation and an Open Lung Strategy pilot study, 47 which applied repeated RMs as part of an aggressive lung recruitment strategy, only 1 patient (of 25) required withdrawal from HFOV for barotrauma. Two patients (8%) required a chest tube insertion for barotrauma, and eight RMs (of 244; 3.3%) were aborted because of hypotension. Recognition of a pneumothorax is a particular challenge in patients receiving HFOV. The background noise of the ventilator, coupled with the lack of true breath sounds due to minimal bulk flow, makes the detection of a pneumothorax by auscultation difficult. Often, reduction or asymmetry in the body wiggle, in response to the pressure waves, or a rise in \u232cP are clues that such an event has occurred.\r\n The application of HFOV has been associated with increases in central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP), and with a small, clinically insignificant decrease in CO. 37, 45, 51, 58 In the randomized trial by Derdak et al, 45 the CVP increased from 14 mm Hg at baseline to 16 mm Hg at 2 h. The corresponding values for the PAOP were 16 and 18 mm Hg, respectively; and for the CO, 7.4 and 7.0 L\/min, respectively. In another study by David et al, 58 similar findings were obtained. In addition, the stroke volume index, and the end-systolic and diastolic area indexes decreased. The increases in CVP and PAOP likely reflected the increased mPaw, while the decreased CO and crosssectional area of the left ventricle were likely due to a decrease in venous return.\r\n Therefore, it is important that patients transitioning from CMV to HFOV are adequately volume repleted; judicious fluid challenges may be necessary to prevent or ameliorate the hemodynamic effects of higher mPaws. The extent to which this additional fluid may be detrimental is uncertain. However, given the recent data 57 implicating more aggressive fluid strategies in longer ICU stays and ventilator times, this needs to be done with caution and evaluated carefully.\r\n Adequate humidification is important, because of the high gas flows and minute ventilation. With HFOV, the desiccation of secretions could potentially lead to mucus inspissation and ETT obstruction, 12 although the incidence of this complication is relatively low (4 to 5%). 35, 37 Very heavy sedation to induce apnea is often needed, as most patients are intolerant of the technique. The continuous use of IV sedation has been associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU and hospital length of stays. 59, 60 In addition, neuromuscular blocking agents, medications that have been implicated in the development of critical illness polyneuropathy, 61 are usually necessary. 51 One other concern with HFOV is the lack of an approved expiratory filter for the device, potentially leading to aerosolization of infectious droplets. During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Toronto, HFOV was grouped as a high-risk respiratory procedure (together with noninvasive ventilation, intubation, and nebulized therapies) precisely because of this issue. 62 In summary, HFOV has been shown to lead to improvements in oxygenation in adult patients with ARDS, particularly in those not responding to CMV, with complication rates that are similar to those patients receiving CMV. Previous studies have suggested that the earlier application of HFOV in adult patients with ARDS may lead to lower mortality when compared to CMV. Currently, the practice in our institution is to consider using HFOV once lung-protective ventilation with CMV is no longer possible (ie, an inability to adequately oxygenate or ventilate the patient while maintaining a plateau pressure of \u03fd 30 cm H 2 O and an Fio 2 of \u03fd 0.6). These thresholds may be lower than what most clinicians would consider to be the \"failure\" of CMV. Table 2 shows the initiation settings for HFOV at our institution. We also favor RMs during the initiation of HFOV to accelerate lung recruitment. The reader should be aware that RMs are relatively contraindicated if there is significant barotrauma. In addition, because of the high mPaws used and the need for rapid alveolar emptying, HFOV is relatively contraindicated in patients with severe obstructive lung disease or asthma. Currently, a well-validated and standardized algorithm does not exist, and there are variations between institutions on many aspects, including mPaw titration protocol, the routine use of ETT cuff leaks to enhance CO 2 clearance, RMs, weaning, transition back to CMV, and the use of other adjuncts (such as prone positioning and iNO).\r\n Over the past decade, our understanding of HFOV and how it relates to VILI has increased substantially. Small animal studies have indeed shown that HFOV may attenuate VILI. However, in order to extrapolate these results to adult patients with ARDS, studies using large animal models of lung injury are needed.\r\n Although it is emerging in mainstream clinical use in adult patients, HFOV remains a unique mode of ventilation with different gas exchange principles compared to those for CMV. As with other new technologies in the ICU, clinicians and administrators of individual institutions need to study the added cost of training staff and the safety issues surrounding a mode of mechanical ventilation that may be infrequently utilized. In addition, more clinical studies of HFOV are needed to address the many unanswered questions regarding the use of HFOV in adult patients with ARDS. What are the optimal timing, patient selection, and technique to be used? How do we optimally recruit the lung and measure this at the bedside? And finally, given the substantial mortality reductions with current CMV-based lungprotective strategies, HFOV needs to be compared directly with CMV in a large RCT with mortality as the primary outcome measure.","sha":"38e90ac6ed74a02c089a7b6445a966c59851f5a8","publish_time":"2007-06-30","authors":"Chan, Kenneth P.W.; Stewart, Thomas E.; Mehta, Sangeeta","journal":"Chest","doi":"10.1378\/chest.06-1549","Title":"Chest","H index":267.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"tics make HFV conceptually attractive as a lungprotective ventilatory mode. 4 In premature neonates with respiratory distress syndrome, there was an excess of adverse events in two trials, 5, 6 with one using HFJV and one using high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). Most of the more recent advances have been in the utilization of HFOV in adult patients with ALI and ARDS. Detailed descriptions of the other high-frequency modes can be found elsewhere. 10 An inspiratory bias flow of fresh gas (30 to 60 L\/min) and a resistance valve in the circuit are used to control the mPaw within the circuit. The other unique feature of HFOV is the ability to, for the most part, separate the control of oxygenation and ventilation. Oxygenation is primarily a function of the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio 2 ) and mPaw (or lung volume). Gas transport is thought to occur via a number of convective and diffusive mechanisms (Fig 3) . The latter two mechanisms are related to augmented Figure 1 . The degree of attenuation is dependent on frequency, ETT size, and inspiratory\/expiratory time ratio. mixing of gas within the airways because of the high energies involved during HFV. In addition, there is asynchronous filling of adjacent alveolar spaces (termed pendelluft) due to different alveolar-emptying times, collateral ventilation through nonairway connections between neighboring alveoli, and cardiogenic mixing. For example, Sedeek et al 19 applied HFOV with an inspiratory\/expiratory ratio of 1:1, 60 cm H 2 O \u232cP, and a frequency of 4 Hz, and observed actual Vts of 4.4 mL\/kilogram. A recent preliminary clinical study of seven adults with ARDS by Hager et al, 20 published in abstract form, was reassuring in that measured Vts while patients received HFOV ranged from 44 to 209 mL, which was substantially lower than the Vts commonly used in CMV. This leads to better lung recruitment and a higher end-expiratory lung volume. 21 Conversely, the much larger pressure swings seen during CMV, despite similar levels of mPaw, may lead to cyclical alveolar collapse at end-expiration. Many investigators have thus hypothesized that the mechanical advantages of HFOV should lead to a lower incidence of VILI. In addition, the expression of messenger RNA for tumor necrosis factor, several interleukins (ILs) [ie, IL-1\u2424, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10], transforming growth factor, and adhesion molecules were all reduced in animals receiving HFOV. In contrast, Vasquez de Anda et al 28 found no difference in lung mechanics and protein concentration in BAL fluid samples when comparing HFOV to pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) applied with high levels of PEEP in a rat model of ARDS. Overall, more large animal studies are needed to compare HFOV and lung-protective CMV. 35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [45] [46] [47] [48] 50, 51, 63, 64 The first study of HFOV in adults with ARDS was published in 1997. Subsequent to this study, a number of other groups published their experience with HFOV. 9, 42, 43 While all of these studies showed that the application of HFOV was associated with improvements in oxygenation compared with baseline during CMV, survival was generally poor. In a study by Derdak et al, 45 148 adults in 13 centers were randomized to receive either HFOV or CMV. The study was also notable for a nonsignificant trend toward a lower 30-day mortality rate in the HFOV group compared to that in the group receiving conventional ventilation (37% vs 52%, respectively; p \u03ed 0.102). The second randomized controlled trial (RCT) was stopped prematurely for slow enrollment after randomizing 61 patients to HFOV or CMV. A multicenter, observational pilot study 47 ARDS, RMs applied at the commencement of HFOV resulted in early and significant improvements in Pao 2 \/Fio 2 ratio compared to standardized CMV (200 vs 92 mm Hg, respectively, within 1.5 h). 48 Papazian and colleagues compared the impact of supine HFOV, prone HFOV, and prone CMV on 12-h oxygenation in 39 patients with ARDS. This was a surprising finding given that all previous studies 35, 37, 51 have shown improvements in oxygenation with HFOV. In a retrospective study by Mehta et al, 51 26% of 156 patients had HFOV discontinued because of difficulties with oxygenation, ventilation, or hemodynamics, and the incidence of pneumothorax was 21.8%. In another study by David et al, 58 similar findings were obtained. In addition, the stroke volume index, and the end-systolic and diastolic area indexes decreased. The extent to which this additional fluid may be detrimental is uncertain. Adequate humidification is important, because of the high gas flows and minute ventilation.

Methods: We evaluated survivors with confirmed SARS at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, at 3, 6, and 12 months after symptom onset. Our assessment included: lung volume (total lung capacity [TLC], vital capacity, residual volume, functional residual capacity), spirometry (FVC, FEV 1 ), diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), inspiratory and expiratory respiratory muscle strength, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), chest radiographs (CXRs), and HRQoL by Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey questionnaire. Results: Ninety-seven patients completed the serial assessments. There were 39 male and 58 female patients, and 63 patients (70%) were health-care workers (mean age, 36.9 years [SD, 9.5 years]; body mass index, 23.7 kg\/m 2 [SD, 4.0 kg\/m 2 ]). At 1 year, 27 patients (27.8%) had abnormal CXR findings. Four patients (4.1%), 5 patients (5.2%), and 23 patients (23.7%) had FVC, TLC, and DLCO values < 80% of predicted values, respectively. The 6MWD at 12 months was 511.0 m (SD, 89.8 m), which was higher than at 3 months (mean difference, 47.0 m; 95% confidence interval [CI], 31.8 to 62.1 m; p < 0.01) but not different from 6 months (mean difference, 9.7 m; 95% CI, \u060a 4.4 to 23.8 m; p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.18). The 6MWD was lower than that for normal control subjects of the same age groups, and there was impairment of HRQoL at 12 months. Patients who required ICU admission (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 31) showed higher CXR scores (1.6 [SD, 3.1]; vs 0.4 [SD, 1.1]; p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.04) and lower percentage of predicted FVC, TLC, and DLCO than those who did not, but there were no differences in 6MWD and health status. Conclusion: Significant impairment in DLCO was noted in 23.7% of survivors 1 year after illness onset. Exercise capacity and health status of SARS survivors were remarkably lower than those of a normal population.

Previous studies on survivors of acute lung injury 11 and ARDS [12] [13] [14] [15] unrelated to SARS have shown variable degrees of residual abnormalities in pulmonary function, exercise capacity, and impairment in healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL).\r\n We have recently reported that 15.5% of our SARS survivors (n \u03ed 110) had abnormal diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) at 6 months, whereas overall their exercise capacity and health status were lower than normal populations of the same age groups. 16 We report herein the 1-year outcome of a prospective follow-up study of the same SARS patient cohort, which was epidemiologically linked to a single index case during a major hospital outbreak in 2003. 7, 17 We examined serial lung function, exercise capacity, chest radiographs (CXRs), and HRQoL at 3, 6, and 12 months after the onset of illness. In addition, we compared SARS survivors who required ICU admissions to those who were treated on the medical wards with reference to the same outcome parameters.\r\n This is a prospective, longitudinal, follow-up study of patients with SARS discharged from our hospital after surviving the major outbreak in 2003. The patients came from our previously reported cohort 7 recruited over a period of 2 weeks from March 11 to March 25, 2003 . The diagnosis of SARS was based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria at the time. 18 All patients in this study had subsequent laboratory confirmation of SARS. 19 Treatment and outcome of these patients during hospitalization have been reported in detail elsewhere. 19 This prospective outcome study of SARS survivors was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\r\n Following discharge from the hospital, patients were evaluated in the lung function laboratory at the end of 3, 6, and 12 months after disease onset. During the visit, subjects were interviewed and underwent a physical examination, pulmonary function testing, respiratory muscle strength measurement, posteroanterior CXR, resting oximetry, and a standardized 6-min walk test (6MWT). 20, 21 In addition, they completed the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) to measure HRQoL. 22 6MWT: The 6MWT provides a standardized, objective, integrated assessment of cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal function that is relevant to daily activities. 20, 21 The self-paced 6MWT assesses the submaximal level of functional capacity 21 and has been applied in a long-term follow-up study 12 of survivors of ARDS. The 6-min walk distances (6MWDs) were compared to normative reference data collected from a population survey of 538 normal healthy subjects in 2004 by the Coordinating Committee in Physiotherapy, Hong Kong Hospital Authority, on 2 separate days. The 6MWDs of the control subjects (n \u03ed 538) on day 1 and day 2 of assessment were 598.4 m (SD, 98.7 m) and 609.2 m (SD, 100.4 m), respectively, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 0.89); SE of measurement, 35.3; minimum detectable change, 97.8 m; and limit of agreement, 10.8 (95% CI, \u03ea 87.1 to 108.6). The 6MWD data stratified into different age groups are available for comparison with the SARS patients, although we have no access to individual data of this population survey.\r\n SF-36: The SF-36 includes eight multiple-item domains that assess physical functioning (PF), social functioning (SF), role limitation due to physical problems (RP), role limitation due to emotional problem (RE), mental health (MH), bodily pain (BP), vitality (VT), and general health (GH). 22 Scores for each aspect can range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) with higher scores indicating better HRQoL. The validated Chinese (Hong Kong [HK]) version of the SF-36 23 was applied for this study, and the results were compared to the HK normative data collected from a random telephone survey 24 , and surface area for gas exchange (Dlco adjusted for hemoglobin, and Dlco adjusted for alveolar volume [Kco]) were performed (Vmax System; SensorMedics; Yorba Linda, CA). Dlco was determined by the single-breath technique using an infrared analyzer. We per-formed spirometry (FEV 1 and FVC) according to the standards of the American Thoracic Society. 25, 26 The results were compared to the normative data, 27 which have been widely adopted as the reference data in HK.\r\n Measurement of the maximum static inspiratory pressure (Pimax) that a subject can generate at the mouth or the maximum static expiratory pressure (Pemax) is a simple way to gauge inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength. 28, 29 Since respiratory muscle weakness may lead to a restrictive pattern on lung function testing, Pimax and Pemax were assessed with a mouth pressure meter via a flanged mouthpiece 30 after full lung function testing. In a study of 24 normal subjects (23 Chinese and 1 Indian; mean age, 29.2 years) in Singapore, the maximal static inspiratory effort from RV for the group was 83.5 cm H 2 O (SD, 35.5 cm H 2 O). 31 A Pimax of \u03ea 80 cm H 2 O and a Pemax of \u03e9 80 cm H 2 O generally exclude clinically significant weakness of the inspiratory and expiratory muscles, respectively. 32 Radiographic Assessment: Frontal CXRs were performed at 3, 6, and 12 months using standardized techniques with computed radiography equipment as we have reported during the major hospital outbreak. 7 The images were assessed using a picture archive communications system (MagicView VA22E; Siemens; Erlangen, Germany) and viewer (model 2K; Siemens). Each lung was divided into three zones (upper, middle, and lower) on frontal radiography. The observers assessed the presence, appearances (airspace opacities or reticular opacities), distribution, and size of lung parenchymal abnormalities on each CXR of all patients. The size of the lesion was assessed by visually estimating the percentage of area occupied in each zone on each side. The overall percentage of involvement was obtained by averaging the percentage of involvement of the six lung zones. The frontal CXR closest to the date of the lung function test was assessed by two radiologists, both of whom were blinded to the clinical information. The findings were reached by consensus. The assessment method was described in our previous study. 33 \r\n Statistical analysis was performed using statistical software (Statistical Package for Social Science, version 11.0; SPSS; Chicago, IL). Cumulative steroid dosage during inpatient treatment and outpatient follow-up was converted into hydrocortisone in milligrams to facilitate analysis of this study. Continuous variables were compared using independent-sample t test, whereas the Mann-Whitney U test was used for nonparametric data. Categorical variables were compared using the 2 test. All statistical tests were two tailed. Statistical significance was taken as p \u03fd 0.05. Univariate analyses were performed to evaluate the potential determinants of exercise capacity expressed as the 6MWD. Variables significant in univariate analysis (p \u03fd 0.1) were included in the multivariate analysis. Age and sex were controlled in the analysis of the final multivariable models because they are independent determinants of the 6MWD. 16, 34 Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess serial changes in 6MWT distance and CXR scores.\r\n Of the first 138 patients with SARS infection in March 2003, 15 patients (10.9%) died. 19 Among the 123 survivors, 13 patients (10.6%) did not attend follow-up at 3 months and 6 months, 16 whereas another 13 patients (10.6%) defaulted the 12-month assessment. Of the 13 defaulters at 12 months, 11 patients had normal lung function indexes, whereas the other 2 patients had Dlco of 68% and 78% of predicted normal values, respectively, at 6 months. Thus, there were only 97 patients (78.9%) who had completed the three assessments; among these, 63 patients (65%) were HCWs (doctors, nurses, ward assistants, and medical students) and 58 patients (66%) were women. The mean age was 36.9 years (SD, 9.5 years) and body mass index (BMI) was 23.7 kg\/m 2 (SD, 4.0 kg\/m 2 ) during the visit at 12 months from illness onset. The hospital length of stay (LOS) for the group was 22.7 days (SD, 14.6 days). There were only three smokers (3.3%) among the whole group. There were 15 patients with medical comorbidities, which included COPD (n \u03ed 1; 1.1%); ischemic heart disease (n \u03ed 1; 1.1%); ischemic stroke (n \u03ed 1; 1.1%); breast cancer (patient in stable clinical condition receiving tamoxifen) [n \u03ed 1; 1.1%]; diabetes mellitus (n \u03ed 3; 3.3%); cirrhosis (n \u03ed 1; 1.1%), hypertension (n \u03ed 4; 4.1%); and asymptomatic hepatitis B carrier (n \u03ed 3; 3.3%).\r\n Among the 97 patients, 31 patients (32%; 17 men and 14 women) required ICU admission, with an ICU LOS of 13.5 days (SD, 15.6 days; median, 7 days; range, 2 to 64 days), whereas 6 patients (5.5%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Based on our ICU admission criteria, 19 all 31 patients would have a Pao 2 \/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio \u03fd 300 mm Hg, whereas the 6 patients who were intubated had a Pao 2 \/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio \u03fd 200 mm Hg. Among these 31 patients, 6 patients had medical comorbidities, including ischemic heart disease (n \u03ed 1; 0.9%), diabetes mellitus (n \u03ed 1; 0.9%), hypertension (n \u03ed 2; 1.8%), and asymptomatic hepatitis B carrier (n \u03ed 2; 1.8%), but none had any history of smoking or pulmonary disease.\r\n An overview of the serial lung function tests and respiratory muscle strength results for the group are shown in Table 1 . Overall, lung volume parameters and surface area for exchange were well preserved at 3, 6, and 12 months. There was significant reduction in Dlco, FEF , and alveolar volume (Va), whereas there was an increase in Kco over the study period of 12 months. Pimax and Pemax values \u03fd 80 cm H 2 O were noted in 16 patients (14.5%) and 8 patients (7.3%), respectively, at 12 months.\r\n The frequency of SARS survivors with lung function parameters \u03fd 80% of predicted values is as follows: 3 months, FEV 1 (n \u03ed 3; 3.1%), FVC (n \u03ed 6; 6.2%), VC (n \u03ed 6; 6.2%), TLC (n \u03ed 7; 7.3%), Dlco (n \u03ed 13; 13.5%), and Kco (n \u03ed 2; 2.1%); 6 months, FEV 1 (n \u03ed 4; 4.1%), FVC (n \u03ed 4; 4.1%), VC (n \u03ed 5; 5.2%), TLC (n \u03ed 8; 8.2%), Dlco (n \u03ed 15; 15.5%), and Kco (n \u03ed 1; 1.0%); and 12 months, FEV 1 (n \u03ed 5; 5.2%), FVC (n \u03ed 4; 4.1%), VC (n \u03ed 5; 5.2%), TLC (n \u03ed 5; 5.2%), Dlco (n \u03ed 23; 23.7%), and Kco (n \u03ed 0; 0%). Thus, there were 23 patients (23.7%) with impaired Dlco, whereas up to 5.2% of patients had reduction in parameters of lung volume at 12 months.\r\n The mean 6MWD increased significantly, from 464 m (SD, 87 m) at 3 months to 502 m (SD, 97 m) and 511 m (SD, 90 m) at 6 months and 12 months, respectively (p value for trend \u03fd 0.01). When the subjects were stratified into different age groups and compared to the corresponding normative values, their exercise capacity was generally significantly lower than the normal subjects ( Table 2 ). The 6MWDs of the SARS survivors at 3, 6 and 12 months, in comparison with normative data, are shown in Table 3 .\r\n Univariate followed by multivariate analyses, controlled for age and gender, were performed to look for factors associated with 6MWD (Table 3) . At 3 months, there was no independent predictor identified, whereas percentage of predicted FVC was the only positive independent predictor for 6MWD at 6 months. At 12 months, the independent positive predictors for 6MWD were percentage of predicted FVC and percentage of predicted Dlco.\r\n Thirty-seven patients (38.1%) were noted to have abnormal total CXR scores at 3 months involving 3.9% (SD, 3.5%; range, 0.5 to 15%) of the total lung fields, whereas 32 patients (33%) had abnormal CXR scores involving 3.1% (SD, 3.4%; range, 0.8 to 15%) of the lung fields at 6 months. At 1 year, 27 patients (27.8%) had abnormal CXR findings involving 2.9% (SD, 3.1%; range, 0.8 to 15%) of lung fields. By repeated-measures ANOVA analysis of patients with abnormal CXR scores (n \u03ed 37), there was a significant trend for improvement from 3 to 12 months (p \u03ed 0.001).\r\n Correlations between the extent of CXR abnormality vs cumulative steroid dosage, lung function parameters, and 6MWD at 12 months were examined. There was a significant positive correlation between the extent of radiographic abnormalities (percentage of lung fields) and the cumulative hydrocortisone dosage (r \u03ed 0.43, p \u03fd 0.01). There were significant negative correlations between the extent (percentage) of radiographic abnormalities and TLC (r \u03ed \u03ea 0.25, p \u03ed 0.01) and Dlco (r \u03ed \u03ea 0.37, p \u03fd 0.01). However, no significant correlations were noted between the extent of radiographic abnormalities vs 6MWD (r \u03ed \u03ea 0.14, p \u03ed 0.17), FEV 1 (r \u03ed \u03ea 0.08, p \u03ed 0.42), RV (r \u03ed \u03ea 0.21, *Data are presented as mean (SD). \u2020In comparison between 12 months and 3 months, the mean difference for FEF was \u03ea 8.2% (95% CI, \u03ea 11.2 to \u03ea 5.2; p \u03fd 0.001), whereas the mean difference was \u03ea 2.2% (95% CI, \u03ea 5.1 to 0.7; p \u03ed 133) in comparison between 12 months and 6 months (p value for linear trend \u03fd 0.001). \u2021In comparison between 12 months and 3 months, the mean difference for Dlco was \u03ea 3.8% (95% CI, \u03ea 6.6 to \u03ea 1.0; p \u03ed 0.008), whereas the mean difference was \u03ea 3.7% (95% CI, \u03ea 6.0 to \u03ea 1.4; p \u03ed 0.002) in comparison between 12 months and 6 months (p value for linear trend 0.008). \u00a7In comparison between 12 months and 3 months, the mean difference for Kco was 7.0% (95% CI, 4.5 to 9.5; p \u03fd 0.01), whereas the mean difference was 3.2% (95% CI, 1.1 to 5.2%; p \u03ed 0.004) in comparison between 12 months and 6 months (p value for linear trend \u03fd 0.001). \u0288There was a significant decrease in Va from 3 to 12 months (mean difference, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.40; p \u03fd 0.01), and from 6 to 12 months (mean difference, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.28; p \u03fd 0.01) \u0353p value for linear trend \u03fd 0.001\u0354. \r\n Patients who had required ICU admission (n \u03ed 31; 17 men and 14 women) had a higher peak lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, a higher peak C-reactive protein (CRP) level, a longer hospital LOS, and received a significantly higher total steroid dose than those who did not require ICU care ( Table  4 ). The lung function tests at 12 months showed significantly lower percentage of predicted FVC, VC, TLC, RV, and Dlco in survivors who required ICU support than those who were treated on medical wards, although no significant difference was noted for 6MWD and respiratory muscle strength between the two groups ( Table 5) . SF-36 domain scores at 3, 6, and 12 months after illness onset in patients who did and did not require ICU support during the acute illness in comparison to normative data are shown in Figure 1 (more data are available only in on-line supplemental Tables 7-9). There was significant impairment of health status among our SARS survivors at 12 months compared to control subjects of the same age groups. When directly comparing those who had required ICU admission against those treated on the medical wards, there was no significant difference in all SF-36 domains between the two groups at 12 months. When comparing the 25 patients who did not require intubation in ICU against those who had required intubation (n \u03ed 6), the latter had more severe lung injury, as reflected by a higher peak In addition, there were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to lung function indexes and SF-36 domain scores at 12 months (data available only in on-line supplemental Table 10 ).\r\n This prospective cohort study has shown that 23.7% and 27.8% of SARS survivors had impairment of Dlco and abnormal CXR findings, respectively, at 1 year after illness onset. Overall, the serial assessments of 6MWD showed a significant improvement over 12 months, but exercise capacity and health status were still significantly lower than those of normal control subjects of the same age groups. The 1-year lung function indexes (percentage of predicted FVC, VC, TLC, RV, and Dlco) in survivors who required ICU support were remarkably lower than those of patients who were treated on medical wards, although no significant differences were noted for 6MWD, respiratory muscle strength, and health status between the two groups. Interestingly, there was no difference in lung function indexes, exercise capacity, and health status at 1 year between the ICU-intubated and the ICU-nonintubated SARS patients, although the former had more severe lung injury.\r\n Based on the HRCT appearance of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and the clinical suspicion that progression of the pulmonary disease might be mediated by the host inflammatory response, 4 pulse methylprednisolone was administered during clinical progression of SARS with a favorable response. 7, 19, [35] [36] [37] Lung histopathologic condition of fatal SARS cases was dominated by diffuse alveolar damage and extensive consolidation, 38 -40 but features of BOOP were indeed noted. 41 At 6 months after admission to hospital, residual abnormalities of pulmonary function were observed in three fourths of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital cohort in HK (n \u03ed 57), mostly consisting of isolated reductions in Dlco, whereas an abnormal HRCT score was detected in 75.4% of patients. 42 In contrast, 15.5% of our SARS survivors had impaired Dlco at 6 months, 16 whereas HRCT performed on 44 patients revealed ground-glass opacification and reticulation in 38 patients (86.4%) and 35 patients (92.1%), respectively. 43 At 1 year, 23.7% of our patients had significant impairment of Dlco with well-preserved Kco. The serial results suggest an increase of the intra-alveolar diffusion pathway, which might be the result of diffuse alveolar damage and\/or BOOP initially, 38 -41 followed by postinflammatory changes such as atelectasis, ongoing alveolitis, and parenchymal fibrosis later in the course of the disease. Our results are similar to a long-term follow-up study 44 in Beijing that reported that 27.3% of their SARS survivors (85 of 311 patients) had impaired Dlco, whereas 21.5% exhibited radiographic evidence of lung fibrotic changes at 1 year. Several studies 45-47 on ARDS survivors have shown that their pulmonary function generally returns to normal or near normal by 6 to 12 months, but Dlco may remain abnormal in up to 80% of patients at 1 year after recovery. 14 The decreasing trend for Va, discordant with TLC, observed in our study suggests there might be maldistribution of the inert gas during the single-breath Dlco maneuver, such as in the setting of occult small airway obstruction in some patients. Although expiratory HRCT was not performed in adult patients, 42,43 a pediatric study 48 of 47 asymptomatic children at 6 months from diagnosis of SARS showed that 16 patients (34%) had pulmonary abnormalities, whereas 8 patients (17%) had evidence of air trapping on expiratory HRCT.\r\n The self-paced 6MWT was performed to evaluate the global and integrated responses to exercise, although it did not provide specific information on the function of individual organs and systems. 21 Although showing considerable improvement over 12 months, the 6MWD was markedly reduced for most age groups compared to normal control subjects. Previous studies 12, 49 have shown that 6MWD was substantially lower among ARDS survivors than control subjects 1 to 2 years after mechanical ventilation, whereas the absence of systemic steroid treatment, absence of illness acquired during ICU stay, and rapid resolution of lung injury were important factors associated with a longer 6MWD at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. 12 After controlling for the known effects of age and gender, our analysis has shown that percentage of predicted FVC was the positive independent factor associated with higher 6MWD at 6 months, whereas percentage of predicted FVC and percentage of predicted Dlco were the positive independent predictors at 12 months.\r\n Given the relatively well-preserved lung function in the majority of our SARS survivors, the poor performance in the 6MWT in most age groups could be due to additional factors such as muscle wasting, myopathy, and possibly cardiac diastolic dysfunction. 50 Lau et al 51 noted that muscle strength and endurance were more impaired in proximal than in distal muscles among survivors in our SARS cohort at 3 months after illness onset. Eighteen of 44 SARS survivors in Singapore had reduced exercise capacity at 3 months after hospital discharge that could not be accounted for by impairment of pulmonary function. 52 These results suggest that the inability to exercise in recovered SARS patients is primarily due to extrapulmonary causes such as physical deconditioning and possibly steroid myopathy. 51, 52 In addition, 53% of SARS survivors complained of some 36) among SARS survivors at 3, 6, and 12 months after illness onset in comparison with HK normative data stratified into different age groups. 24 The vertical axis represents SF-36 domain score in mean (SD) from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum), whereas the horizontal axis defines age groups in years. Based on the study by Lam et al, 24 there were 1,244 normal subjects and 695 normal subjects in the age groups of 18 to 40 years and 41 to 64 years, respectively. There were 19 SARS survivors and 12 SARS survivors who had required ICU support in the age groups of 18 to 40 years and 41 to 64 years, whereas there were 60 SARS survivors and 19 SARS survivors who did not require ICU support in the same age groups, respectively. *Significant at p \u03fd 0.01. **Significant at p \u03fd 0.03. #Significant at p \u03fd 0.05. mth \u03ed month. degree of large-joint pain, although only 12 patients (4.7%, including 7 patients in the current study) of 254 SARS survivors in our cluster of hospitals had evidence of osteonecrosis of the long bones on MRI conducted at a median of 6.7 months from hospital admission. 53 There are several possible causes for muscle weakness among SARS survivors. More than 60% of our patients complained of myalgia with elevation of creatinine kinase in 32.1% suggestive of viral-induced myositis at initial presentation. 7 Most of our patients required bed rest during hospitalization for an average of 3 weeks. The long period of bed rest could lead to muscle wasting and deconditioning, whereas the use of systemic corticosteroid therapy to suppress immune-mediated lung injury 4,7-9,19 could contribute to myopathy. Steroid myopathy has been reported in patients administered high-dose steroid for acute lung transplant rejection 54 and status asthmaticus. 55 Critical illness-associated polyneuropathy\/ myopathy has also been observed in SARS survivors. 56 A small proportion of our SARS patients had evidence of respiratory muscle weakness. Inspiratory muscle weakness may cause atelectasis, whereas expiratory muscle (abdominal and intercostal muscles) weakness may lead to air trapping.\r\n In addition, there was significant impairment of health status in most SF-36 domains among our patients at 12 months. There were significant and positive correlations between lung function parameters (VC, FVC, FEV 1 , and Dlco) and SF-36 domains such as PF, RP, GH, SF, and RE. There were also significant positive correlations between 6MWD and all SF-36 domains except for MH. The results are not surprising as, in addition to the physical impairment, the long period of isolation and extreme uncertainty during the SARS illness had created enormous psychological stress 57 and mood distur-bances. 58 In addition, steroid toxicity, personal vulnerability, and psychosocial stressors might have jointly contributed to the development of psychosis in some patients. 59 Other studies 11-14 on acute lung injury or ARDS survivors unrelated to SARS have reported impaired health status at 1 to 5 years after recovery, whereas pulmonary function abnormalities, especially Dlco, correlated with SF-36 domains. 13, 14 Twenty-seven patients (27.8%) in this study still had abnormal radiographic scores at 12 months, although their serial CXRs showed significant improvement. The positive correlation between the extent of residual radiographic abnormalities and the cumulative steroid dosage used for SARS was expected, as the former was an indication on the treatment protocol for more systemic steroid during the outbreak. 4, 7, 19 The negative correlation between residual radiographic abnormality and lung volume parameter (TLC) and parameter of surface area for gas exchange (Dlco) reflected the physiologic effects of parenchymal inflammation and fibrosis. Patients with more severe disease (as reflected by higher peak LDH level) 7, 19, 35 who had required ICU support during the acute illness had more residual opacities on CXRs at 12 months. In addition, they had more extensive pulmonary injury and fibrosis, as reflected by a significantly lower lung volume parameter (TLC) and Dlco at 12 months than those treated on the general wards. There were, however, no significant differences in 6MWD and HRQoL between the two groups at 12 months. In addition, there were no differences in any functional parameters between ICU patients receiving and not receiving mechanical ventilation. Herridge et al 12 reported that 20% of their ARDS survivors had minor abnormalities on CXRs at 1 year.\r\n There are several limitations to this study. Firstly, 24 Among the normal control subjects, 1,244 subjects and 695 subjects were in the age groups 18 to 40 years and 41 to 64 years, whereas there were 50 subjects and 16 subjects who were SARS survivors in the same age categories, respectively.

CPET would also be too labor-intensive for a large cohort of SARS survivors. Nevertheless, reduced pulmonary gas exchange has been detected with CPET in some survivors of SARS at 3 months with normal Dlco. 52 Secondly, only 97 of 123 survivors (79%) in the cohort had completed the serial assessments over 12 months, and the results might not be representative of the entire cohort. Thirdly, we assessed respiratory muscle strength with mouth pressure, but low Pemax values do not always indicate expiratory muscle weakness and might result from technical difficulties such as mouth leakage. Lastly, we could not measure the effects of extrapulmonary factors (such as muscle deconditioning, steroid or viralinduced myopathy, cardiac diastolic dysfunction, critical illness polyneuropathy and\/or myopathy) in the poor performance of the 6MWT. It is difficult to determine the contribution by psychological and motivational factors, as many patients are seeking compensation for occupation-related SARS. In summary, this study has shown significant impairment of Dlco in 23.7% of SARS survivors, whereas their exercise capacity and health status were remarkably lower than the general population at 12 months after illness onset. The functional disability appears to be out of proportion to the degree of lung function impairment and may be due to additional factors such as muscle deconditioning, steroid-related musculoskeletal complications, critical illness-related neuropathy\/myopathy, and other psychological factors. Further follow-up is needed to assess if these deficits are persistent.

This is a prospective, longitudinal, follow-up study of patients with SARS discharged from our hospital after surviving the major outbreak in 2003. The diagnosis of SARS was based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria at the time. 18 All patients in this study had subsequent laboratory confirmation of SARS. 20, 21 In addition, they completed the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) to measure HRQoL. 22 6MWT: The 6MWT provides a standardized, objective, integrated assessment of cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal function that is relevant to daily activities.

COPD contributes to morbidity and mortality and to a signifi cant use of health-care resources and expense on a global scale; this is especially true in developing countries. 2-4 The burden of COPD in China is currently greater than that found in developed countries. This is probably due to greater exposure to epidemic risk factors, an imbalance in economic development, and health-care disparities between urban and rural areas. The reported prevalence of COPD Although, to our knowledge, there has been no exhaustive or credible review of the evidence of the disease burden of COPD in China, COPD has become an increasing public health concern to the Chinese medical community. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence and evaluate and clarify the disease burden of COPD in China with the aim of improving effective management. We reviewed previous studies of COPD in China, which included data on prevalence, mortality, disease burden, risk factors, diagnosis, and management by searching related Web sites, including PubMed, ProQuest, and Thomson Reuters' Web of Knowledge, as well as major Chinese databases and government Web sites. Reported COPD prevalence varied between 5% and 13% in different provinces\/cities across China. In 2008, COPD ranked fourth as a leading cause of death in urban areas and third in rural areas. In addition, COPD accounted for 1.6% of all hospital admissions in China in that year. The high prevalence of smoking and biomass fuel use acted as major contributors to the high occurrence of COPD in China. Management of COPD in China should focus on adjusting the distribution of medical resources and on addressing public health policies to facilitate earlier diagnosis in rural areas, aim to reduce smoking prevalence, improve patients' self-management, and keep physicians' knowledge up to date and consistent with current guidelines. COPD is one of the most challenging medical issues facing China because of its infl uence on both personal and public health and its impact on the economy. Optimal management strategies should be adopted and strengthened immediately.\r\n CHEST 2011; 139(4):920-929","text_body":"When cor pulmonale deaths with documented COPD history were included, COPD-related mortality increased to 179.9 for men and to 141.3 for women per 100,000 persons. 24 Both rates were much higher than the corresponding estimated rates in the Asia-Pacifi c region (64-92 per 100,000 population in men and 21-35 per 100,000 population in women). 25 It was reported that COPD-related mortality was higher in rural areas than in urban areas, mainly because of the unavailability of health-care resources and more exposure to indoor air pollution. Another fi nding showed that COPD-related mortality in northern China was higher than in other locations; 24 the higher mortality rate in the north might be associated with a colder climate, more use of biomass fuel, heavier outdoor air pollution, and lower socioeconomic status. Although mortality rates fell, hospitalization rates continued to rise in the last decade. Hospitalization rates for COPD jumped from 1.0% in 1998 (urban vs rural was 1.4% vs 0.8%) to 1.6% in 2008 (urban vs rural was 1.5% vs 1.6%). Correspondingly, the gap between rural and urban areas narrowed ( Fig 1B ) . 22 This is partially a result of the increase in incidence but it also indicates that patients in rural areas are more aware of COPD, and that resources for rural residents have been increasing. The hospitalization rate trend is consistent with that of other Asian countries. 26 Burden of COPD COPD treatments are extremely costly in China and impose an enormous economic burden on both families and society. Health-care expenses were inves tigated with person-to-person interviews in a cross-sectional survey conducted among 723 COPD out patients in six large cities in China. 27 It was found that the annual direct medical expense for urban patients in 2006 was $1732.24 per patient, whereas the estimated indirect expense spent on nutraceutics, transportation, and end-of-life care was $231.6 per patient. Total expense for one COPD patient ($1963.8) accounted for 40% of the average family's total income ($4849.8) . Evidence showed that the cost of COPD was strongly correlated with the severity of disease and that hospitalization acted as a major contributor to total cost. 26, 28 It was suggested that reducing hospitalization frequency through better management could result in a crucial decrease in health-care expenses. Moreover, the burden of COPD has been underestimated consistently because of premature mortality and impaired productivity of patients and their family members. The overall disease burden, measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), was predicted to double over the next 2.5 decades worldwide, at which point COPD would move from the 13th-highest cause of DALYs\r\n There is still a need for well-designed nationwide epidemiologic studies of COPD in China. A population-based, cross-sectional survey of COPD conducted between 2002 and 2004 showed that the overall prevalence of the disease in people aged . 40 years was 8.2%, 5 which would result in a COPD patient population of . 43 million in that time period. It was reported that the prevalence of COPD varied widely among locations across the country, from 5% to 13% ( Table 1 ) . [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Most locations had a higher prevalence of COPD than the World Health Organization model-estimated prevalence for China (6.7%) 20 and the reported prevalence rates in Western countries (4%-10%). 21 But the cross-sectional survey of COPD results were consistent with the pooled prevalence (meta-analysis) of the Western Pacifi c Region (9.0%). 3 The crude prevalence of COPD was significantly higher in men than in women (8.3%-18.9% vs 3.8%-7.1%), in rural areas than in urban areas (4.4%-16.7% vs 6.7%-8.3%), in the elderly, and in nonsmoking rural women. These differences were associated with gender, smoking status, biomass fuel use, occupational dust exposure, socioeconomic status, and availability of health-care resources. It was reported that approximately two-thirds of the patients were underdiagnosed, and the prevalence of diagnosed COPD in rural areas was apparently lower than that in urban areas, 21 suggesting an inferior diagnostic rate in rural areas.\r\n The Global Burden of Disease study conducted in 2004 showed that about 3 million people die of COPD each year, of which 1.8 million deaths occur in middleincome countries. COPD is expected to become the third leading cause of death globally by 2030, trailing only ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. 4 According to data published by the Chinese Ministry of Health, COPD ranks as the fourth leading cause of death in urban areas and third leading in rural areas. 22 Both crude and age-adjusted COPD mortality rates have fl uctuated but have displayed a decreasing trend from 1990 ( Fig 1A ) , 22 which is probably because of improved management of COPD, upgraded technologies, and awareness of the disease.\r\n Another nationwide, large-scale, long-term prospective cohort study between 1990 and 2000 demonstrated that COPD-related mortality was 27.3 for men and 21.3 for women per 100,000 persons . 40 years of age, making COPD the seventh leading cause of death in men and eighth leading in women. 23 \r\n In 2002, about 30% of the world's cigarettes were manufactured and consumed in China, 30 which had worldwide to the seventh-highest by 2030. The burden of COPD in China was greater than that in developed Western countries, and it ranked second among chronic diseases as a leading cause of DALYs lost in 2001 ( Fig 2 ) . 29 be attributed to passive smoking. 40 In contrast to these fi ndings, no signifi cant association between COPD and passive smoking was revealed in other localized surveys. 7, 11, 40 In the survey conducted by Yang et al, 43 about 74% of the smokers indicated that they did not want to quit, which may be partly because of ignorance about the harmful effects of smoking. About 20% of the smokers had intended to quit smoking at least once, of which about one-half reverted to smoking. 43, 44 Smoking cessation has been the most cost-effective intervention in COPD management, 1 and the importance of effective tobacco-control programs cannot be emphasized too strongly. Men and women who stopped smoking in 2003 were expected to lower their absolute risks of COPD by 56% and 63% after 5 years relative to those who continued smoking. 45 Antismoking education should focus the public's attention on the risk of active and passive smoking, as well as the expense of smoking, especially among the poor. 46 \r\n The use of biomass fuels has been considered one of the most important risk factors for COPD. [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] Men and women who are exposed to biomass smoke have an odds ratio of 4.30 and 2.73, respectively, for developing COPD, relative to those not exposed to biomass smoke. 51 It was reported that solid fuels, such as wood, crop residues, and coal, were used in . 70% of Chinese households, whereas in rural areas, the rate increased to 90%. 40, 52 In a cluster disproportional random sampling survey performed in populations aged . 40 years in urban and rural areas in Guangdong, COPD prevalence among rural nonsmoking women was found to be signifi cantly higher than that among urban nonsmoking women (7.2% vs 2.5%). Univariate analysis showed a signifi cant association between COPD and exposure to biomass fuel for cooking. 50 In an estimated 350 million smokers 2 ; furthermore, the prevalence of smoking in women has been increasing ( Fig 3 ) . [30] [31] [32] [33] In addition, there has been a steady increase in the rate of household second-hand smoke exposure, 34 and the rate of passive smoking among nonsmoking females has increased to 82.5%. 35 Taking all smokers and passive smokers into consideration, 72% of Chinese aged . 15 years were tobacco exposed. 36 Individuals who were less educated, poorer, and employed in stressful jobs were more likely to be heavy smokers and less likely to quit than were wealthier, better-educated individuals. Smoking the Chinese pipe was once prevalent in rural areas, but only a minority of people do it today. Smokers consumed cheaper cigarettes but spent a larger proportion of their personal income on smoking.\r\n (The cost of cigarettes per pack varied from $0.294 to $33.971 in China 37 ). Smoking has been recognized as the most important causative factor in the pathogenesis of COPD. 38 In 2005, a total of 673,000 deaths were attributed to smoking in China, whereas 268,000, 146,200, and 66,800 deaths were attributed to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease, respectively. 39 In another case-control study, conducted from 2000 to 2001 in Nanjing, a signifi cant dose-response relationship between COPD and total amount of cigarettes smoked was detected after adjusting for other risk factors. The study further showed that women smokers were more susceptible to COPD. 21, 40 Because of a diversity of methodologies and exposure assessment criteria, there are confl icting results regarding an association between passive smoking and the risk of COPD. The aim of the Biobank Cohort Study was to demonstrate that the high prevalence of COPD among Chinese nonsmokers is the result of a positive dose-response relationship between passive smoking exposure and any respiratory symptom. 41, 42 It was estimated that 1.9 million excessive deaths from COPD without smoking could 45, 54 Along with rapid development of the economy and urbanization in most rural areas, indoor air pollution and ventilation in the kitchen would be gradually improved and the negative infl uence of biomass fuel use on health would be expected to decrease.\r\n COPD is a complex condition resulting from the interaction of environmental and genetic factors. Familial clustering was reported in the studies of COPD in China. 6, 7, [9] [10] [11] 15, 51 Several gene polymorphisms have been investigated in the Chinese population, but there is a need for further clarifi cation and confi rmation. Individuals with a 1-antiprotease deficiency had a markedly increased risk of developing COPD in Europe, 55 whereas few patients with a 1 -antiprotease defi ciency developed COPD in China. 56 Another case-control study among the Han population in southwest China failed to obtain evidence of the contribution of SERPINE2 polymorphism to COPD susceptibility, 57 although it has been accepted as a candidate gene in other populations. 58 It was suggested that there might be other genetic factors involved in the development of COPD in the Chinese population.\r\n Microsomal epoxide hydrolase is an enzyme that potentially reduces oxidative stress by detoxifying epoxide compounds such as those found in cigarette smoke. An updated meta-analysis of 16 studies on such hydrolase polymorphisms in COPD in the Asian population suggested that the slow activity phenotype of the enzyme is associated with an increased risk of COPD, and the fast activity phenotype is a protective factor in the development of COPD. 59 Genetic polymorphism in Heme oxygenase-1, one of the antioxidant enzymes, was found to be associated with the severity of COPD in southwest China. 60,61 g -Glutamylcysteine synthetase and 8-hydroxy-guanine glycosylase both play roles in the antioxidant defenses, and both were reported to be not associated with susceptibility to COPD in a southern Chinese population. 62 Polymorphisms of IL-27 gene, 63 matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene, 64 tumor necrosis factor-a , 65-67 and aquaporin 5 68,69 were demonstrated to play roles in susceptibility to COPD. Clara cell 16 kDa secretory protein, which plays a potential role in the control of infl ammatory response, was not found to be associated with the development of COPD. 59 The study of gene polymorphisms might be helpful in defi ning patient a retrospective cohort study, installation of chimneys on household coal stoves led to a substantial reduction in COPD incidence. 53 Other evidence showed that when biomass fuel was used in cooking and\/or heating, the exposure time and ventilation status in the kitchen\/living room were associated with COPD prevalence. 5, 6, 9, [11] [12] [13] [14] 52 Biomass smoke may interact with cigarette smoking in the pathogenesis of COPD, with ORs of 4.39 and 2.55 for cigarette smokers and nonsmokers, respectively. 51 A meta-analysis of many epidemiologic studies demonstrated that if the status of smoking and solid-fuel use persists, then 65 million deaths from COPD can be expected, and 82% of COPD deaths between now and 2033 will be attrib- 29 The DALYs lost caused by chronic diseases accounted for 70% of the total DALYs lost. Cerebrovascular disease and COPD ranked as the top two leading causes of DALYs lost in China, responsible for 17.9% and 13.9%, respectively, followed by ischemic heart disease, gastric cancer, liver and lung cancer, and others. sion of COPD. However, more than one-third (35.3%) of COPD patients were asymptomatic, whereas only one-third of subjects with GOLD stage I COPD were diagnosed with respiratory disease. 5 In a recent study, the diagnosis of COPD was made in 148 of the 1,624 subjects aged . 40 years in fi ve villages of northern China according to the standards set in the GOLD guideline, whereas none of the patients had ever been diagnosed previously. 85 Another retrospective study demonstrated that only 15.9% of the patients in southern China were diagnosed with mild-degree COPD, whereas most of the patients were at a severe or extremely severe stage when fi rst diagnosized. 86 This could be attributed to the fact that most Chinese patients, especially those in rural areas with major health-care disparities, are used to bottling up their discomfort until the development of signifi cant symptoms and\/or exacerbations.\r\n Physicians continue to diagnose and manage patients with COPD without verifying the diagnosis and assessing the severity with spirometry. According to GOLD guidelines, spirometry is the gold standard in the measurement of airfl ow limitation 1 because of its reliable, simple, safe and inexpensive grading, monitoring, and assessing of the disease. However, less than one-third of COPD diagnoses were made with the aid of spirometry 87 and in some rural areas none of the subgroups, leading to the development of different approaches to the prevention and treatment of COPD.\r\n Studies have shown that smoking and the individual's socioeconomic status are correlated to the infl uence of occupational exposure on COPD prevalence. [70] [71] [72] [73] Studies have investigated green tea as an antioxidant in the treatment of COPD and have found that its use might prevent the occurrence of the disease. 74 There is a need to evaluate how tea drinking or other dietary habits may infl uence the development or treatment of COPD in China. Malnutrition may aggravate dyspnea and exercise intolerance in COPD patients by weakening respiratory muscle strength. Low BMI was reported to be closely connected with a high incidence of COPD, 75,76 as well as an increased hospitalization rate and poor prognosis. 77, 78 Outdoor air pollution is also considered an important risk factor for COPD, evidenced by the fact that ambient concentrations of air pollutants have an adverse effect on hospital admissions for COPD. 79 Another case-crossover analysis of air pollution and daily mortality in Shanghai showed an association between air pollution and mortality with COPD and cardiovascular causes. 80 The results confi rmed the deleterious role played by the current air pollution level in COPD, especially in large cities like Shanghai. In addition, low educational level, chronic cough or respiratory infection in childhood, low socioeconomic status, and reduced physical activities have all been reported to contribute to the increased incidence of COPD independently or jointly.\r\n A national strategy for the management of COPD, drafted by the Chinese Medical Association, was fi rst published in 2002 and then updated annually. 81 Doctors are also encouraged to adopt the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) guideline for the care of patients with COPD. 1 Despite widely disseminated evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, current knowledge of primary care physicians and management of patients with COPD remain suboptimal. [82] [83] [84] Barriers to the implementation of guidelines are multifarious, whether physician related or patient related.\r\n A lack of awareness about biomarkers and risk factors for COPD among physicians had led to delayed diagnosis and interventions for patients. Early diagnosis may help patients quit smoking and lead to the adoption of effective therapies to prevent progres- monary physicians, showed that expectorants were the most often prescribed medications, followed by b 2 -agonists and anticholinergics. 97 Instead of longacting bronchodilators, more than one-half of the patients were prescribed short-or medium-acting bronchodilators, which was inconsistent with the guidelines. 81 Most of the physicians underused oxygen therapy, noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation, and antiinfl ammation therapy. 82 Only 20% of the primary care physicians were fully knowledgeable about pharmacologic therapies for COPD. 98 Prospects COPD represents a challenging issue because of its impact on both personal and public health and its economic consequences. There is an urgent need to understand the present and future burden of COPD in China from well-designed epidemiologic studies on its prevalence and morbidity. Because of ethnic differences, studies on genetic susceptibility to COPD among the Chinese population should be carried out to improve prevention and lead to early diagnosis. Because China is the world's largest cigarette manufacturer and because it is the world's largest consumer of cigarettes, there is a great challenge to restrict and regulate smoking in China with an intent to reduce the burden of COPD. During the last decade, smoking prevention and cessation programs have been implemented widely and preliminary results have been observed ( Tables 2, 3 ) . 29, 99, 100 However, there are many factors affecting the execution of smoking laws and regulations by the government. Rural workers, teenagers, and women with high or rising rates of smoking need to be targeted specifi cally for tobaccocontrol measures. The existing public health policies should be strengthened and new strategies, including raising taxes and the price of cigarettes, should be put into effect. On the other hand, physicians should take the leading role in the fi ght against smoking. It has been found that about 40% of male physicians are current smokers, 101 which adds to the diffi culty of smoking control. patients diagnosed with COPD received a spirometry test. [6] [7] [8] In 185 previously diagnosed COPD patients, 67 were confi rmed by spirometry based on diagnostic criteria, 47 had normal lung function, and 63 had mixed ventilation disorder. 88 Profound underuse of spirometry was considered to be a barrier to decent care of Chinese COPD patients. 89 Barriers hindering use of spirometry in clinical practice include ignorance of the crucial role of spirometry, facility inaccessibility, and limited budgets, especially in most of the primary care settings.\r\n Patients are not knowledgeable about how to manage their COPD. Health education on self-management for patients should be taken into account to reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations and to improve quality of life. 90, 91 However, COPD patients were found to lack general knowledge about the disease. For example, the term \"COPD\" was recognized by , 30% of the patients who regularly visited hospitals, whereas an even lower number of rural patients recognized the term. 85, 92 Patients also lacked awareness of COPD risk factors, the importance of lung function tests, inhalation therapy, and oxygen therapy. [93] [94] [95] About 20% of patients were current smokers, of which 23% did not know the harmful effect of smoking on the disease. 96 Unfortunately, no health education program was available in rural areas, although all patients were willing to read information about COPD. 84, 85, 96 Patients took the initial advice for smoking cessation from primary care physicians, so there is a great need to implement evidence-based guidelines and demand that physicians take immediate action. Studies in some urban hospitals demonstrated that 64.5% of the COPD patients quit smoking after application of general interventions, whereas the cessation rate of the control group was only 28%. 86 Underuse of home oxygen therapy, lung function training, and nutrition support among patients 94,95 also suggested the necessity of patient education to facilitate comprehensive rehabilitation.\r\n The recommendations made by physicians often do not meet the standard of the GOLD guidelines. According to the GOLD guidelines, bronchodilators, including b 2 -agonists, anticholinergics, and methylxanthines, should be the basic agents for all patients, whereas inhaled corticosteroids are recommended only for patients with moderate\/severe airfl ow obstruction and\/or frequent exacerbations. An investigation of the application of pharmacologic therapy conducted in six cities, using face-to-face interviews among 723 patients with stable COPD and 258 pul- Table 3 \r\n Smoking control is required for the criterion of \"national clean city\" Smoking is prohibited in public places Knowledge that \"smoking is harmful to health\" is spread through media Attend international smoking cessation contest, encourage the building of a no smoking community and no smoking unit Smoking by teenagers is reduced through laws or local regulations and school-based prevention programs Doctors are encouraged to give up smoking to raise society's awareness of its harmful effects Another challenge is delayed diagnosis and underestimation of frequent exacerbations in the management of COPD. Screening by spirometry is impractical in most primary care settings and rural areas, indicating the urgent need for disease-specifi c biomarkers to facilitate early diagnosis and identify high-risk populations. 102, 103 Management techniques of COPD should take into consideration cultural variations and mental and physical comorbidities, such as psychologic depression. Comorbidities could infl uence patients' quality of life, increase hospitalization, and reduce survival. The role played by fi nances should also be taken into account to improve the poor management of COPD. For example, the cost for drug therapy ($443-$738 per year) in the maintenance phase is a huge economic burden for families and individuals, especially for rural residents. Less than 40% of patients with chronic hypoxemia use oxygen therapy because the cost ($517 per year) is too high. It is necessary to implement a community-based comprehensive intervention, which requires support from national polices, to ensure the availability of medical resources, such as essential drugs, equipment, and human resources, and to improve the affordability of COPD therapy for patients. Continuous educational programs on quality-improving skills and management strategies should be more effective and comprehensive in China to improve health-care quality and physicians' clinical practice skills and to reduce health-care disparities among regions and economic groups.","sha":"79c4b114ab9f9e8070911e38d090446dc700453f","publish_time":"2011-04-30","authors":"Fang, Xiaocong; Wang, Xiangdong; Bai, Chunxue","journal":"Chest","doi":"10.1378\/chest.10-1393","Title":"Chest","H index":267.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"When cor pulmonale deaths with documented COPD history were included, COPD-related mortality increased to 179.9 for men and to 141.3 for women per 100,000 persons.

We hypothesized that structural changes of the lung might correlate with symptoms and pulmonary function. To answer this question, we correlate findings of high-resolution CT (HRCT) with dyspnea scores and results of pulmonary function tests in patients during recovery from SARS. Design: Retrospective follow-up cohort study. Setting: University hospital. Patients: Nineteen patients who recovered from SARS-related hospitalization. Measurements: The study included HRCT scores (0 to 100), dyspnea scores (1 to 4), static and dynamic lung volumes, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Results: The interval between hospital discharge and HRCT study or functional assessment was 31.2 \u060e 4.8 days (range, 25 to 38 days) [mean \u060e SD]. All patients had HRCT abnormalities and were assigned to two groups: ground-glass opacity (GGO) only (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 7, 36.8%) and GGO with fibrosis (GGO\u0609F) [n \u202b\u060d\u202c 12, 63.2%]. Most patients (16 of 19, 84.2%) had no zonal predominance. HRCT scores correlated well with dyspnea scores (r \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.78, p < 0.01) and with a variety of pulmonary functional variables, with DLCO being the most significant (r \u202b\u060d\u202c \u060a 0.923, p < 0.001). Compared with the GGO group, the GGO\u0609F group showed significantly lower FEV 1 , FVC, total lung capacity, residual volume, and DLCO.

[12] [13] [14] Among them, a recent report by Antonio et al 12 described that fibrosis was present in 62% of their symptomatic patients with SARS after discharge, and suggested that fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with more severe disease. However, the extent of disease evaluated by CT and its relationship to functional studies and symptoms in patients during recovery from SARS have not yet been reported. It is therefore important to have a more comprehensive insight into possible clinical outcome of patients with SARS during the recovery period to enable identification of patients who are not recovering at the expected rate.\r\n We hypothesized that structural changes detected by high-resolution CT (HRCT) might correlate with symptoms and pulmonary function. A retrospective study was performed to examine the relationships among HRCT findings, pulmonary symptoms, and lung function in patients with persistent pulmonary symptoms during early recovery from SARS.\r\n From June 1, 2003, to July 25, 2003 , 52 patients with SARS who met specified discharge criteria 12 were discharged from our hospital. The diagnosis leading to their original hospitalization was established based on the CDC definition of SARS. 7 From a review of medical records for discharged patients with SARS, we identified patients who exhibited dyspnea with strenuous activity. All patients who remained symptomatic to this extent underwent HRCT and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) as part of their clinical evaluation. Patients who were not symptomatic could not be scanned for clinical purposes because the National Insurance Policy would not pay for the scans. Along with HRCT scans, patients underwent PFTs during follow-up to evaluate various degrees of persistent respiratory symptoms and form the basis of this study, while the other 33 patients did not have subjective respiratory complaints.\r\n Diagnoses of probable cases of SARS in all patients were based on the CDC criteria, 7 and were confirmed by a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results for SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in either of the following samples as throat swab, serum, or urine collected from the patients. Samples from SARS patients in our institute were sent to the CDC in Taiwan, where RT-PCR was performed using a protocol described in a report by Hsueh et al. 15 As an adjunct for confirming the diagnosis, IgG antibody to the SARS-CoV detected by a standard indirect fluorescence antibody assay with titers \u03fe 1:25 in serum was used to test the samples. This laboratory work was developed later than RT-PCR by the CDC in Taiwan, and was applied to 12 of our 19 patients. Among them, 8 of 12 patients undergoing this test had positive results.\r\n HRCT examinations were performed with a Somatom Plus 4 CT scanner (Siemens; Erlangen, Germany). The scanning parameters were as follows: 2-mm collimation, 140 kilovolt peak, 129 mA, a scanning time of 1 s, and a 350-mm field of view. Images were reconstructed with a high-spatial-resolution algorithm for parenchymal analysis. Scans were obtained at the suspended end-inspiratory volume. All patients were scanned in the supine position, with additional scans obtained in the prone position to avoid physiologic-dependent areas of attenuation in the posterior lung. CT scans were reviewed for this study by two radiology specialists (H.H.H., W.C.C.), who were not aware of the identity of the patients or clinical findings.\r\n Each individual section on the HRCT scans was assessed for the presence, distribution, and extent of pulmonary abnormalities such as ground-glass opacity (GGO), airspace consolidation, and fibrosis. The findings of irregular linear opacities, parenchymal bands, irregular interfaces, lung distortion, and traction bronchiectasis were considered to reflect fibrosis. 16, 17 The distribution of each finding was classified as follows: predominantly in the upper, middle, or lower lung zone, or random; predominantly peripheral, peribronchovascular, or random; and patchy, diffuse, or random. The anatomic distribution was noted to be peripheral if there was a predominance of abnormalities in the outer third of the lung, peribronchovascular if the abnormalities had a close relationship to the bronchovascular bundles, and random if the abnormalities did not clearly fit into either of these categories.\r\n Employing a scoring method similar to one described previously, 18 the extent of involvement was assessed for each of the three lung zones that corresponded to approximately one third of the images from the lung apex to 1 cm below the domes of the diaphragm. The CT score in upper, middle, and lower lung zones was determined by visual estimation of the extent of disease in each zone. The score represented the percentage of lung parenchyma that showed evidence of abnormalities, mainly areas of GGO and fibrosis, estimated to the nearest 10% of parenchymal involvement. The overall percentage of involvement was obtained by averaging the six lung zones by each individual observer. Reproducibility or intraobserver variability of HRCT scoring was determined by correlating readings at the same images twice by two individual observers not aware of any clinical information. Final scores were determined by an average of scores assessed by two observers with a difference within 5%. Readings were repeated when the difference of scores between two observers exceeded 5% until a consensus was reached.\r\n By reviewing the degree of shortness of breath described in the medical records, we graded them into different scores according to a description by Staples et al. 18 The dyspnea score was graded from 1 to 4: 1 \u03ed dyspnea with strenuous activity such as climbing three flights of stairs or heavy housework, 2 \u03ed dyspnea with mild activity such as climbing one flight of stairs or light housework, 3 \u03ed dyspnea with minimal activity such as walking 20 to 50 feet, and 4 \u03ed dyspnea at rest or while eating or talking.\r\n PFTs were performed in our pulmonary function laboratory using standard procedures 19 with the patient sitting in an upright position. The flow volume curve was observed during the maximal FVC maneuver until an accurate flow volume curve was obtained by coaching the patients. Spirometry and lung volumes were measured using a Jaeger Bodyscreen II-Bodybox (Jaeger, Germany) with Masterlab software (ML3; Jaeger). The following parameters were recorded: FEV 1 , FVC with the largest sum of FVC used for analysis, their ratio (FEV 1 \/FVC), forced expiratory flow at 50% (FEF 50 ) of FVC, total lung capacity (TLC), and functional residual capacity (FRC). Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) was determined by the singlebreath carbon monoxide technique using an infrared analyzer (Model 66200; SensorMedics; Yorba Linda, CA).\r\n The Pearson correlation test was used to determine the correlation between two readings of HRCT scores by each observer to determine the reproducibility as well as correlation between HRCT scores and pulmonary function measurements. The correlation between dyspnea and HRCT scores was examined with the Spearman correlation test. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare results of PFTs with dyspnea scores and with different CT patterns.\r\n There were 19 patients who remained symptomatic after discharge (6 men and 13 women; age range, 22 to 65 years; mean \u03ee SD age, 42.5 \u03ee 12.4 years). Each of these patients underwent HRCT scans and PFTs on the same day at follow-up, with an interval ranged from 25 to 38 days (mean \u03ee SD, 31.2 \u03ee 4.8 days) from discharge. There were six patients who progressed to ARDS. All patients were treated with a therapeutic regimen recommended by So et al, 20 including 11 patients with pulse steroid (PS) and 8 patients with nonpulse steroid (NPS). Demographic, clinical data including smoking status, and information of HRCT study are summarized in Table 1 . It was noted that patients who progressed to ARDS had longer hospital stays than those who did not have ARDS (59.2 \u03ee 30.5 days vs 18.4 \u03ee 13.7 days, respectively; p \u03ed 0.0007).\r\n HRCT findings consisted of bilateral patchy areas of GGO alone or accompanied by septal thickening (Fig 1, top) in 7 patients (36.8%), or associated with superimposed areas of fibrosis (Fig  1, bottom) in 12 patients (63.2%). Based on the above-described description, we classified patients into two groups: GGO and GGO with fibrosis (GGO\u03e9F). Six of seven patients (85.7%) who had areas of GGO without fibrosis did not show zonal predominance, and predominant involvement in the middle lung zones was observed in only one patient (14.3%). A random distribution without any central or peripheral predominance was evident in five patients (71.4%), whereas peripheral and peribronchovascular distribution was present in one patient (14.3%). In the GGO\u03e9F group, fibrosis predominantly involved all three lung PS  3  28  GGO\u03e9F  60  9  Male  46  21  19  0  No  NPS  1  29  GGO\u03e9F  9  10  Male  38  12  25  0  No  NPS  3  37  GGO\u03e9F  20  11  Female  22  No  34  9  Yes  PS  4  29  GGO\u03e9F  48  12  Female  42  No  28  0  No  PS  2  32  GGO\u03e9F  42  13  Male  65  No  31  10  No  PS  2  31  GGO\u03e9F  24  14  Female  24  No  17  0  No  NPS  2  25  GGO\u03e9F  5  15  Female  55  No  48  18  Yes  PS  2  35  GGO\u03e9F  50  16  Female  55  No  34  14  No  PS  2  28  GGO\u03e9F  40  17  Female  46  No  27  0  No  NPS  2  38  GGO\u03e9F  30  18  Male  52  20  53  22  Yes  PS  4  25  GGO\u03e9F  90  19  Female  50  No  62  21  Yes  PS  4  26 GGO\u03e9F 95\r\n *All patients with a smoking history were current smokers at the time they became ill. \u2020Interval between hospital discharge and HRCT scan (same as that of PFT). \r\n Dyspnea score correlated well with measurements of a panel of pulmonary function parameters, providing validation for the scoring system used in this study (Fig 2) . HRCT scores correlated well with dyspnea scores (r \u03ed 0.78, p \u03fd 0.001) and various pulmonary function variables (Fig 3) . Results of mean values of all measured functional parameters for the GGO and the GGO\u03e9F groups were listed in Table 2 . Compared with the GGO group, the GGO\u03e9F group showed significantly lower mean values for FEV 1 , FVC, TLC, RV, and Dlco (Fig 4) .\r\n SARS was first reported in southern China in November 2002, 21 and has spread rapidly to many countries over the world. [1] [2] [3] [4] As of late July 2003, the 26 countries affected by SARS reported a cumulative total of 8,439 cases of SARS, 812 of which had resulted in death. 22 In Taiwan, an outbreak began during late April 2003 at a hospital in the city of Taipei and soon spread throughout the whole island. We treated 68 patients at our institution during the Taiwan epidemic, 52 of whom were discharged and are now followed up at our hospital. Recent reports 1,11-14 have demonstrated that CT is a highly sensitive imaging study for the diagnosis SARS, and its patterns have been well described in the acute and early recovery phases. To date, investigation of functional changes that might correlate with structural changes depicted by CT, focusing on those who experience persistent respiratory symptoms during recovery from SARS, has not been reported. We performed a retrospective study correlating pulmonary function and clinical symptoms in a cohort of SARS patients after discharge to develop a more comprehensive insight into their clinical outcomes during the early recovery phase.\r\n Similar to results reported by Antonio et al, 12 patients in this study represented 37% of all discharged SARS patients (19 of 52 patients). Both of these studies have the same limitation as to investigate structural changes of the lung by HRCT only for symptomatic patients of SARS during recovery. It would be interesting to compare symptomatic patients with asymptomatic patients to see whether symptomatic patients have more severe HRCT abnormalities than those of asymptomatic patients. In our study, major findings on HRCT were bilateral patchy areas of GGO with or without fibrosis. These findings were in general agreement with those of Antonio and colleagues. 12 Similar to their finding of fibrosis in 62% of patients, we identified fibrosis in more than half of our patients (12 of 19 patients, 63% ). It is difficult to know how many of these structural changes will resolve by time. In patients with evidence of fibrosis at HRCT, the importance of concomitant presence of ground-glass opacification is not clear. Presumably, areas of ground-glass opacification may represent either residual inflammation that may resolve or may evolve to fibrosis over time. To address this speculation, a longer term of follow-up may be needed. It is believed that pulmonary fibrosis observed at the recovery phase would at least in part account for the respiratory symptoms. Compared with CT findings as a predominant lower lobe and peripheral distribution during the acute phase of SARS reported by Wong et al, 11 we and Antonio et al 12 observed generally no predominance in distribution of pa-renchymal abnormalities. This difference in patterns of CT abnormalities suggests either that structural changes related to SARS evolve over time, or that the underlying pathophysiologic process may resolve at varying rates.\r\n Dyspnea scoring for the evaluation of symptoms was validated by a good correlation with values of pulmonary function parameters. Furthermore, dyspnea scores correlated well with HRCT scores, indicating that pronounced symptoms may be attributed to a more extensive parenchymal involvement. This was further supported by a significant correlation between HRCT scores with a number of pulmonary function parameters that reflects reliably the severity of loss of the functioning lung.\r\n Two groups of patients were identified based on HRCT findings of GGO only or GGO\u03e9F in our study and the study by Antonio et al. 12 We were 26 suggested that the predominant feature of lung injury was diffuse alveolar damage with varying degrees of fibrin deposition within the peripheral airways. They concluded that the lung histology varied according to duration of illness. In their studies, cases with a time course \u03fe 10 days showed an organizing phase of diffuse alveolar damage and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. CT findings of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia are well characterized, [27] [28] [29] and are similar to those of SARS. 11 Taken together, results from previous pathologic and image studies, we speculate that a possible small airway dysfunction reflected by our pulmonary function study may be attributed to a possible presence of small airway obstruction within the area of GGO. In addition, GGO\u03e9F may reflect a repair process accompanying the parenchymal inflammation at varying phases of SARS, or may be a more extensive form of SARS-related lung injury reflected by a more pronounced functional impairment, as we have demonstrated.\r\n The lung damage in SARS is believed to be associated with a cytokine storm elicited by viral antigen of the SARS-CoV, which may share a common pathogenesis of acute lung injury as part of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. 12 The need of corticosteroid to treat SARS reflects the nature of SARS-related lung injury elicited by a cytokine storm. A recent report by Ho et al 30 showed that PS therapy appeared to be a more efficacious and equally safe steroid regimen as compared with low-dose NPS in the acute stage of SARS. In contrast, we and Antonio et al 12 em-ployed a standard treatment protocol for SARS for adults recommended by So et al. 20 All of our patients were treated with methylprednisolone in addition to the use of ribavirin and broad-spectrum antibiotics as diagnosis of SARS was confirmed. Unlike study reported by Ho et al, 30 who divided their regimens of corticosteroid therapy into PS and NPS at the beginning of treatment for SARS, we administered PS only if the clinical condition worsened with deteriorating chest radiographic findings and decreasing oxygenation saturation. In our study, patients who had more pronounced HRCT abnormalities or worse PFTs results were virtually treated with PS because of a rapid deterioration of their clinical condition. It is therefore difficult to determine whether PS therapy was more efficacious than NPS based on our results. A prospective randomized trial and longterm follow-up of structural and functional changes of the lung is needed to determine whether PS is indeed superior to NPS in treating patients with SARS.\r\n Recent reports 3, 5 have shown that approximately 25 to 38% of patients with SARS progressed to ARDS. ARDS reflects the most severe form of SARS, which leads to a mortality rate of 48%, similar to that of ARDS in patients with other types of pneumonia, and in patients with SARS who required critical care. 31 Notably, the medical response to SARS-related ARDS extends well beyond intensive care for ARDS caused by other etiology, as it involves an overwhelming public health issue. 32 Viral pneumonia usually resolves without any clinical or radiologic sequelae, 33 whereas SARS-related respiratory sequelae appeared to be quite common among its survivors as observed by us and others. 12, 14 Intriguingly, follow-up CT scans of ARDS survivors other than SARS tend to be limited in extent, and usually show a predominance in ventral distribution of fibrosis and parenchymal opacification, 34, 35 whereas pulmonary abnormalities of SARS-related ARDS appear random in their distribution and are usually extensive. A restrictive type of functional impairment and decreased Dlco in ARDS survivors has been described by previous reports. 36, 37 However, Neff and colleagues 38 reported recently that residual combined restrictive and obstructive type of functional impairment remained common in survivors of severe ARDS treated in surgical intensive unit. In general, lung volume and spirometric measurements returned to normal in most of the patients over time, 37 but Dlco remained low in long-term follow-up. 36 -38 These results suggest that persistent decrease in Dlco reflects a permanent parenchymal damage of the lung as fibrosis in ARDS patients. Similarly, our evaluation on SARS-related functional changes in early recovery phase showed a restrictive defect and significantly decreased Dlco. It would be interesting to compare structural and functional changes in survivors of SARS-related ARDS during late recovery with those of ARDS survivors not related to SARS by a similar follow-up protocol.\r\n We combined correlation studies of CT with clinical and functional parameters for patients during recovery from SARS. In this study, we demonstrated that HRCT analysis correlated well with functional studies and clinical symptoms with the most significant correlation with Dlco. In addition, all patients in our study showed restrictive functional impairment. Our results suggest a potential role of HRCT and pulmonary function testing to track respiratory sequelae related with SARS. Longer-duration follow-up studies in a larger cohort of patients should be performed to investigate the long-term clinical outcome of patients recovering from SARS.","sha":"9b2b2560c7372956ac851ab78c8a72cc5dde24d7","publish_time":"2004-07-31","authors":"Hsu, Hsian-He; Tzao, Ching; Wu, Chin-Pyng; Chang, Wei-Chou; Tsai, Chen-Liang; Tung, Ho-Jui; Chen, Cheng-Yu","journal":"Chest","doi":"10.1378\/chest.126.1.149","Title":"Chest","H index":267.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria 7 were hospitalized, 84 of whom died. 12] [13] [14] Among them, a recent report by Antonio et al 12 described that fibrosis was present in 62% of their symptomatic patients with SARS after discharge, and suggested that fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with more severe disease. It is therefore important to have a more comprehensive insight into possible clinical outcome of patients with SARS during the recovery period to enable identification of patients who are not recovering at the expected rate. We hypothesized that structural changes detected by high-resolution CT (HRCT) might correlate with symptoms and pulmonary function. From June 1, 2003, to July 25, 2003 , 52 patients with SARS who met specified discharge criteria 12 were discharged from our hospital. Samples from SARS patients in our institute were sent to the CDC in Taiwan, where RT-PCR was performed using a protocol described in a report by Hsueh et al. Among them, 8 of 12 patients undergoing this test had positive results. HRCT examinations were performed with a Somatom Plus 4 CT scanner (Siemens; Erlangen, Germany). Images were reconstructed with a high-spatial-resolution algorithm for parenchymal analysis. Scans were obtained at the suspended end-inspiratory volume. All patients were scanned in the supine position, with additional scans obtained in the prone position to avoid physiologic-dependent areas of attenuation in the posterior lung. Each individual section on the HRCT scans was assessed for the presence, distribution, and extent of pulmonary abnormalities such as ground-glass opacity (GGO), airspace consolidation, and fibrosis. Final scores were determined by an average of scores assessed by two observers with a difference within 5%. The flow volume curve was observed during the maximal FVC maneuver until an accurate flow volume curve was obtained by coaching the patients. The Pearson correlation test was used to determine the correlation between two readings of HRCT scores by each observer to determine the reproducibility as well as correlation between HRCT scores and pulmonary function measurements.

There is a strong association between ventilation, environmental air movements, and the airborne transmission of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).4 Since respiratory therapy may generate infective aerosols, there is potential risk that treatment may result in a superspreading event among patients and health-care workers in close contact. The use of a jet nebulizer driven by air at 6 Umin for the administration of aerosolized salbutamol in an index patient had probably enhanced the spread of SARS, leading to a major nosocomial outbreak in our hospital in 2003. 5--7 We have reported the dispersion distances of exhaled air, as marked by smoke particles, during application of oxygen therapy via a simple mask and during noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV).Il-1O As part of our influenza pandemic preparedness, we studied dispersion distances of exhaled air and aerosolized droplets during application of a jet nebulizer to a human patient simulator (HPS) programmed to breathe at normal lung condition and at different degrees of lung injury. We hypothesized that as lung compliance deteriorated with worsening lung injury, there would be more extensive leakage through the side vents of the jet nebulizer.\r\n The experiments were conducted in an isolation room that measured 2.8 X 4.22 X 2.4 m, with 12 air exchanges per hour (Fig 1) . This is one ofthe 36, double-door, negative pressure (-5 Pa) isolation rooms specifically constructed on the top floor ofthe hospital after the major outbreak of SARS5 to facilitate management of patients with highly infectious diseases. The experimental design and method of data analysis have been described in details in our previous studies 8-10 on exhaled air dispersion related to NPPV and Simple oxygen mask. In this study, we examined the extent of exhaled air leakage through the side vents of the jet nebulizer (Salter Labs; Arvin, CAl attached to a high-fidelity HPS (HPS 6.1; Medical Education Technologies Inc.; Sarasota, FL). The jet nebulizer had a built-in air pump driven by a constant flow of air at 6 Umin for the purpose of the study. The nebulizer reservoir was filled with sterile water.\r\n The HPS contains a realistic airway and a lung model that undergoes gas exchange (ie, it removes oxygen and adds carbon dioxide to the system). Lung compliance and airway resistance also respond in a realistic manner to relevant challenges. In addition, the HPS produces an airflow pattern that is close to the in vivo human situation, and has been applied in previous studiesI 1-15 to simulate human respiration. The simulator represented a 70-kg adult male sitting on a 45\u00b0-inclined hospital bed.\r\n In this study, we programmed lung compliance and oxygen consumption of the HPS to mimic three different lung conditions: normal, mild lung injury, and severe lung injury ( Table l)yu7 cross-section of the entire leakage jet plume through the nebulizer side vents alongthe coronal plane lateralto the HPS. nus allowed us to investigate the regions directly above and lateralto the mask and the patient. All leakage jet plume images revealed by the laser light sheet were captured by the high-definition video camera positioned at the end of the bed directIy opposite to the HPS.Smoke concentration in the plumewasestimatedfromthe lightscatteredby smoke particles (Fig 2) .8-10\r\n We estimated normalized smoke concentration in the mask leakage air from the light scattered by the particles. In short, the thin laser light sheet of near-constant intensityilluminated smoke particle markers in the mask airflow leakage. Smoke particles scattered laser light perpendicular to the light sheet, and thiswas collected and integrated by the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)video camera element and lens. s -IO This analysis was based on scattered light intensity being proportional to particle concentration under the special conditionsof constant intensity laser light sheet illumination and monodisperse, small (submicrometer) particles.IS\r\n The motion video of several breathing cycles for a given lung model setting was captured to a computer and individualframes extractedas gray scalebitmaps for intensityanalysis.

The background intensity image was subtracted from each frame pixel by pixel to remove any stray FIGURE 2. A jet nebulizer was attached to a high-fidelity HPS with a laser Iiliht sheet shining from the left side of the simulator at the coronal plane.

The resulting image was the total intensity of light scattered perpendicular to the light sheet by the smoke particles and was directIy proportional to smoke concentration. The imagewas normalized against the highest intensity found within the leakage jet plume to generate nonnalizedparticleconcentration contours. S -IO\r\n The leakagejet plume consistsof a combinationof pulmonary smoke and the aerosolized medication. The leakage plume of \"unused\" aerosolized medications from the jet nebulizer should also be considered as infective because it mixeswith the exhaled air before it escapes through the side vents of the nebulizer mask. As the smoke particles mark air that originates from the HPS airways, before leaking from the mask, the concentration contours effectively represent the probability of encountering exhaled air and the aerosolizedmedication around the patient that has come from within the mask and\/or the patient's respiratory system. The smoke concentration contours are made up of data collected from 10 breaths. A contour value of 1 indicates a region that consistsentirelyof air exhaled by the patient, where there is a veryhighchance of exposure to the exhaled air, such as at the mask exhaust vents.A valuenear 0 indicates no measurable air leabgein the regionand a smallchanceof exposure to the exhaled air. 8 -10 The study received nonionizing radiation and biologicallchemical safety approval bythe Chinese University of Hong Kong.\r\n As the exhalation smoke jet was noted to leak through the side vents of the nebulizer mask, we therefore presented the lateral distances of air particle dispersion with reference to the coronal plane (Fig 3, top left) . The dispersion distances increased with worsening lung injury.\r\n At normal lung condition (oxygen consumption, 200 mUmin; lung compliance, 70 mUcm H 2 0 ), the average respiratory rate was 12 breaths\/min and tidal volume was 700 mL. The maximum dispersion distance of smoke particles, defined as the boundary with a region encountering < 5% concentration of exhaled smoke particles (light blue contour), was 0.45 m, whereas the dispersion distance of a high concentration of smoke particles (white and red zone and above) was 0.2 m (Fig 3, top right) . In mild lung injury (oxygenconsumption, 300 mUmin; lung compliance, 35 mUcm H 2 0 ; respiratory rate, 25 breaths\/ min; tidal volume, 300 mL), the maximum dispersion distance of a low concentration of smoke particles increased to 0.54 m, whereas that of a high concentration was 0.15 m (Fig 3, bottom left) .\r\n In severe lung injury (oxygen consumption, 500 mUmin; lung compliance, 10 mUcm H 2 0 ; respiratory rate, 40 breaths\/min; tidal volume, 150 mL), a larger and more diffuse exhalation jet leaked through the side vents of the nebulizer mask was noted, probably due to its gravitational effect. Although the exhalation distance of a high concentration of smoke particles (eg, red zone on scale) was < 0.1 m, the maximum dispersion distance extended beyond Original Research The white color code and the red color code represented regions consisting of 100% and 70%, respectively, of smoke particles, whereas the background of the isolation room (deep blue code) was free of smoke particles. Bottom lett: The simulator was programmed to mimic mild lung injury with oxygen consumption of 300 mUmin, lung compliance of 35 mUcm H 20, respiratory rate of 25 breaths\/min, and tidal volume of 300 mL. The maximum exhalation distance of a lowconcentration of smokeparticles iJicreased to 0.54 m, whereasthat of a high concentration was 0.15 m. Bottom right: The simulator was programmed to mimic severelung injurywith oxygen consumption of 500 mUmin, l~compliance of 10 mUcm H 2 0 , respiratory rate of 40 breaths\/min, and tidal volume of 150 mL. Although the exhalation distance of a high concentration of smoke particles (red zone) was < 0.1 m, that of a low concentration of smoke particles was noted to extendbeyond0.8 m as a result of more extensive leakage throughthe nebulizersideventsof the nebulizermask, with a projectile shape due to gravitational effect. 0.8 m due to more extensive leakage through the nebulizer side vents (Fig 3, bottom right) . DISCUSSION With an extremely fine smoke particle tracer in order to demonstrate the maximum distribution of exhaled air, this study investigated the dispersion distances of exhaled air particles during application of a jet nebulizer under normal lung condition vs www.chestjoumal.org different degrees of lung injury in our hospital isolation room with negative pressure. Using laser smoke visualizationmethods, we have shown that the maximum dispersion distance of a low concentration of air particles increased from 0.45 m at normal lung condition to 0.54 m and beyond 0.8 m during mild and severe lung injury, respectively. Interestingly, the dispersion of high-concentration smoke particles was reduced with worsening lung injury. These data suggest that the dispersion of exhaled air during application of jet nebulizer is determined by both the CHEST \/135\/3\/ MARCH, 2009 expiratory effort and the leakage of \"unused\" aerosolized droplets through the exhalation ports of the jet nebulizer. In this regard, exhaled air from the lungs contained high concentration of smoke particles and was dispersed according to expiratory flow. Therefore, the dispersion distance of high-concentration smoke particles was significantly reduced by > 40% as the tidal volume was decreased from 700 to 150 mL. In contrast, the extent of leakage ofaerosolized droplets was inversely proportional to the tidal volume. Although aerosol deposition within the simulated patient does not model deposition within a real lung, much of the aerosolized medication was deposited within the simulated patient during inspiration, and the amount of leakage was therefore less in normal lung condition than in the severe lung injury model. Although the leakage of aerosolized droplets carried only small amount of exhaled smoke particles, these were responsible for dispersing Iowconcentration smoke particles to a longer distance in severe lung injury. These findings have important clinical implications to the hea1th-care workers who often manage patients with respiratory failure and febrile illness of unknown etiology at a close distance. It is important to provide adequate respiratory protection for health-care workers in addition to applying standard, contact, and droplet precautions in order to prevent nosocomial infections.\r\n The jet nebulizer is an aerosol-generating device commonly used to deliver aerosolized bronchodilation to patients with airway diseases and pneumonia. It was implicated as the cause of a major hospital outbreak of SARS in 2003.5--7 While the major routes for transmission of SARS were related to infected droplets and fomites, as is usually the case in viral pneumonia,20 there was evidence that SARS might have spread by airborne transmission. 21 -24 It was not entirely clear if different modalities of respiratory support had contributed to the nosocomial outbreaks of SARS through generation of infective aerosols.\r\n Our previous studies 9 \u2022 10 have shown that the maximum exhaled air dispersion distances from patients receiving oxygen via a Hudson mask and during NPPV were 0.4 m and 0.45 m, respectively. A case-control study25 involving 124 medical wards in 26 hospitals in Guangzhou and Hong Kong has identified SARS patients requiring oxygentherapy or NPPVas independent risk factors for superspreading nosocomial outbreaks of SARS.\r\n Our previous study9 has shown an exhaled air dispersion distance of 0.22 m from the simple oxygen mask when oxygen was delivered at 6 Umin to the HPS with mild lung injury. The current study has shown that the jet nebulizer system driven by air at 6 Umin can extend the dispersion distance much further, especially in the presence of more severe lung injury ( Table 2) .\r\n Apart from aerosol-generating procedures, environmental factors such as medical ward airflow and ventilation play a significant role in the aerosol transmission of infection in health-care premises.\" A recent review4 has demonstrated a strong association between ventilation, air movements in buildings, and the transmission\/spread of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, influenza, and SARS, but there are insufficient data to specify and quantify the minimum ventilation requirements in hospitals and isolation rooms in relation to spread of infectious diseases via the airborne route. In a stud y 27 of the dispersion characteristics of polydispersed droplets in a general hospital ward equipped with ceilingmixing type ventilation system, the small droplets or droplet nuclei (initial size S 45 J.Lm) behaved as airborne transmittable particles (staying airborne for > 360 s) and the dispersions were strongly affected by the ward ventilation airflow pattern. The expiratory droplets exhibited an initial rapid dispersion followed by slower dispersion in the subsequent stage. In contrast, large droplets (with initial size This study has applied smoke particles as markers for exhaled air in the HPS model because there is no safe and reliable marker that can be introduced into human lungs for study.8-10 The inertia and weight of larger droplets in an air droplet two-phase flow would certainly cause them to have less horizontal dispersion than the continuous air carrier phase in which they travel. However, evaporation of water content in some respiratory droplets during the jet nebulizer therapy would produce droplet nuclei suspended in air, whereas the larger droplets would fall to the ground in a trajectory pathway due to gravitational effects. A droplet nucleus is the airborne residue of a potentially infectious aerosol from which most of the liquid has evaporated and may have diameter < 10~m.4.26 Asthe smoke particles in this study mark the continuous air phase, our data contours are referring to exhaled air and droplet nuclei (including the aerosolized medication) rather than the risk of large droplet transmission.sJ? However, we could not capture the full air-dispersion distance in severe lung injury because we were unable to position the laser team far away from the HPS due to the small size of the isolation room.\r\n When an infected person coughs or sneezes, respiratory droplets are released. In addition to maintaining contact, droplet, and standard precautions among the health-care workers when providing routine care to patients infected with H5Nl influenza, the World Health Organization 28 currently recommends airborne precautions in health-care facilities, including placing patients with suspected and confirmed H5Nl influenza in isolation rooms with at least 12 air exchanges per hour (if available) during aerosol-generating procedures due to the high lethality of the disease and uncertainty about the mode of human-to-human transmission. The negative pressure room will reduce the spread of airborne contamination between rooms. The air-exchange rate and airflow patterns are important factors in the control of airborne virus infection, and good ventilation arrangement may enhance the safety of staff when performing medical treatments within isolation rooms.P? In health-care facilities where negative pressure isolation room is not available, an alternative is to administer bronchodilator to high-risk patients in the form of a metered-dose inhaler via a spacer or in dry powder formulation because these methods have equivalent efficacy to the jet nebulizer in relieving bronchospasm due to acute asthma. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] In summary, this study has shown that substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs at least within 0.8 m from patients receiving treatment via a jet nebulizer www.chelItjoumal.org in an isolation room with negative pressure. Healthcare workers should take special precautions when caring for patients with febrile respiratory illness requiring treatment via a jet nebulizer.","sha":"110f1d8e7cfc045022c195d0025270b51e027d15","publish_time":"2009-03-31","authors":"Hui, David S.; Chow, Benny K.; Chu, Leo C.Y.; Ng, Susanna S.; Hall, Stephen D.; Gin, Tony; Chan, Matthew T.V.","journal":"Chest","doi":"10.1378\/chest.08-1998","Title":"Chest","H index":267.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Table I \r\n Visualization of airflow around the nebulizer mask was facilitated by marking air with smoke particles produced by a smoke generator (M-6000, NI9; DS Electronics; Sydney, Australia) as in our previous studies.

Lung compliance and airway resistance also respond in a realistic manner to relevant challenges. nus allowed us to investigate the regions directly above and lateralto the mask and the patient.

The dispersion distances increased with worsening lung injury. At normal lung condition (oxygen consumption, 200 mUmin; lung compliance, 70 mUcm H 2 0 ), the average respiratory rate was 12 breaths\/min and tidal volume was 700 mL. The maximum dispersion distance of smoke particles, defined as the boundary with a region encountering < 5% concentration of exhaled smoke particles (light blue contour), was 0.45 m, whereas the dispersion distance of a high concentration of smoke particles (white and red zone and above) was 0.2 m (Fig 3, top right) . In this regard, exhaled air from the lungs contained high concentration of smoke particles and was dispersed according to expiratory flow. These findings have important clinical implications to the hea1th-care workers who often manage patients with respiratory failure and febrile illness of unknown etiology at a close distance. The current study has shown that the jet nebulizer system driven by air at 6 Umin can extend the dispersion distance much further, especially in the presence of more severe lung injury ( Table 2) .

We, therefore, have studied its concentrations in the sputum and plasma of patients with COPD and patients with pulmonary TB (PTB), and further investigated the mechanism-of-action effects of IL-27 on bronchial epithelial cells in vitro . Methods: Human bronchial epithelial cells grown on air-liquid interface culture were activated by IL-27, alone, or in combination with other infl ammatory cytokines in the presence or absence of various signaling molecule inhibitors. The expression of CXCL10 was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The underlying signaling pathways were studied by intracellular staining using fl ow cytometry, Western blot, ELISA, or siRNA. Results: Signifi cantly higher sputum and plasma concentrations of IL-27 were found in patients with COPD (n 5 34; P , .01 and P , .001, respectively) or patients with PTB (n 5 31; P , .01 and P , .001, respectively) than in healthy control subjects (n 5 48). Sputum, but not plasma, IL-27 levels in patients with COPD correlated negatively with FEV 1 ( r 5 2 0.51, P , .01). Sputum, but not plasma, IL-27 in patients with PTB correlated positively with mycobacterial load in sputum ( r 5 0.48, P , .05). Further in vitro studies demonstrated that IL-27 could induce gene and protein expression of CXCL10 in bronchial epithelial cells, which was regulated by the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway. Conclusions: The production of IL-27 is related to the pathogenesis of COPD and PTB, and IL-27 induces the expression of CXCL10 in bronchial epithelial cells through the activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

[3] [4] [5] IL-27 is a pleiotropic cytokine consisting of EBI3 and p28 subunits. 6 It is an early product of activated antigen-presenting cells stimulated by toll-like receptor ligands or infectious agents. [7] [8] [9] IL-27 could drive the differentiation of the T helper (Th) cell type 1 (Th1) subset in the early stage of development, [6] [7] [8] and support germinal center function by enhancing IL-21 production and the function of follicular Th cells. 10 IL-27 is able to stimulate monocytes, mast cells, and keratinocytes to produce a variety of proinfl ammatory cytokines. 9, 11 In addition, IL-27 exhibits antitumor activity by promoting effector responses of CD8 1 T cells and natural killer cells. 12, 13 On the other hand, IL-27 plays an immunoregulatory role in suppressing the development of the Th1, Th2, and (approval No. 20080156) , and informed consent was obtained from all participants according to the Declaration of Helsinki.\r\n Sputum was induced and taken according to the protocols described previously. 18 Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid venous peripheral blood was also collected to obtain plasma. All sputum and plasma were stored at 2 80\u00b0C until analysis. The duration of time between sputum or plasma sampling and protein analysis of patient samples was \u0545 2 months.\r\n Recombinant human IL-1 b , IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17F, IL-23, IL-27, interferon (IFN)-g , and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a were purchased from R&D Systems.

PI3K p110 g inhibitor AS604850 and PI3K p110 d inhibitor IC87114 were purchased from Merck Biosciences. In all studies, the concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was 0.1% (vol\/vol).\r\n Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) were purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories and cultured in bronchial epithelial cell growth medium as described previously. 19 BEAS-2B cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and they were used instead of PBEC for effi cient transfection.\r\n The sequences of PCR primers are described in Table 1 . The level of CXCL10 gene expression was quantifi ed by calculating the ratio of densitometric readings of the band intensity for CXCL10 and G3PDH from the same complementary DNA sample.\r\n The concentrations of IL-27, CXCL8, and IFN-g were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reagents from R&D Systems.

[15] [16] [17] Because activated macrophages and dendritic cells are the main sources of IL-27, 7 there might be an aberrant production of IL-27 in patients with COPD and PTB. However, its immunopathologic role in airway infl ammation and its relationship to airway infl ammatory diseases have not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate IL-27 production in sputum and plasma obtained from patients with COPD and patients with PTB and to study how it activates human bronchial epithelial cells in airway infl ammatory diseases.\r\n Patients and healthy smoking and nonsmoking control subjects were enrolled in this study. Patients with COPD were diagnosed using the criteria of the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease). Patients with COPD who had an exacerbation during the 3 months prior to the visit were excluded. Patients with COPD who had used corticosteroids, theophylline, long-acting b 2 -agonists, leukotriene antagonists, or antihistamines within the 3 months prior to the study were excluded, as were subjects who had histories of respiratory tract infection within the previous 2 months. The patients with PTB presented a clinical manifestation typical for Mycobacterium tuberculosis , which includes radiologic analysis, sputum smears, and culture positivity confi rmed by bacteriologic examination. All patients with PTB were newly diagnosed, and no patient was treated with antiinfl ammatory drugs such as nonsteroidal antiinfl ammatory drugs, steroids, or others. The protocol medications for COPD were inhaled corticosteroids (21 patients), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (18 patients), and long-acting b 2 -agonists (19 patients) . No patients with COPD were receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy. The newly diagnosed patients with PTB were treated with a standard short-course anti-TB chemotherapy consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.\r\n Compared with healthy nonsmokers or smokers with normal lung function, sputum IL-27 was significantly elevated in patients with COPD ( P , .01) and patients with PTB ( P , .01) ( Fig 1A ) . In addition, the levels of plasma IL-27 in patients with COPD and patients with PTB were signifi cantly elevated compared with those of healthy nonsmokers ( P , .001) and healthy smokers ( P , .001) ( Fig 1B ) . However, there was no signifi cant correlation between sputum and plasma IL-27 levels in patients with COPD or those with PTB (data not shown).\r\n Five patients with COPD and six patients with PTB were recruited after treatment for 8 weeks, and sputum concentrations of IL-27 showed reproducibility and the percentage change in IL-27 values was \u0545 10% in patients with COPD ( Fig 1C ) . However, sputum IL-27 levels decreased in all six patients with PTB by week 8, and the percentage change in IL-27 levels was . 30% ( Fig 1D ) . IL-27 levels in plasma showed kinetics similar to those observed in sputum (data not shown).\r\n Sputum IL-27 concentrations in patients with COPD were negatively correlated with FEV 1 % predicted ( r 5 2 0.51, P , .01) ( Fig 1E ) .

Non-parametric Spearman rank correlation coeffi cient was used to test correlations between two parameters. P , .05 was considered signifi cantly different.\r\n A total of 113 subjects (34 smokers with COPD, 31 nonsmokers with PTB, 26 healthy smokers, and 22 healthy nonsmokers) were recruited for this study, and the clinical characteristics of the subjects are summarized in Table 2 . The concomitant ( Fig 2D ) . However, IL-27 could not induce the expression of IL-6, TNF-a , or CXCL8 in PBEC (data not shown).\r\n As shown in Figure 3 , stimulation of PBEC with each of the fi ve cytokines IL-27, IFN-g , IL-1 b , TNF-a , and IL-17F induced the production of CXCL10. However, IL-4 and IL-13 and other IL-6\/IL-12 family cytokines, including IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23, could not activate PBEC to express CXCL10. Furthermore, the combination of IL-27 and each of the four cytokines (IFN-g , IL-1 b , TNF-a , and IL-17F) significantly augmented CXCL10 production in comparison with that observed in PBEC activated by IL-27.\r\n The cytotoxicities of signaling molecule inhibitors on PBEC have been determined by 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was detected between sputum IL-27 and sputum CXCL8 in patients with COPD ( r 5 0.40) (data not shown). In addition, plasma IL-27 was not correlated with any clinical indices, such as smoking status and lung function tests (data not shown). In patients with PTB, a positive correlation was observed between sputum IL-27 levels and mycobacterial load (as assessed by log CFU) in induced sputum ( r 5 0.48, P , .05) ( Fig 1G ) . However, there was no detectable correlation between plasma IL-27 levels and mycobacterial load in induced sputum ( r 5 0.25) (data not shown). In addition, no signifi cant correlation was detected between sputum IL-27 levels and sputum IFN-g ( r 5 0.32) (data not shown).\r\n As shown in Figures 2A and 2B , IL-27 could induce CXCL10 gene expression in PBEC time dependently and dose dependently. In addition, the protein levels of CXCL10 in cell lysates were signifi cantly increased, and peaked at the 12-h time point after stimulation with 10 and 100 ng\/mL of IL-27 ( Fig 2C ) , whereas the levels of CXCL10 in the supernatants peaked at \r\n IL-27 could induce the phosphorylation of PI3K ( Fig 5A ) and Akt ( Fig 5B ) by intracellular fl uorescence staining using fl ow cytometry. PI3K-Akt activation was highly reproducibly detectable in PBEC in response to IL-27 by means of ELISA and Western blot analyses ( Fig 5C, 5D ) .\r\n siRNA-PI3K p110 a , siRNA-PI3K p110 b , and siRNA-Akt Suppressed IL-27-Induced CXCL10 Expression BEAS-2B cells were transfected with siRNA specifi c for PI3K p110 a , PI3K p110 b , and Akt, and Western blot analysis showed that the expression of PI3K p110 a and PI3K p110 b was completely inhibited by PI3K p110 a -and PI3K p110 b -specifi c siRNA, respectively ( Fig 6A, 6B ). In addition, the phosphorylation of Akt was signifi cantly reduced by knockdown of PI3K p110 a (by about 85%) and PI3K p110 b (by about 70%) ( Fig 6C ) .\r\n As shown in Figures 6D and 6E , the induction of CXCL10 gene and protein expression by IL-27 was signifi cantly inhibited in BEAS-2B cells transfected with siRNA for PI3K p110 a , PI3K p110 b , and Akt.\r\n In this study, we demonstrated for the fi rst time that sputum and plasma levels of IL-27 were signifi cantly elevated in COPD and PTB patients compared with assay (data not shown), and the specifi cities of these inhibitors on their signaling pathways have been investigated largely by using different cell types, including PBECs. [19] [20] [21] Following previous studies and toxicity threshold values from the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, we selected the optimal concentrations of Janus kinase inhibitor AG490 (5 m M), NF-k B inhibitor BAY11-7082 (0.8 m M), PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 m M), extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor U0126 (10 m M), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB203580 (20 m M), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 (5 m M) with signifi cant inhibitory effects but without any cell toxicity. As shown in Figure 4A , LY294002 could signifi cantly suppress IL-27-induced CXCL10 production in PBEC, whereas treatment with AG490, BAY11-7082, SB203580, SP600125, and U0126 did not affect CXCL10 release.\r\n To avoid any nonspecifi c effects of this concentration of LY294002 (10 m M), lower concentrations of this compound were used. As shown in Figure 4B , LY294002 (1 m M) could also signifi cantly downregulate IL-27-induced CXCL10 production. Even at the concentration of 0.5 m M of LY294002, IL-27induced CXCL10 production was reduced, although it did not reach statistical signifi cance. However, selective inhibition of PI3K p110 g by AS604850 or PI3K p110 d by IC87114 had no effect on IL-27stimulated CXCL10 release ( Fig 4B ) . enhance the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on the surface of bronchial epithelial cells, 19 we took bronchial epithelial cells as an in vitro cell model to study the potential role of IL-27 in the induction of cytokine and chemokine in bronchial epithelial cells. We found that IL-27 was able to induce the expression of CXCL10 but not IL-6, TNF-a , or CXCL8, which is consistent with previous reports that IL-27 could stimulate the production of CXCL10 in monocytes, keratinocytes, and fi broblast-like synoviocytes. 9, 22, 23 In fact, CXCL10 is a pivotal chemokine that contributes to both Th1-and Th2-type airway infl ammation, 24,25 and a signifi cantly increased production of CXCL10 has been seen in airway infl ammatory diseases such as COPD, PTB, chronic bronchitis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome. [26] [27] [28] [29] In this study, we found that IL-27 is a novel inducer of healthy control subjects. In addition, sputum, but not plasma, IL-27 concentrations in COPD showed a significant correlation with FEV 1 , suggesting a possible link to disease severity. However, sputum IL-27 was not correlated with residual volume\/total lung capacity, indicating that IL-27 may not be associated with alveolar wall destruction in COPD. In addition, sputum, but not plasma, IL-27 was correlated with mycobacterial load in sputum in patients with PTB, suggesting that IL-27 in sputum may refl ect the intensity of TB infection. Additional COPD and PTB patients are currently being recruited to further evaluate the sputum and plasma conversion of IL-27 and the response to antiinfl ammation therapies.\r\n Because bronchial epithelial cells are central participants in the pathogenesis of airway infl ammatory diseases and we have recently found that IL-27 could Regarding signaling pathways of IL-27, we demonstrated that IL-27-induced CXCL10 expression in bronchial epithelial cells is primarily regulated by the PI3K-Akt pathway. Furthermore, both PI3K p110 a and PI3K p110 b isoforms were important for IL-27induced CXCL10 expression, whereas PI3K p110 g and PI3K p110 d had little effect. These results are reasonable because PI3K p110 a and PI3K p110 b are widely distributed, whereas PI3K p110 g and PI3K p110 d are enriched only in leukocytes. [32] [33] [34] However, inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway could partially suppress the expression of CXCL10 induced by IL-27 in bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting that other unidentifi ed signaling pathways might contribute to CXCL10 expression.\r\n Taken together, our results provide evidence that IL-27 might play an important role in airway infl ammatory diseases including COPD and PTB. IL-27 was found to induce the expression of chemokine CXCL10 in bronchial epithelial cells via the activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Elucidating the interactions between IL-27 and CXCL10 may be important in understanding and treating airway infl ammatory diseases. CXCL10 in bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting that the IL-27-CXCL10 axis may be particularly important in the development of airway infl ammation.\r\n Other cytokines, including IFN-g , IL-17F, IL-1 b , and TNF-a have also been described as being able to induce the production of CXCL10. 30, 31 We, therefore, further investigated whether IL-27 could modulate the production of CXL10 in bronchial epithelial cells stimulated with either a Th1 cytokine (IFN-g ), Th17 cytokine (IL-17F), Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13), proinfl ammatory cytokines (IL-1 b and TNF-a ), or other IL-6\/IL-12 family cytokines (IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23). We demonstrated that IL-27 could augment CXCL10 production from bronchial epithelial cells in combination with other infl ammatory cytokines, including IFN-g , IL-1 b , TNF-a , and IL-17F. However, IL-4, IL-13, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23 could not activate bronchial epithelial cells to produce CXCL10. This may be because the stimulation of bronchial epithelial cells by these cytokines could not provide an integrated response by activating CXCL10 gene transcription and protein translation via transcription factors, chromatin phosphorylation, and increasing nucleotide synthesis.

[ 19] [20] [21] Following previous studies and toxicity threshold values from the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, we selected the optimal concentrations of Janus kinase inhibitor AG490 (5 m M), NF-k B inhibitor BAY11-7082 (0.8 m M), PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 m M), extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor U0126 (10 m M), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB203580 (20 m M), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 (5 m M) with signifi cant inhibitory effects but without any cell toxicity. As shown in Figure 4B , LY294002 (1 m M) could also signifi cantly downregulate IL-27-induced CXCL10 production. We found that IL-27 was able to induce the expression of CXCL10 but not IL-6, TNF-a , or CXCL8, which is consistent with previous reports that IL-27 could stimulate the production of CXCL10 in monocytes, keratinocytes, and fi broblast-like synoviocytes. Elucidating the interactions between IL-27 and CXCL10 may be important in understanding and treating airway infl ammatory diseases. We demonstrated that IL-27 could augment CXCL10 production from bronchial epithelial cells in combination with other infl ammatory cytokines, including IFN-g , IL-1 b , TNF-a , and IL-17F. However, IL-4, IL-13, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23 could not activate bronchial epithelial cells to produce CXCL10.

Viral pneumonia constitutes a portion of these cases, and often the viral etiology goes undiagnosed. Emerging viral infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza present with acute FRIs progressing to respiratory failure and ARDS. Therefore, early recognition of a viral cause of acute FRI leading to ARDS becomes important for protection of health-care workers (HCWs), lessening spread to other patients, and notification of public health officials. These patients often have longer courses of viral shedding and undergo higher-risk procedures that may potentially generate aerosols, such as intubation, bronchoscopy, bag-valve mask ventilation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and medication nebulization, further illustrating the importance of early detection and isolation. A small number of viral agents lead to acute FRI, respiratory failure, and ARDS: seasonal influenza, avian influenza, coronavirus associated with severe ARDS, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, varicella, human metapneumovirus, and hantavirus.

[5] [6] [7] Early recognition of FRI with respiratory failure is important in order to implement early infection-control strategies to reduce transmission to health-care workers (HCWs) and other patients, as well as to provide detection of pathogens of public health importance. 1, 8 ICU patients with FRI and respiratory failure may be more infectious during the early phases of the disease, and these patients frequently require aerosol-generating procedures that can facilitate transmission in the ICU. 2,9 -11 Early recognition of FRI becomes important in reducing the likelihood of transmission within the ICU to HCWs, visitors, patients, and ultimately the community. Therefore, the approach to a patient with FRI and respiratory failure needs to evolve to include a public health perspective in addition to the focus on individual diagnosis and treatment. A standard approach of early recognition and isolation of FRI followed by early and aggressive diagnostic testing, treatment, and public health involvement is necessary to protect HCWs, patients, and the community from known and unknown emerging infectious diseases.\r\n Unfortunately, the exact etiology for FRI with respiratory failure leading to ARDS is unknown at the time of admission to the ICU. About half of FRIs with respiratory failure are one of the bacteria agents of community-acquired pneumonia, and these can largely be identified shortly after isolation and admission to the ICU with routine culture and testing. 3 Approximately 9% of FRIs in patients admitted to the ICU have a viral origin in prospective studies, and since only a few prospective cohort studies have been performed, a small number of viral etiologies have been documented in the literature. 3 Therefore, early in the course of FRI, care for the patient should focus on appropriate isolation followed by diagnostic testing. If one of the routine bacterial agents of FRI is not identified, diagnostic focus can shift to a possible viral cause. This shift should also involve the public health community, particularly if a known viral pathogen of public health concern is suspected or if viral testing is unsuccessful. Therefore, familiarity with the most common viral pathogens that cause FRIs and respiratory failure with ARDS in normal and mildly immunocompromised (not bone marrow transplant or HIV) hosts, along with their epidemiology, clinical features, treatment, and outcome, becomes important in order to facilitate rapid isolation, testing, diagnosis, and public health involvement.\r\n An acute respiratory illness can be caused by either influenza A or B, often during seasonal outbreaks. 12 With influenza A, three major hemagglutinin subtypes (H1, H2, and H3) with two neuroaminidase subtypes (N1 and N2) have been described in humans with frequent antigenic drift in these glycoprotiens. 12 Influenza B has less propensity for antigenic shift, and a few genetic drifts in the hemagglutinin have been described allowing for seasonal variability. 12 Both influenza A and B circu-late yearly, with influenza A beginning more abruptly and influenza B cases being more predominant in the later part of the season. However, regional differences exist, with more B strains found in Europe and Asia. Influenza B is more common in long-term care facilities, schools, or other institutions. Most cases of influenza are self-limiting infections with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, headache, myalgias, and malaise (an influenza-like illness [ILI]). 12, 13 Traditionally, influenza B has a more mild and self-limited course, but this difference cannot be determined on clinical grounds alone and requires laboratory confirmation. However, a smaller number of individuals with both influenza A or B, particularly higher-risk individuals (Table 1) , are likely to have a primary pneumonia. [13] [14] [15] [16] The respiratory symptoms will persist or progress, and in a minority of cases ARDS can develop. This occurs in individuals at higher risk and with chronic pulmonary disorders, but healthy individuals with this progression have been described as well. The majority of deaths during a seasonal outbreak occur from primary pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia. 12 During a seasonal outbreak, diagnosis can be made clinically with good reliability because a combination of fever and cough had a 79% positive predictive value. 12, 13 More definitive diagnosis can be made by viral detection in nasalpharyngeal aspirate, swab, or lower respiratory tract sample in a patient with appropriate clinical symptoms, with subtyping done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in public health laboratories (Table 1) . 12 Rapid influenza viral diagnostic tests using immunofluorescence or enzyme immunoassays provide rapid, reliable testing and can detect influenza A or B strains. However, viral shedding peaks at 48 h of illness and declines thereafter. Thus, PCR testing of a lower respiratory tract sample for FRI with ARDS may be more beneficial. Additionally, subtyping of a suspected case of influenza-related FRI with ARDS requires virus isolation that should be sent to a public health laboratory.\r\n Treatment of influenza can be undertaken with agents from two antiviral classes: the adamantanes and neuroaminidase inhibitors. 17 Due to widespread resistance to most adamantanes, use of these drugs should be reserved for cases or outbreaks with known susceptibility (Table 1) . Studies 17 with the neuraminidase inhibitors show a reduction in symptom time and viral shedding, with best effect seen when the drug is started within 48 h of symptom onset. Treatment with neuroaminidase inhibitors after 48 h may provide some additional benefit but have not been fully studied. Viral resistance to neuroaminidase inhibitors is low within the community. Influenza should be suspected during the winter epidemic season or if travel to an endemic area has occurred. 12 Transmission is primarily by droplets and contact with respiratory secretions, so patients suspected of influenza infection should be placed in droplet isolation, and HCWs should wear surgical masks, face shields, eye protection, gowns, and gloves as the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). 2, 18, 19 If a novel strain has been detected by laboratory testing, HCWs should wear an N-95 mask, and the patient should be placed in airborne isolation instead until mechanism of transmission is further understood. 20 Based on the SARS experience, higher-risk procedures generating aerosols ( Table 2 ) may require the use of an N-95 mask or a powered air-purified respirator. 2, 5, 7, 9 Avian Influenza Avian influenza A infections in humans have been increasing in incidence over the past decade. 17 These infections are caused by avian subtypes of influenza A, usually H5, H7, and H9. Most patients report contact with sick or dead poultry, although a few human-to-human cases of transmission have occurred. 17, 21, 22 Most subtypes present with conjunctivitis, but the highly pathogenic H5N1 subtypes present with severe primary pneumonia with respiratory failure and ARDS (Table 1) . 6, 17, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Respiratory failure with multiorgan damage is seen in \u03fe 60% cases, and the total mortality rate is \u03fe 60%. 29 Once admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, the mortality rate is \u03fe 90%. This observed mortality represents clinical patients who sought health care, and population-based questionnaire surveys suggest that milder and even subclinical infections may exist, thus likely significantly lowering the case fatality rate. 30 Diagnosis is by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR (viral isolation requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory) in a patient with appropriate clinical symptoms and epidemiologic risk factors and should always involve public health officials. 31 Treatment is supportive with addition of a neuroaminidase inhib-itor. The largest treatment experience has been with oseltamivir, and reduction of virus in nasal washings has been demonstrated. 17, 32, 33 Resistance has been demonstrated, largely due to a point mutation and change in a histidine to tyrosine within the neuraminidase receptor. 33 In vitro testing with a few strains has shown that this resistance can be overcome with higher doses of oseltamivir, but larger studies have not been performed. Additionally, resistance is not conferred to zanamivir.\r\n Most cases are initially detected by the epidemiologic link of contact with sick and dead birds. Transmission is likely droplet, but airborne transmission has been proposed by some officials, prompting higher levels of protection. 20 Ingestion of undercooked poultry and swimming with infected waterfowl have also been suspected as routes of human infection. Isolated cases of avian influenza in humans will be managed differently than pandemic influenza, with suspected patients being initially placed in airborne isolation and all HCWs wearing N-95 masks or other appropriate levels (powered air-purified respirator) of protection. 20 Isolated cases of humanto-human transmission have probably occurred among HCWs, but in all cases the appropriate PPE was not used. 17, 21, 22 Aerosol-generating procedures should be reduced if possible (Table 2) . Finally, any suspected case of avian influenza should prompt an urgent notification to local public health officials so that H5N1 infection can be verified and community measures to reduce spread can be instituted.\r\n SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in 2003. 5, 7, 34 Thousands of cases occurred worldwide in the initial epidemic in 2003, but the epidemic abated and new cases have not been reported since. 34 The clinical presentation is characterized by fever, chills, rigors, malaise, nausea, and shortness of breath (Table 1) . 5, 7, 35 The symptoms occurred on average 7 days after contact. Pneumonia appeared to develop approximately 8 days after onset of fever, with 45% of patients having hypoxemia. Approximately 20% of cases went on to severe lung injury and ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation 7, 11, 35 . Development of ARDS from onset of fever is bimodal, with peaks at 11 days and 20 days. The global fatality rate was 11%, with most deaths in patients \u03fe 65 years old. 7, 11 No deaths were reported in children. 7 Diagnosis includes an ILI with severe pneumonia in the presence of the epidemic or laboratory exposure with viral detection by RT-PCR in respiratory samples (Table 1) . 5, 7, 11, 36 A serum immunofluorescence assay may detect cases long after onset, and the only public health laboratory that performs these tests is at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Treatment is largely supportive, but steroids were used in some cases after the development of ARDS. Initial cases in 2003 were difficult to identify, which resulted in extensive spread to HCWs. Spread is by droplet transmission, although many cases suggest that airborne and contact routes also occur, and outbreak analysis has not ruled out oral-fecal spread as well. 2, 37 Spread to HCWs who wore appropriate PPE suggests airborne spread, and additional spread by aerosol-generating procedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), intubation, medication nebulization, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. 9, 10, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] The experience with SARS, particularly among HCWs, supports an approach to care requiring early isolation and enhanced PPE when engaging in certain higher-risk procedures (Table 2 ). 2, 20 The epidemic waned within a few months, so detection based on clinical grounds would require a high level of suspicion in either the context of a known laboratory exposure or a new confirmed SARS outbreak with epidemiologic risk. Therefore, any consideration of SARS or another potential virus should promptly be reported to hospital infection control and public health officials. 20\r\n Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes acute respiratory tract infections in all ages and is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children \u03fd 1 year of age. [42] [43] [44] In adults, RSV infections developed in 3 to 7% of elderly adults and were even higher in high-risk groups. 42, 43, 45 Infection follows a pattern similar to influenza, with epidemics occurring in the winter months. Adult infections are manifested predominately by upper respiratory tract symptoms, but some patients will have lower respiratory tract infections, including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, bronchospasm, and acute respiratory failure and ARDS (Table 1) . 43, 46, 47 Lower respiratory tract disease usually occurs with primary infection in children but can occur with recurrent infections into adulthood. The elderly and immunocompromised, particularly bone marrow transplant patients, are at highest risk of respiratory failure. Diagnosis is by clinical findings during an epidemic period with rapid antigen assays, viral isolation, or RT-PCR detection. 48 Treatment for bronchospasm includes bronchodilators and steroids, with ribavirin for severe and high-risk cases. 49 However, one recent randomized control trial 50 evaluated children \u03fd 12 months of age with moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis in which the majority of cases (\u03fe 60%) were caused by RSV; the results showed that a single dose of dexamethasone did not alter admission rates, length of stay, and respiratory status. Overall, 15% of patients with infections are admitted to the ICU, and the mortality rate can be surprisingly high, at 10% of all cases in the elderly. 42, 43, 45 Infection rarely occurs outside of the winter months unless travel to an epidemic area occurred. Spread is largely by contact and droplet transmission, with contact transmission playing a significant role when compared to other respiratory viruses. 43, 47 Therefore, hand washing greatly reduces the spread of RSV in addition to droplet isolation and the appropriate PPE. Viral shedding lasts 3 to 5 days on average, but higher-risk individuals in the ICU (immunocompromised, solid-organ transplant, and the elderly) may shed longer. Isolation should continue until 24 h after the cessation of fever.\r\n Adenovirus is one of the most common causes of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) in adults and children. 51, 52 However, severe lower respiratory tract disease has been described in healthy and at-risk individuals, particularly in military and other institutional settings. 53, 54 Pneumonia and ARDS develop in a minority of individuals and usually are associated with conjunctivitis and other extrapulmonary manifestations such as GI disease, hepatitis, meningitis, and hemmorhagic cystitis. [53] [54] [55] Extrapulmonary complications, along with ARDS, are more frequent in transplant recipients. 52 Pneumonia and ARDS appear to be more common with subtype E type 4 and subgroups B type 7. Serogroup 35 has been documented in long-term health facilities, such as mental health facilities. [52] [53] [54] Diagnosis is made by antigen assay or PCR, but viral culture is preferred for severe pneumonia and institutional outbreaks because serotyping is desired (Table 1) . 52 Treatment is largely supportive, although cidofovir and gancyclovir have some activity in vitro. 52 In the past, vaccination for military recruits was against serotype 4 and 7, which constituted \u03fe 60% of the cases of pneumonia 55 ; however, in 1999, the sole producer of this vaccine stopped production, and the military no longer routinely vaccinates recruits.\r\n Contact with infected fomites plays a large role in transmission because adenovirus remains viable on environmental surfaces for long periods of time. 51, [53] [54] [55] Some amount of droplet transmission also occurs, and the virus has a long period of shedding in transplant patients. 52 Therefore, aggressive decontamination of environmental surfaces along with contact and droplet precautions are indicated. 51 Public health officials should be contacted in any cases involving an institutional setting or if serotyping is desired.\r\n Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection causes acute and recurrent febrile illness, followed by malaise, pharyngitis, and a vesicular rash. 56, 57 Primary disease occurs throughout the year and is usually benign in immunocompetent individuals, with recurrent disease seen more in immuncompromised adults. Pneumonia develops with primary infection, occurs rarely in children, and progresses to respiratory failure and ARDS. [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] Pneumonia is the most frequent serious complication of VZV infection in adults, with an incidence of approximately 20% in primary VZV. Risk factors for pneumonia with respiratory failure and ARDS include pregnancy, smoking, and immunosuppression. 63, 64 Pneumonia and respiratory failure develop slowly, usually a few days after the onset of rash, and are signaled by tachypnea and hypoxia. 56, 58, 61, 62 Additional complications include encephalitis, hepatitis, and secondary skin and soft-tissue infections. [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] The overall mortality rate for VZV pneumonia remains high at 30%; in patients requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, the mortality rate approaches 50%. Clinical examination yields the diagnosis in many cases because vesicular rash accompanies any pulmonary disease. Confirmation of diagnosis is done by viral isolation and culture, immunosorbent assay, or pathologic findings on biopsy. Treatment including acyclovir and corticosteroids has been shown to lessen hospital and ICU stay but not alter the mortality rate. 59, 65 The routine use of the vaccine has altered typical presentation, with some children having breakthrough infections after only a single dose. 66 These infections usually are less severe, produce \u03fd 50 lesions on average, and rarely present with pneumonia, but immunity appears to wane after 5 years. Recent recommendations 66 call for a second booster dose of the vaccine within 5 years of the first.\r\n Spread is by direct contact with skin lesions, but in the case of primary infection and pneumonia, droplet transmission is also an important route. 57 The infective period can be long, from onset of fever prior to the rash until all lesions have crusted and the pneumonia has improved. 57,61,62 Therefore, HCWs and family members who do not have immunity from prior infection must avoid contact. If contact with infected patients must occur, protective equipment including gown, gloves, mask, and eye protection must be worn. 57 Vaccination of the nonimmune HCW should also be performed to reduce risk of transmission if they have no prior history of disease. 67 Pregnant HCWs are at risk due to the increased likelihood of primary varicella pneumonia, ARDS, and the effects of VZV on the fetus. 63, 64 Thus, pregnant staff cannot care for patients with active VZV. However, if contact occurs, the infection control specialist should be consulted.\r\n Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has worldwide distribution and is one cause of respiratory tract infections, although its incidence and epidemiologic features remain largely unknown. 68, 69 The virus was first detected in 2001 and has now been described in children and adults in a late winter-to-spring seasonal variability. One study 69 suggests that \u03fe 45% of cases of respiratory disease come from adults \u03fe 65 years old, causing approximately 5% of all respiratory infections. However, the extent of respiratory disease in adults is unknown and largely comes from population-based studies, not prospective cohort studies. Adult symptoms appear to include a self-limited cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea, but immunocompromised adults can have lower respiratory tract infection with respiratory failure. 68 -70 Progression, however, does appear rare, and no cases have been described in immunocompetent adults, and the only significant risk for progression to respiratory failure appears to be transplantation. Diagnosis is difficult because no reliable commercial assays are available, so detection is largely done by PCR on respiratory specimens. Viral culture can be easily obtained as well, but identification usually is done by public health laboratories. Treatment is supportive, especially since most cases are self limited. 68 -70 The mortality rate for infection with respiratory failure and ARDS is unknown, but deaths in bone marrow transplant patients have been reported. 70 Transmission is largely unknown because no formal studies exist, but contact and droplet transmission is suspected. 68 Although the extent and spectrum of hMPV disease is largely unknown, any suspected case in an adult with ARDS and respiratory failure should have respiratory samples sent to the public health laboratory for further investigation.\r\n Hantaviruses are part of a larger genus that contains \u03fe 20 viral species. This genus causes two severe acute febrile illness, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, found in the Old World, and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS), found in the New World. [71] [72] [73] In North America, the disease has been largely reported in the Southwest and California, with cases reported in Canada, Europe, China, Chile, Argentina, and other parts of South America. 74 Cyclical outbreaks tend to occur when the rodent population increases. 75 Symptoms initially begin with fever, chills, and myalgias in a prodromal phase. [71] [72] [73] 75 There is a lack of upper respiratory symptoms because the disease progresses rapidly to dry cough, respiratory failure, and ARDS, shock, coagulopathy, and arrhythmias. Resolution can also occur rapidly. Notably, thrombocytopenia with a immunoblast-predominant leukocytosis and an elevated hematocrit are characteristic of the early cardiopulmonary phase. 76 Diagnosis is by serologic testing of IgM in early disease and IgG in later disease through public health laboratories. Clinical contact with rodents in an endemic area with leukocytosis, elevated hematocrit, and thrombocytopenia should prompt consideration of the diagnosis. Treatment is mainly supportive, with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation being used in some patients 71, 73 ; ribaviron has been effective in hemmorhagic fever renal syndrome but not HPS. The mortality rate remains at approximately 20%.\r\n Transmission of hantavirus occurs through contact with rodent excrement (particularly urine) when the virus is aerosolized. [71] [72] [73] This mostly occurs in indoor settings where dead rodent and rodent urine are present. Direct live rodent contact has not been implicated in transmission, and no human-to-human transmission has been documented with HPS. Confirmed hantavirus infection should be reported to public health officials.\r\n In most cases, the etiology of a febrile respiratory illness is largely unknown on admission to the ICU. 34 Bacterial pathogens constitute most cases, and they often can be suspected early based on clinical findings and Gram stain of the sputum. Other cases may be more difficult, requiring further epidemiologic and diagnostic testing. Recent guidelines 4 have suggested that testing for viral pathogens be performed in patients with clinical and epidemiologic findings suggestive of viral illness, as well as placing them in droplet or airborne isolation depending on the suspected pathogen. However, many of these viral pathogens are highly contagious emerging infections or in fact may be novel strain. 7, 35 Often these patients will not be isolated and tested for these pathogens on hospital admission, and they will additionally undergo higher-risk aerosolizing procedures ( Table 2 ) that will increase the likelihood for disease transmission. This puts both HCWs and other patients at risk for acquiring disease, as experienced during the SARS epidemic. Therefore, a standardized approach, with early isolation and testing of these cases, can reduce the likelihood of disease transmission of an emerging pathogen within the ICU. Figure 1 outlines an approach to early isolation, testing, and involvement of institutional infection control, infectious diseases, and public health in patients with FRI and respiratory failure admitted to the ICU. All patients with FRI and respiratory failure should immediately be isolated on arrival to the health-care system, and subsequently undergo initial diagnostic testing, including pretreatment Gram stain, respiratory culture, and urine antigen testing for Legionella. If an etiologic agent is identified on initial screening and clinical findings (ie, Gram-positive diplococci with a lobar pneumonia on radiography), targeted treatment and ICU admission are performed. Further isolation of the patient can be discontinued at this point, depending on the identified organism. However, if an agent is not easily identified as often seen with viral causes of FRIs, the patients should remain in isolation and further diagnostic testing should be performed. Isolation should most likely be droplet, but based on specific epidemiologic clues airborne isolation may be instituted (Table 1) . 20 Many cases of viral pneumonia in the ICU are suspected based on certain at-risk groups, epidemiologic clues, and specific clinical findings. If these are present, testing should target these pathogens, but viral culture and isolation should be performed to rule out other agents as well. If a certain viral pathogen, such as avian influenza or SARS, is suspected based on these clues, hospital infection control, infectious diseases, microbiology, and the public health officials should be notified immediately. Although bronchoscopy generates aerosols and can increase transmission risk, it should not be avoided in these cases because viral isolation and etiology becomes important from a public health perspective and transmission risk is low when the appropriate PPE is used. Isolation of the virus from a nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate is highest early in disease course, but by the time the patient has disease developed in the lower respiratory tract with respiratory failure, a lower respiratory sample by bronchoscopy may provide the highest yield. In addition to more specific testing, a sample should be sent for viral culture, which provides a viral isolate for further testing, subtyping, and resistance analysis if ever indicated (unless avian influenza is suspected, since this requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory Involvement of institutional infection control, infectious disease specialist, microbiology, and public health is paramount for successful containment of disease and thus should be started as early as possible, as outlined in Figure 1 . Hospital-based infection control will assist in isolation and HCW protection, and the hospital-based microbiology laboratory should be notified of suspected pathogens, allowing for worker protection and targeted testing of samples. Public health involvement will allow a broader viral testing, including additional agents, subtyping, and resistance testing. If the agent is a novel or emerging pathogen, as seen with SARS or avian influenza, early public health involvement will allow for rapid laboratory testing, epidemiologic investigation, case definition, and community prevention. Finally, public health also has a broader view of the disease burden within the region. A single physician seeing a patients with FRI and ARDS may not be aware of multiple other cases within the region, and thus involvement of public health allows this broader perspective.\r\n Finally, aerosol-generating procedures are most common in ICU patients with FRI and respiratory failure, and HCWs are thus at high risk for exposure to these pathogens. However, most cases of transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, such as CPR and bag-valve mask ventilation, are based largely on epidemiologic and case studies, and direct studies are lacking. Yet, appropriate PPE should be worn by HCWs at all times; if worn properly, disease transmission is lower risk and thus these procedures can be performed. In fact, they are crucial to the diagnosis in many cases of FRI with respiratory failure. Most cases during the SARS and avian influenza epidemic appeared to have occurred when HCWs did not wear the appropriate PPE, which appears to be the largest risk factor for transmission to the HCW. 2, 25 Conclusion\r\n The approach to patients with an acute FRI and respiratory failure can be challenging. In addition to the management of each individual patient's critical illness, management needs to include an institutional and public health perspective. Early testing and isolation for potentially contagious patients can reduce transmission to HCWs, patients, and the community. Only a small number of viral pathogens are likely to produce respiratory failure and ARDS, so targeted testing can often achieve diagnosis. Early communication with public health officials is very important because they can assist with more complex diagnosis and disease investigation, enhancing the diagnosis and reducing the risk of transmission. Finally, all HCWs should wear appropriate PPE at all times, reducing the risk of disease transmission in these high-risk patients.","sha":"a79eda4de7857a7fe88b83a1cc494013c23fc048","publish_time":"2008-05-31","authors":"Sandrock, Christian; Stollenwerk, Nicholas","journal":"Chest","doi":"10.1378\/chest.07-0778","Title":"Chest","H index":267.0,"transmission_indicator":true,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"F ebrile respiratory illnesses (FRIs) leading to respiratory failure are common reasons for admission from the community to the ICU. 1, 8 ICU patients with FRI and respiratory failure may be more infectious during the early phases of the disease, and these patients frequently require aerosol-generating procedures that can facilitate transmission in the ICU.

Viral resistance to neuroaminidase inhibitors is low within the community. Influenza should be suspected during the winter epidemic season or if travel to an endemic area has occurred. 2, 18, 19 If a novel strain has been detected by laboratory testing, HCWs should wear an N-95 mask, and the patient should be placed in airborne isolation instead until mechanism of transmission is further understood. Most patients report contact with sick or dead poultry, although a few human-to-human cases of transmission have occurred. Additionally, resistance is not conferred to zanamivir. Most cases are initially detected by the epidemiologic link of contact with sick and dead birds. Development of ARDS from onset of fever is bimodal, with peaks at 11 days and 20 days. 7, 11 No deaths were reported in children. Spread is by droplet transmission, although many cases suggest that airborne and contact routes also occur, and outbreak analysis has not ruled out oral-fecal spread as well. The elderly and immunocompromised, particularly bone marrow transplant patients, are at highest risk of respiratory failure. 49 However, one recent randomized control trial 50 evaluated children \u03fd 12 months of age with moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis in which the majority of cases (\u03fe 60%) were caused by RSV; the results showed that a single dose of dexamethasone did not alter admission rates, length of stay, and respiratory status. Overall, 15% of patients with infections are admitted to the ICU, and the mortality rate can be surprisingly high, at 10% of all cases in the elderly. Isolation should continue until 24 h after the cessation of fever. Adenovirus is one of the most common causes of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) in adults and children. 53, 54 Pneumonia and ARDS develop in a minority of individuals and usually are associated with conjunctivitis and other extrapulmonary manifestations such as GI disease, hepatitis, meningitis, and hemmorhagic cystitis. [ 51 Public health officials should be contacted in any cases involving an institutional setting or if serotyping is desired. 58] [59] [60] [61] [62] The overall mortality rate for VZV pneumonia remains high at 30%; in patients requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, the mortality rate approaches 50%. Clinical examination yields the diagnosis in many cases because vesicular rash accompanies any pulmonary disease. Confirmation of diagnosis is done by viral isolation and culture, immunosorbent assay, or pathologic findings on biopsy. Recent recommendations 66 call for a second booster dose of the vaccine within 5 years of the first. 63, 64 Thus, pregnant staff cannot care for patients with active VZV. 68, 69 The virus was first detected in 2001 and has now been described in children and adults in a late winter-to-spring seasonal variability. Treatment is supportive, especially since most cases are self limited. 68 Although the extent and spectrum of hMPV disease is largely unknown, any suspected case in an adult with ARDS and respiratory failure should have respiratory samples sent to the public health laboratory for further investigation. Hantaviruses are part of a larger genus that contains \u03fe 20 viral species. This genus causes two severe acute febrile illness, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, found in the Old World, and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS), found in the New World. [ 71] [72] [73] In North America, the disease has been largely reported in the Southwest and California, with cases reported in Canada, Europe, China, Chile, Argentina, and other parts of South America. 75 Symptoms initially begin with fever, chills, and myalgias in a prodromal phase. [ Clinical contact with rodents in an endemic area with leukocytosis, elevated hematocrit, and thrombocytopenia should prompt consideration of the diagnosis. Treatment is mainly supportive, with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation being used in some patients 71, 73 ; ribaviron has been effective in hemmorhagic fever renal syndrome but not HPS. The mortality rate remains at approximately 20%. 71] [72] [73] This mostly occurs in indoor settings where dead rodent and rodent urine are present. 34 Bacterial pathogens constitute most cases, and they often can be suspected early based on clinical findings and Gram stain of the sputum. However, many of these viral pathogens are highly contagious emerging infections or in fact may be novel strain. However, if an agent is not easily identified as often seen with viral causes of FRIs, the patients should remain in isolation and further diagnostic testing should be performed. If these are present, testing should target these pathogens, but viral culture and isolation should be performed to rule out other agents as well. In fact, they are crucial to the diagnosis in many cases of FRI with respiratory failure. Early testing and isolation for potentially contagious patients can reduce transmission to HCWs, patients, and the community."},{"Unnamed: 0":30,"Unnamed: 0.1":30,"doc_id":"d527a648fba2f8a8cc2207735a35cc5649b44fa9","title":"Airflows Around Oxygen Masks* A Potential Source of Infection? Original Research RESPIRATORY CARE 822 Original Research","abstract":"Patients with respiratory infections often require the use of supplemental oxygen via oxygen masks, which, in the hospital, may become sources of aerosolized infectious pathogens. To assess this risk, a human lung model (respiration rate, 12 breaths\/min) was designed to test the potential for a simple oxygen mask at a common setting (4 L\/min) to disperse potentially infectious exhaled air into the surrounding area. A laser sheet was used to illuminate the exhaled air from the mask, which contained fine tracer smoke particles. An analysis of captured digital images showed that the exhaled air at the peak of simulated exhalation reached a distance of approximately 0.40 m. (CHEST 2006; 130:822-826) ","text_body":"P atients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia often require supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula or oronasal masks. Usually, there are no additional isolation precautions taken for such patients, and they may be on an open ward with a respiratory infection, breathing with the aid of an oxygen mask that is supplying oxygen at a flow rate of up to 10 L\/min. However, little is known about the airflow characteristics of such oxygen delivery devices and their ability to transmit infection by aerosol. This problem of hospital-acquired infection via infectious aerosol was highlighted in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics of 2003. 1 Many cases of SARS occurred within hospitals with infections taking place between patients and health-care workers, in some cases apparently assisted by oxygen delivery and other respiratory support devices. 1 Since then, it has been reported that SARS-coronavirus (CoV) RNA can be detected in air, 2 and in some cases airborne SARS CoV can also be grown in culture, demonstrating viability. 3 More recently, avian influenza (influenza H5N1) has led to a high mortality rate in human cases in Thailand and Vietnam. 4, 5 The strongest case implicating person-toperson transmission of influenza H5N1 also occurred in a hospital setting. 6 The potential for long-range, airborne transmission for both influenza 6, 7 and SARS CoV 8 has been reported. Yet, it has been difficult to demonstrate the risk of aerosol transmission of such respiratory infections in the health-care environment, and there are still many serious gaps in our knowledge. 7 In one study, using aerosolized 3% hypertonic saline solution and photographic techniques, Somogyi et al 9 demonstrated that throughout exhalation, both the nonrebreathing and Venturi-type oxygen masks channeled the exhaled gas through side vents, forming a leakage plume of exhaled gas that was directed to either side of the patient. The authors asked the volunteer to hold his breath for approximately 2 s, while the masks were fitted to his face. The volunteer then exhaled smoothly for at least 2 s, during which a series of still photographs were taken. Although the volunteer's breathing action was not physiologic in this study, the authors demonstrated that such oxygen masks could produce potentially infectious plumes from exhaled air that could be inhaled by health-care workers, visitors, and other patients.\r\n In order to further assess the potential for oxygen masks to spread infection, we designed a human lung model with a more realistic breathing cycle. In addition, we applied an engineering-based approach to visualize and analyze the airflow images recorded on digital video during simulated respiration with a simple oxygen mask.\r\n A high-fidelity human patient simulator (HPS) [model 6.1; Medical Education Technologies Inc; Sarasota, FL], representing a medium-sized adult man sitting on a 45 o -inclined hospital bed, was fitted with a simple oxygen mask (HS-3031; Hsiner; Taichung Hsien, Taiwan). The head, neck, and internal airways of the HPS were configured to allow realistic airflow modeling in the airways and around the face. Oxygen flow was set as 4 L\/min, and the simulator was programmed for a respiratory rate of 12 breaths\/min and a tidal volume of 0.5 L.\r\n The mask airflow was visualized by smoke using an M-6000 smoke generator (model N19; DS Electronics; Tempe, AZ). The generated smoke was continuously introduced to the right main bronchus of the HPS as part of the inhaled air. This design allowed the smoke to continuously mix with the alveolar gas and then to be part of the exhaled air, to allow visualization.\r\n Initially, the smoke airflow was illuminated with a strong halogen light to reveal the full three-dimensional extent of the mask airflow and the leakage plume. Sections through the plume were then revealed by an intense laser light-sheet created by an Nd:YVO 4 Q-switched, frequency-doubled laser (OEM T20-BL 10 -106Q; Spectra-Physics Lasers; Mountain View, CA), with custom cylindrical optics for two-dimensional laser light-sheet generation (Fig 1) . This was recorded with a three charge-couple device, \u03eb48 zoom digital video system (Sony; Tokyo, Japan) at an image rate of 30 Hz.\r\n The laser light-sheet was adjusted to encompass the full leakage plume, which was previously identified from the halogen light observations and set at a thickness of approximately 1 to 2 mm. The light-sheet (green, 527-nm wavelength, transverse electromagnetic mode 00 , and 2-W average power) was positioned on one side of the manikin, with the plane of the light-sheet adjusted for the mask to illuminate as much of the smoke cloud as possible. The cross-sectional plane of the leakage plume and sections through it were of interest. The laser could be run in continuous wave mode (100 mW average power), or high-frequency (350 kHz) pulsed mode for pulse intensities up to an average of 2 W. Pulse frequencies of \u03fe 1 kHz were found to be effectively continuous wave for both video and observation by eye.\r\n Following the positioning of the laser light-sheet, the video images captured were synchronized with the respiratory cycle by starting the video capture at the exact beginning of breath exhalation. The video recording captured many simulated breath cycles, and the images corresponding to the maximum expired volume during each respiratory cycle were analyzed. Both realtime full-motion video (30 images per second) and snapshot images of the video images were analyzed.\r\n Full-motion video was reviewed in real-time using a movie editor (Windows Movie Maker; Microsoft; Richmond, WA), and the best images of respiration showing airflow behavior were analyzed using software that was developed for this study (Matlab 6.5). In order to obtain the clearest boundary of dissemination, image-processing techniques were applied to these images to define the edge of the visible smoke boundary from the captured digital video images (see supplementary material at www.chestnet. org). These techniques were applied to a selected video image that represented the peak of simulated exhalation during one breath cycle by the human simulator. Finally, we assumed that the smoke propagations were symmetric under the symmetric mask structure. This was observed and confirmed during the initial three-dimensional flow visualization using the halogen light. Hence, a symmetric image was constructed (Fig 2) .\r\n The final maximum distance traveled by the exhaled smoke plume, using this simple oxygen mask (HS-3031; Hsiner) with an oxygen flow of 4 L\/min, a respiratory rate of 12 breaths\/min, and a tidal volume of 0.5 L, was approximately 0.40 m (Fig 2) . It was finally decided to choose the video image\/footage of the most clearly illuminated smoke plume, demonstrating the maximum distance traveled at the peak of exhalation for image analysis. The reason for this was one of safety. Such a maximum distance will give added safety if it is used as a guide to the safe distance required for the prevention of hospitalacquired aerosol transmission infections. This distance was defined on the basis of the image analysis technique that was used to smooth and approximate the boundary of the visible smoke on video that had been recorded by the digital camera. The defined boundary of the smoke was based on the reflected light intensity of the smoke particles when illuminated by the laser sheet (see supplementary material for further details).\r\n The HPS has been used in medical training, especially in anesthesia, emergency, and critical care medicine. It is also a realistic representation of human respiratory physiology. The HPS contains a realistic airway and a lung model that undergoes gas exchange (ie, it consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide). The lung compliance and airway resistance respond in a realistic manner to relevant challenges. It also produces an airflow pattern that is close to the in vivo human situation. A report on the use of an HPS to study complex respiratory physiology has been published previously. 10 -14 There have been a few studies about the production of aerosols from the use of oxygen masks. However, although their methodology was quite different, a useful comparison can still be made with the study by Somogyi et al, 9 who produced images of exhaled airflows using three different oxygen masks on a human volunteer. Their study is not directly comparable to this one mainly because the oxygen masks they used had no oxygen flow supplied. Only the volunteer's natural exhalation after brief breath holding produced the air movement. This is not a natural breathing cycle, and, in this respect, the cyclical respiration pattern in the human lung model presented here may be more realistic. Although Somogyi et al 9 showed images of the behavior of the exhaled air plume, they did not report quantitative data, such as the distance traveled by the visible air plumes shown in their images. However, a closer inspection of their Figure 1A , which illustrates a side plume of exhaled air emitted from a simple nonrebreathing oxygen mask, appears to show that it extends approximately two head diameters away from the mask. The head diameter of an adult has been reported to be approximately 13 to 16 cm. 15 Thus, the extent of the visible plume shown in their Figure 1A can be estimated to be approximately 0.30 m. Furthermore, these authors stated the following: \"The spread of the exhaled gas may be greater than shown, as evaporation and reduction in density of the droplets at the margin of the plume may limit their effectiveness as markers.\" Although the methodology and human lung model parameters used in this study may have been somewhat different (oxygen flow, 4 L\/min; respiratory rate, 12 breaths\/ min; tidal volume, 0.5 L), the distance traveled (0.40 m) by the exhaled smoke plume in this study seems remarkably similar.\r\n There are some limitations that are specific to this study. Most significantly, fine smoke particles rather than droplets were used in this study. This smoke consists of submicrometer m particles that will follow the path of the air flow precisely. 16, 17 Thus, the extent of spread of the smoke is representative of the airflow around the mask. This distance is derived from smoke particles that are visible enough to be analyzed from the digitally captured video images. This will almost certainly be a lower limit approximation as there will be smoke particles traveling beyond the visible boundaries seen in these images. These particles cannot be visualized effectively because there are too few at these distances to scatter sufficient light to be easily detected on the video images.\r\n Second, it has been estimated that droplets generated from the upper respiratory tract by, for instance, coughing, sneezing, talking, singing, and breathing, range from 0.5 to 12 m in diameter. 18 As viral and bacterial agents range from approximately 0.020 to 100 m in size, the size of the exhaled droplet will obviously limit the number of such infectious agents that can be carried in each droplet. The majority of naturally produced aerosol droplets are much larger than the smoke particles used in this study. Therefore, most of them will not follow the exhaled airflow perfectly, but will move relatively more slowly horizontally due to their larger size and will fall more quickly under the effects of gravity 19 and thus not travel as far as the smoke particles used in this study. However, some of the smaller droplets exhaled by a human patient may be reduced in size sufficiently by evaporation within the exhaled, oxygen-assisted airflow and remain suspended in air for considerable periods of time. These smaller particles may then more closely be represented by the smoke particles used in this study. Therefore, the boundaries of the smoke cloud indicated in Figure 2 are likely to represent an upper boundary of the distance traveled by real infectious droplets and may therefore be taken as defining a zone of potential aerosol infection with an extra margin of safety.\r\n There is no reliable and safe marker that can be introduced into human lungs for study. The use of the human lung model here allows for only one set of parameters to be tested at one time. So, while a healthy human patient would sometimes be breathing quietly, then sometimes talking, coughing, or sneezing (when the mask may be removed), the behavior of this human lung model is unchanging. However, this study allows a baseline estimate of the distance traveled by any potentially infectious aerosols, while the patient is at rest.\r\n This study effectively complements that of Somogyi et al 9 and demonstrates that patients with transmissible respiratory infections such as influenza H5N1 and SARS, who are breathing with the aid of oxygen masks, may be a potential source of aerosoltransmitted infection. These patients should, ideally, be managed in a single, isolation room, under nega-tive pressure, though with their relatively high cost, not all health-care institutions may possess such facilities. During the SARS epidemics of 2003, health-care workers managing SARS patients found that they could protect themselves by the effective and consistent use of personal protective equipment, 20 and that the converse was also true. 21 Influenza H5N1 is likely to be a more infectious, transmissible pathogen, 22 so effective, well-informed infection control precautions will be even more important to prevent hospital-acquired infections in both health-care workers and patients.","sha":"d527a648fba2f8a8cc2207735a35cc5649b44fa9","publish_time":"2006-09-30","authors":"Hui, David S.; Ip, Margaret; Tang, Julian W.; Wong, Alexandra L.N.; Chan, Matthew T.V.; Hall, Stephen D.; Chan, Paul K.S.; Sung, Joseph J.Y.","journal":"Chest","doi":"10.1378\/chest.130.3.822","Title":"Chest","H index":267.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"P atients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia often require supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula or oronasal masks. 7 In one study, using aerosolized 3% hypertonic saline solution and photographic techniques, Somogyi et al 9 demonstrated that throughout exhalation, both the nonrebreathing and Venturi-type oxygen masks channeled the exhaled gas through side vents, forming a leakage plume of exhaled gas that was directed to either side of the patient.

The development of modern respiratory medicine in China has undergone three phases, primarily driven by the disease burdens and the corresponding regulation priorities.\r\n The fi rst phase (1920s to 1960s) was a phase of prevention and management of TB. During this period, pulmonary TB was the most common respiratory disease in China. TB was extensively studied, and TB control was one of the top priorities in national public health programs in the 1950s. 1 When effective prevention and treatment became available and TB was brought under control, the focus gradually shifted to other respiratory diseases.\r\n The second phase (1970s to mid-1990s) was that of prevention and management of cor pulmonale. The prevention and treatment of the four respiratory diseases of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, cor pulmonale, and infl uenza dominated the fi eld. As a result, a specialized department focusing on respiratory medicine was established in most general hospitals, and many participating physicians became respiratory specialists. This period laid a solid foundation for the development of respiratory medicine in China.\r\n The third phase (mid-1990s to present) is that of modern respiratory medicine. Respiratory medicine has developed rapidly in China. Respiratory medicine and critical care medicine have been merged as one department of respiratory and critical care medicine in many leading hospitals, and respiratory\/medical ICUs The past century witnessed a rapid development of respiratory medicine in China. The major burden of respiratory disease has shifted from infectious diseases to chronic noninfectious diseases. Great achievements have been made in improving the national standard of clinical management of various respiratory diseases and in smoking control. The specialty of respiratory medicine is expanding into pulmonary and critical care medicine. Nevertheless, respiratory diseases remain a major public health problem, with new challenges such as air pollution and nosocomial infections. This review describes the history, accomplishments, new challenges, and opportunities in respiratory medicine in China.\r\n Abbreviations: CAP 5 community-acquired pneumonia; HAP 5 hospital-acquired pneumonia; NIPPV 5 noninvasive positive pressure ventilation; PAH 5 pulmonary arterial hypertension; PIC 5 pulmonary infection control; PTE 5 pulmonary thromboembolism; SARS 5 severe acute respiratory syndrome","text_body":"and medical communities. In 1997, the fi rst Chinese guideline on COPD management was published by the Chinese Thoracic Society. 19 The Chinese guidelines are generally in line with international guidelines but also accommodate practical issues, such as cost and availability of specifi c interventions. COPD is now listed as one of the major diseases in a governmentinitiated national project for prevention and control of noncommunicable chronic diseases. The specifi c goals of this project include early diagnosis and intervention of COPD, smoking control, improvement of patients' self-management, and physicians' compliance with guidelines.\r\n Asthma is a major clinical problem and one of the most common causes of hospitalization for children in China. The prevalence of asthma has increased from 0.91% in 1990 to 1.50% in 2000. 20 The prevalence in adults ranges from 0.94% in southern China to 1.25% in northern China. [21] [22] [23] The prevalence of asthma was found to be higher among workers in chemical factories (1.06%) and large petrochemical factories (2.81%) than in farmers living in rural areas (0.43%), prompting an association of asthma with environment pollution. 24 The pathogenesis of asthma may also be associated with the dysregulation of infl ammatory reaction in asthma. [25] [26] [27] Hospital-based asthma education and management programs are effective in improving asthma control and quality of life. 28 The Chinese Thoracic Society updates its asthma guidelines every 5 years to keep up with the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and to incorporate new data from Chinese studies.\r\n Respiratory infections have long posed a major health threat to Chinese people. From the 1950s to 1960s, TB, bacterial pneumonia, and lung abscess were the most prevalent lung infections, which shifted to hospitalacquired pneumonia (HAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the 1980s. The isolation of antimicrobial resistant strains in CAP [29] [30] [31] and HAP 32 has raised concerns for the misuse of antibiotics. Chinese guidelines on HAP and CAP have been developed. 33, 34 The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 triggered extensive research 35 and led to the establishment of an effective system in controlling the emerging respiratory viral diseases. [36] [37] [38] [39] Corticosteroids were effective to reduce fatality and hospital stay in critically ill patients with SARS, 40 and a vaccine has been developed for its prevention. 41 With the experience of dealing with SARS, the Chinese medical community and public health system responded quickly to the later epidemic of avian have been established. This review focuses on the recent achievements, present challenges, and future directions of respiratory medicine in China.\r\n Along with the rapid development of science and technology and the enhanced international collaborations, respiratory medicine in China has achieved great progress in various disciplines in recent years. Many guidelines on the management of respiratory diseases have been developed or updated based on both the international guidelines\/consensuses and local conditions (eg, the specifi c physiologic conditions or regional economic situations).\r\n It is estimated that 8.2% of people older than 40 years, or 43 million people, suffer from COPD in China. 2 COPD imposes a huge economic burden in China. 3 The costs of caring for patients with COPD were equivalent to 110% of the annual income of rural residents and 34% of that of urban residents. 4 Efforts have been made to identify risk factors and mechanisms of COPD development in China. Smoking, air pollution, biomass fuel use, and occupational dust exposure seem to account for the high COPD prevalence. The male sex and low socioeconomic status are also associated with COPD. 5, 6 Several genetic factors, such as polymorphisms in IL-27, 7 tumor necrosis factor-a , 8,9 aquaporin 5, 10 heme oxygenase-1, 11,12 and epoxide hydrolase1 13 have been shown to increase susceptibility to COPD in the Chinese population. A causal relationship between depression and COPD exacerbation has also been proposed. 14 The ongoing hot research topics also include the role of infl ammation in COPD and the therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing the destruction of lung tissues.\r\n In clinical management, COPD exacerbations can be reduced by carbocisteine, 15 theophylline, 16 and salmeterol\/fl uticasone propionate. 17 Community-based interventions, including health education, individualized treatment, and pulmonary rehabilitation, may be effective in the prevention and management of COPD. 18 Although data in older people are abundant, the prevalence of COPD in younger populations is not known. Younger patients should be particularly targeted, since COPD may start early in life, and early diagnosis and intervention may reduce its progression. To achieve this goal, a nationwide survey of lung function has recently been initiated in China, beginning with people \u0546 18 years of age.\r\n The battle against COPD in China is an arduous task and requires joint efforts from the government and . 250,000 deaths from the disease are predicted each year. 56 Similar to the developed countries, most lung cancer cases are inoperable at diagnosis. Although high-quality care has become available for residents in socioeconomically developed areas, treatment of lung cancer remains primitive in many rural areas.\r\n Probably unique in China, respiratory physicians are involved in diagnosis as well as management of lung cancer, including administration of chemotherapy. Although the Chinese guideline is widely available, 57 heterogeneity in the quality of care among centers, especially the disparity between urban and rural areas, has restricted the management of lung cancer in a more consistent way. As elsewhere around the globe, platinum-based doublet chemotherapy remains the most commonly used regimen, and some new epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapies have also been investigated in many medical centers. 58 In recent years, increasingly more regional hospitals are equipped with CT scanners and even PET-CT scanners, facilitating early diagnosis of lung cancer. The multidisciplinary treatment, especially the molecular targeted therapy, will further improve the survival of patients with lung cancer.\r\n Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) was significantly underdiagnosed in China for a long time, until the late 1990s, when several clinical studies demonstrated that it was in fact a common disease in the Chinese population. 59, 60 In 2001, the fi rst guideline for PTE was published, 61 the fi rst national conference on PTE was held, and a nationwide collaborative group was organized in China. The group conducted a series of multicenter studies on PTE, 62-64 which effectively increased awareness and improved diagnosis and management of PTE, leading to a decrease in PTE fatalities in China. 65 Genetic polymorphisms associated with PTE among the Chinese were characterized, and several genetic traits in fibrinogen b 66 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 67 were linked to an increased risk of PTE in the Chinese population. However, the low incidences of factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene G20210A, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene C677T muta tion suggest that they are not the major genetic risk factors for PTE in the Chinese population. [68] [69] [70] Great efforts have been made to fi nd the optimal regimens for treating PTE. Wang et al 71 demonstrated that a short regimen of 2-h urokinase IV showed similar effi cacy and safety as standard 12-h urokinase IV in treating acute pulmonary embolism. The new regimen signifi cantly reduces the cost of the treatment. In another multicenter trial, the same group reported a similar effi cacy, but better safety, when the dosing infl uenza in 2009. 42, 43 The clinical features, such as incu bation period and common symptoms, were reported. 44 The effi cacy and safety of oseltamivir and maxingshigan-yinqiaosan, a formula of traditional Chinese medicine, in treating 2009 infl uenza A(H1N1 ) were tested. 45 Studies on the effectiveness of traditional Chinese drugs are especially important, because these drugs are widely accepted by Chinese people, and some of them have been applied for thousands of years. The rapid and successful control of the A(H1N1) pandemic in China was highly praised. 46 After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the Chinese government implemented a series of measures to strengthen its public health system. This was reinforced by the efforts in TB control. 47 With increased inputs on TB control, China achieved its major goals in the fi ght against TB from 2001 to 2010. 48 However, TB control in China will remain a long-term public health challenge because of the high rates of multidrug resistance and the emerging TB and HIV coinfection. In the foreseeable future, advances in DNA sequencing and genomic technology will allow the rapid identifi cation of new pathogens and facilitate studies on the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions under specifi c disease conditions and studies on the interactions of the lung microbiome with microbial populations located in other organs\/systems.\r\n Interstitial lung diseases have been increasingly recognized in China. Sarcoidosis is the most studied interstitial lung disease. The HLA-DR gene may be associated with the susceptibility to sarcoidosis in the Chinese population, 49 and glucocorticoid therapy may improve outcome. 50 Idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis is also a common condition in China, and lung transplantation may be feasible for patients with end-stage idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis. 51 Occupational lung diseases are characterized by their high morbidity and mortality. A large proportion of Chinese people are at high risk for these diseases. Pneumoconioses are the major occupational lung diseases, accounting for 70% to 80% of the total occupational diseases, and 12,000 to 15,000 new cases were reported annually. 52 Exposure to chrysotile asbestos, arsenic, radon, and cadmium can induce pneumoconiosis. 53 Furthermore, a higher incidence of lung cancer was observed in patients with silicosis, 54, 55 and its underlying pathogenesis is under investigation.\r\n A substantial proportion of cancer-related deaths in China are attributed to lung cancer. In China, about 300,000 new lung cancer cases (23 out of 100,000) estimated in the range of 3.5% to 4.8% in the Chinese population . 30 years old. 82 A close association between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and cardiovascular diseases 83, 84 has been described. The Sleep Breathing Disorder Assembly of the Chinese Thoracic Society was organized in 2000, and the fi rst guideline for sleep breathing disorders was issued in 2002 85 and updated in 2011. 86 More than 600 sleep laboratories have been established throughout China. 82 Almost all university hospitals and hospitals at the province level have established their sleep laboratories, and some laboratories are operated by other departments (eg, ear, nose, and throat department). Sleep medicine in China is still in its infancy. The awareness of sleep breathing disorders remains to be promoted among primary healthcare providers. Insurance coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders will be the key for a wide public benefi t.\r\n As the world's largest cigarette consumer and manufacturer, China has . 300 million smokers, and . 740 million nonsmokers are exposed to second-hand smoking. 87 It is estimated that . 1 million Chinese people die because of smoking-related diseases each year. The direct economic burden of tobacco use reaches 42.31 billion yuan (equivalent to 6.09 billion US dollars) in China. 88 With such a huge impact of tobacco use, smoking control becomes a top priority of the Chinese health authorities. Since the ratifi cation of Framework Convention of Tobacco Control in 2005, 89 87 This event has been considered by the World Health Organization as a milestone for disease prevention and control in China. 91 Despite the progress, enforcement of smokingrelated laws and regulations remains a challenging task. The existing public health policies should be strengthened, and new strategies, including raising taxes on tobacco products, will be explored. Physicians play a leading role in smoking control. Smoking cessation training programs for physicians, especially for male physicians, who are less likely to provide smoking cessation counseling for patients, should be enforced. 92 The research on smoking hazards and smoking control has gradually become a highly specialized area in medicine, which includes the further elucidation of smoking prevalence and social behavior, harmful ingredients in tobacco, smoking-related diseases and their of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator was decreased from 100 mg to 50 mg in treating acute massive PTE. 72 Currently, clinical trials on new anticoagulants for PTE and thrombolytic therapy for submassive pulmonary embolism have been initiated.\r\n With improved diagnosis of PTE, more patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been identifi ed. 73 More than fi ve medical centers in China can provide pulmonary endarterectomy and lung\/heart transplantation. Currently, a registry of PAH and multicenter trials for the evaluation of targeted therapy for PAH in the Chinese population are in progress. Laboratory research in pulmonary hypertension, focusing on the effects of the vanilloid-related ion channel 74 and Ca 2 1 ions 75 on proliferation of human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell, is being conducted by Chinese investigators.\r\n In China, clinical application of positive pressure ventilation dates back to the 1970s, and the use of noninvasive positive ventilation started in the 1990s. The Chinese Thoracic Society developed guidelines with recommendations for mechanical ventilation in 2007 76 and for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in 2009. 77 In 2005, the concept of a pulmonary infection control (PIC) window was proposed to facilitate transition from invasive to noninvasive ventilation during COPD exacerbation. 78 The PIC window denotes that, in the management of ventilator support in patients with COPD with acute respiratory failure triggered by pulmonary infection, early extubation followed by noninvasive mechanical ventilation during the time of the PIC window will signifi cantly reduce the risk of ventilatoracquired pneumonia and improve the prognosis. The PIC window was subsequently proven useful in replacing intubation with sequential noninvasive ventilation in a nationwide multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial. 78 Another multicenter randomized controlled trial showed that early use of NIPPV in acute exacerbation of COPD could alleviate respiratory muscle fatigue and prevent worsening of respiratory failure. 79 Application of NIPPV was also shown to be benefi cial in severe hypercapnic encephalopathy 80 and for acute lung injury. 81 A multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial with a larger sample size is being conducted in China to assess the benefi t of NIPPV use in patients with acute lung injury.\r\n The link between sleep apnea and respiratory diseases has been increasingly recognized in China. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is medicine and critical care medicine, and currently no national standard curricula and certifi cation examinations are available in this fi eld. Reform on medical education and training is urgently needed, and continuous medical educational programs should be carefully designed and provided to meet the rapidly increasing demands.\r\n Respiratory diseases are the leading causes of death and socioeconomic burdens in China. Signifi cant progress has been made in improving the management of various respiratory diseases and in tobacco control. Respiratory diseases remain a major public health problem, whereas respiratory medicine is facing more new challenges. In the battle against respiratory diseases, the Chinese Thoracic Society is taking a leading role in promoting the collaborative efforts to improve the standards of medical practice and patient care, to support research, to train young respiratory physicians, and ultimately to fulfi ll our mission in saving lives and alleviating suffering for patients with respiratory diseases. mechanisms, tobacco cessation and the management of tobacco dependence, and smoking prevention and control . Just like the emergence and development of occupational medicine in the practice of prevention and management of occupational diseases, a specialized medical discipline, tobacco medicine, is growing in popularity.\r\n Respiratory medicine is facing signifi cant challenges. To overcome this obstacle, we need to continue to improve our understanding of the complex respiratory diseases and to develop more effective therapies to prevent and treat these conditions. Rapid development in science and technology offers new approaches to achieve this goal. Advances in biomedical science enable us to understand lung diseases at the molecular level. Modern medicine has been empowered with the development of multiple approaches of pharmaceutical therapies, cell therapies, and bioengineering devices to treat respiratory diseases.\r\n Pulmonary physicians need to integrate the diverse areas in basic science and clinical research. We should conduct translational research that promotes the information exchange between \"bench\" and \"bedside\" and advances knowledge in both basic and clinical sciences. We should encourage ourselves to formulate challenging questions based on bedside observations, elucidating the fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms of disease processes using current science knowledge and technologies. We should also translate the scientifi c discoveries from basic research into clinical applications. New and improved therapeutic strategies can be developed based on biologic foundation.\r\n Effective national programs for respiratory disease control are urgently needed. Well-designed nationwide epidemiologic studies on the prevalence and morbidity of many respiratory diseases should be carried out to evaluate present and future disease burdens. Studies on genetic susceptibility to respiratory diseases among the Chinese population should be enforced to improve early diagnosis and intervention. Integration of clinical resources and multicenter research should be pushed forward to improve diagnosis and treatment.\r\n Community-based comprehensive intervention should be implemented to ensure the availability of medical resources, such as essential drugs, equipment, and human resources. The priorities and future directions will also include the organization of large-scale clinical trials and the development and update of guidelines on respiratory diseases.\r\n Finally, shortage of respiratory physicians remains a challenging problem.

Chinese guidelines on HAP and CAP have been developed. 3 The costs of caring for patients with COPD were equivalent to 110% of the annual income of rural residents and 34% of that of urban residents. Smoking, air pollution, biomass fuel use, and occupational dust exposure seem to account for the high COPD prevalence. 14 The ongoing hot research topics also include the role of infl ammation in COPD and the therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing the destruction of lung tissues. Although the Chinese guideline is widely available, 57 heterogeneity in the quality of care among centers, especially the disparity between urban and rural areas, has restricted the management of lung cancer in a more consistent way. 65 Genetic polymorphisms associated with PTE among the Chinese were characterized, and several genetic traits in fibrinogen b 66 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 67 were linked to an increased risk of PTE in the Chinese population. 68] [69] [70] Great efforts have been made to fi nd the optimal regimens for treating PTE. The new regimen signifi cantly reduces the cost of the treatment. 46 After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the Chinese government implemented a series of measures to strengthen its public health system. Interstitial lung diseases have been increasingly recognized in China. Sarcoidosis is the most studied interstitial lung disease. A substantial proportion of cancer-related deaths in China are attributed to lung cancer.

There remains a pressing need for additional pulmonary supportive care measures, especially techniques that do not require systemic anticoagulation. The objective of our experiments was to determine whether systemic oxygenation could be increased in a large animal, with induced hypoxia, by perfusing the abdominal cavity with oxygenated perfluorocarbons. Methods: Fifteen pigs with a mean (\u060e SD) weight of 45 \u060e 5 kg were intubated and rendered hypoxic by ventilating them with a blend of nitrogen and oxygen to achieve subatmospheric concentrations of inspired oxygen ranging from 18 to 10%, resulting in baseline mean PaO 2 range of 65.9 \u060e 9.7 to 26.6 \u060e 2.8 mm Hg, respectively. Peritoneal perfusion was performed in eight animals with oxygenated perfluorocarbon and in seven control animals with oxygenated saline solution.\r\n : The average increase in PaO 2 with oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfusion, compared to oxygenated saline solution perfusion, ranged from 8.1 to 18.2 mm Hg. A common treatment effect was estimated across all fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO 2 ) values, representing the average mean difference in oxygen uptake between oxygenated perfluorocarbon and saline solution, irrespective of the level of FIO 2 . This average was 12.8 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 7.4 to 18.2; p < 0.001). The most clinically relevant results occurred at an FIO 2 of 14%, resulting in a baseline mean PaO 2 of 39.4 \u060e 5.0 mm Hg with oxygenated saline solution perfusion, and a mean PaO 2 of 55.3 \u060e 7.6 mm Hg with oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfusion. This corresponded to an increase in arterial oxygen saturation from 73 to 89%. Conclusion: These results of our principle experiments demonstrate that the peritoneal cavity can be used for gas exchange and, in our model, yielded clinically relevant increases in systemic arterial oxygen levels. This technique may have the potential for the supportive care of patients dying from hypoxia in the setting of reversible lung injury.

Although multiorgan failure may result in the demise of a patient with any of these conditions, many patients die from isolated pulmonary insufficiency that is potentially reversible. The high mortality and increasing size of this population underscores the need for new and improved treatments for potentially reversible pulmonary failure.\r\n Supportive care with mechanical ventilation is the cornerstone of all treatment strategies for patients with severe pulmonary failure. Numerous modes and Original Research CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE parameters of mechanical ventilation can be adjusted in an effort to maximize gas exchange, but when these manipulations are no longer effective the clinician is left with very few options. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a well-established and effective technique to supplement pulmonary function. This modality, however, is a scarce resource that requires special expertise to institute and trained personnel to manage, and, primarily due to the need for systemic anticoagulation, is accompanied by its own set of morbidities and limitations. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Liquid ventilation, an attempt to improve the gas exchange capacity of diseased lungs by filling them with a gas-transporting fluid (perfluorocarbons), is an experimental modality that has yet to establish itself as a mainstream therapeutic option. 11, 12 Perfluorocarbons are inert, colorless, clear, nontoxic, fluorine-based organic compounds with extraordinary gas-dissolving properties. The solubility of O 2 and CO 2 in perfluorocarbons is typically in the range of 50 mL of gas per 100 mL of liquid and 200 mL of gas per 100 mL of liquid at 37\u00b0C, respectively. For comparison, the respective solubility of O 2 and CO 2 in saline solution at 37\u00b0C is 3 mL of gas per 100 mL of liquid and 57 mL of gas per 100 mL of liquid. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] The concept we wished to explore was whether it was possible to use the peritoneal membrane for gas exchange, which is analogous to the way in which this same surface can be used for solute and fluid exchange with peritoneal dialysis. It has been shown that significant oxygenation can be achieved in small rodents by filling the abdominal cavity with oxygenated saline solution or gaseous oxygen, but this effect has not been replicated in large-animal models. 18, 19 It is thought that the relative decrease in the peritoneal surface area, with increasing animal size, is responsible for this loss of effect. 20 Our hypothesis was that using perfluorocarbons for gas exchange, in a perfusion circuit that maintains a high oxygen gradient, might overcome the limitation of a relatively smaller peritoneal surface area and permit significant levels of oxygen exchange in a large animal. To test this hypothesis, for proof of principle, we designed a large animal-induced hypoxia model.\r\n Fifteen Sus scrofa pigs with a mean (\u03ee SD) weight of 45 \u03ee 5 kg were used for the experiments. All experiments were approved by the Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The care and handling of all animals were in accord with US Department of Agriculture guidelines.\r\n Anesthesia was induced in the animals with tiletamine hydrochloride (Telazol; Fort Dodge Animal Health; Fort Dodge, IA), 5 mg\/kg, injected IM, after which an IV catheter was placed in an ear vein and 30 mg of propofol (Baxter; Irvine, CA) was injected IV. The animals were then intubated with an endotracheal tube having a 7.5-mm internal diameter (Mallinckrodt Inc; St. Louis, MO) and maintained with isoflurane inhalation anesthesia, using intermittent propofol injections for any evidence of discomfort or awakening. The animals were placed on a mechanical ventilator (Dual Phase Control Respirator Pump; Harvard Apparatus; Holliston, MA) with a tidal volume of 10 to 15 mL\/kg and a rate of 12 to 15 breaths\/min. Prior to subjecting the animal to hypoxia, the respiratory rate was occasionally adjusted in an effort to maintain a neutral pH, as determined by arterial blood gas measurements. ECG leads were placed in the standard threelead positions on each animal, starting at the time of induction, and were continuously monitored throughout the experiment. Oxygen saturation was also measured with a pulse oximeter (Vet\/Ox Plus 4700; SDI; Waukesha, WI) with the probe placed on the tongue of the animal. Once under general anesthesia and in the supine position, a cervical cut down was performed through which a Swan-Ganz right heart catheter (Edwards Lifesciences; Irvine, CA) was placed via the internal jugular vein, and an 18-gauge angiocatheter was placed in the common carotid artery for access to the central arterial system for BP monitoring and arterial blood gas measurements. Both of these lines were transduced using a pressure-monitoring kit with a pressure transducer (TruWave; Edwards Lifesciences) that was connected to a monitor system (model 78834A; Hewlett-Packard; Palo Alto, CA) for monitoring the systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures and the central venous pressure.\r\n After placement of the arterial and venous lines, a midline laparotomy was performed. A 28F venous return cannula catheter (Edwards Lifesciences) was placed in the left paracolic gutter, brought out through a separate site in the left lower quadrant, and sutured in place using a No. 1 polypropylene suture (Prolene suture; Ethicon; Sommerville, NJ). A 42F venous return cannula (Edwards Lifesciences) was placed in an identical manner on the right side, with the tip lodged above the dome of the liver. The abdomen was then closed in a single layer with a running No. 1 polypropylene suture. In the first two animals in each experimental group, an additional 14F catheter (Edwards Lifesciences) was placed near the midline for pressure-monitoring purposes and was maintained in a vertical attitude, attached to a ruler such that the height of the column of fluid could be easily monitored. Peritoneal pressure measurements (expressed in centimeters of H 2 O) were calculated by multiplying column height by the correction factor 1.67 (specific gravity of trans-bis-perfluorobutyl ethylene).\r\n A anesthesia machine (Matrx; Orchard Park, NY) was used for blending gases and isoflurane-inhaled anesthetic. Pure nitrogen, rather than filtered room air, was mixed with pure oxygen to achieve subatmospheric concentrations of oxygen. The animal was ventilated using a standard bifurcated anesthesia circuit to maintain a unidirectional flow of the gases. A machine (Datex; Puritan-Bennett Corporation; Overland Park, KS) was attached to the ventilation circuit that allowed real-time monitoring of the oxygen and anesthetic agent concentrations. The oxygen and nitrogen tanks were connected to the circuit through a flowmeter (Matrx). The probe of the flowmeter was placed at the origin of the endotracheal tube, allowing for accurate determination of the respective flows of oxygen and nitrogen required to achieve the desired Fio 2 .\r\n The 42F venous return cannula, which was used to recover the perfusate from the abdomen, was connected to a 127 cm length of three eighths inch (internal diameter) tubing (Gish Biomedical; Rancho Santa Margarita, CA). This tubing was connected to a No. 10 filter housing (Clear Cold Water Filter Housing; Filter Store, Inc.; Mendon, NY) containing a 50-m pleated filter (Filter Store, Inc). After passing through the filter, the outflow drained by gravity into a custom built 10-L glass tank (Advanced Aquatanks; Los Angeles, CA). The outflow of the filter was placed 41 cm below the level of the operating table. A ceramic plate diffuser (Aquaculture Technology; Kitzbuhel, Austria) was placed at the bottom of the collection tank. This diffuser was designed for oxygenating ponds and gives off a steady stream of 10 to 200 m bubbles when being infused with oxygen at 30 pounds per square inch (psi) [based on product information from the company]. This diffuser was connected to a medical oxygen tank via one quarter inch (internal diameter) tubing (Gish Biomedical). The gauge on the tank was able to measure the oxygen delivered to the diffuser in psi. (A standard cardiopulmonary bypass \"lung\" cannot be used to oxygenate perfluorocarbon as the liquid is able to pass through hollow fibers.)\r\n Fluid was retrieved from the collecting tank with a 150-cm length of one quarter inch tubing that was connected to a piece of three eighths inch tubing that passed through a pump (Roller Blood Pump; Sarns, Inc; Ann Arbor, MI) that was used to control the flow rate. This outflow from the roller pump passed into a 43-cm length of one quarter inch tubing. This tubing was connected to the inflow end of a heat exchanger (ECMOtherm-II; Avecor; Minneapolis, MN). The heat exchanger was set to warm the abdominal perfusate to 39\u00b0C, which is normal body temperature for swine. This was accomplished using a circulatory heater (Haake; Berlin, Germany). After being warmed by the heat exchanger, the abdominal perfusate passed through a 63-cm length of one quarter inch tubing to the 28F inflow catheter. All tubing was standard cardiopulmonary bypass tubing. Thus, the circuit was as follows: abdomen, outflow catheter, filter, reservoir with oxygenator, pump, warmer, inflow catheter, and abdomen.\r\n After the cannulas were placed and the abdomen was closed, it was necessary to assure that the circuit was functional before initiating the progressive hypoxia sequence. Any perfusion circuit that is dependent on a siphon phenomenon for outflow may require manipulation of the outflow catheter to achieve optimal flow due to local geometric factors that can obstruct or occlude the catheter drainage ports. Through trial and error, we found that placing the outflow cannula above the liver yielded the fewest drainage problems. With the cannula in this location, it was never necessary to reopen the incision, but occasionally it was necessary to spin the catheter or move it several centimeters in or out to assure optimal flow.\r\n The reservoir was initially primed with 8 L of perfusate. Once the circuit was flowing smoothly, the inflow pump was adjusted to match the maximum outflow rate for that animal. This rate was empirically determined and unique for each animal, falling between 1.2 and 4.2 L\/min ( Table 2 ). Once optimization of the circuit was complete and the maximum flow rate for that animal was identified, the outflow catheter was clamped and the abdomen was allowed to fill with 5 to 7 L of fluid. Once this volume was infused into the abdomen, the inflow catheter was then clamped, thereby trapping the perfusate in the abdomen. In designing this model, we found that this maneuver, which did not affect the intraabdominal pressure, was necessary in order to assure that the siphon would resume and that the circuit could be restarted after having been stopped for several hours during the stepwise hypoxia portion of the experiments. Thus, in every case there was a large volume of perfusate, saline solution, or perfluorocarbon harbored in the abdomen during the collection of the \"circuit-off\" hypoxia measurements.\r\n Seventy liters of neat perfluorocarbon F44E (trans-bis-perfluorobutyl ethylene) were provided as a generous gift from Neuron Therapeutics, Inc (Malvern, PA). This perfluorocarbon is clear, colorless, odorless, and immiscible with water or blood, and has the physical characteristics listed in Table 1 .\r\n The experimental design is summarized in Figure 1 . The experimental groups included eight animals perfused with perfluorocarbon. The controls included seven animals in which saline solution was used as the perfusate (Table 2 ). In each case, the animals were stabilized at a fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio 2 ) of 21% for 30 min, and then were sequentially dropped to Fio 2 values of 18%, 16%, 14%, 12%, and 10% for 30 min at each level. Thirty minutes was an arbitrarily selected interval based on clinical observations that this interval would be sufficient to allow equilibration with a change in mechanical ventilation parameters. This time frame was also necessary due to the logistical constraints of the animal facility to keep the experiments to \u03fd 8 h. The desired Fio 2 was achieved by empirically adjusting the blend of nitrogen and oxygen to achieve the desired Fio 2 , as indicated by the in-line gas monitor (Datex; Puritan-Bennett Corporation).\r\n During the progressive hypoxia phase, as the Fio 2 descended from 18 to 10%, the circuit tubing remained clamped with 5 to 7 L of perfusate dwelling in the abdomen. Arterial and mixed venous blood gasses, along with heart rate and BP, central venous pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressures were obtained at each level. Blood gas measurements were performed (Gem Premier 3000; Instrumentation Laboratory; Lexington, MA). For the first two experiments in each group, the intraperitoneal pressure was also recorded, both before and during peritoneal perfusion. At the conclusion of the descending-Fio 2 phase (ie, after the animals had been at an Fio 2 of 10% for 30 min with the circuit off and the perfusate dwelling in the abdomen), the tubing was unclamped, and the peritoneal oxygenation circuit was activated at the previously determined flow rate. The volume of perfusate that remained in the abdomen during perfusion was also idiosyncratic, remained relatively stable with a stable flow rate, and ranged from 2 to 3 L. The ascending Fio 2 levels were achieved by resuming the same nitrogen and oxygen flow settings that had been used for the descending-Fio 2 phase. The animals were again allowed to equilibrate for 30 min during the ascending phase prior to collecting blood gas measurements. The oxygen supply to the bubbler was always maintained at 30 psi.\r\n Mixed-effects linear regression was used to model oxygen uptake as a function of treatment group (ie, perfluorocarbon vs saline solution groups), oxygenation condition (ie, oxygenation circuit off vs oxygenation circuit on), and Fio 2 . Heuristically, this approach fits a \"random\" regression line for the Pao 2 data of each animal as a function of Fio 2 . Then, it statistically averages these curves within each group and oxygenation condition to obtain the overall fixed (ie, average) effects. This method appropriately accounts for unbalanced data due to occasional missing measurements, as well as for the correlation of measurements obtained on the same animal. The interpretation of the fixed-effects estimates obtained from the linear regression model is similar to that of the usual linear regression (ie, in terms of mean Pao 2 values and mean differences). The analyses were conducted using a statistical software package (SAS, version 8.2; SAS Institute; Cary, NC [from 1999 to 2001]). Table 2 summarizes the groups of animals. The study included eight pigs in the experimental group (perfluorocarbon) and seven pigs in the control group (saline solution). All animals underwent the same experimental protocol with the exception that liquid was used as the perfusate. The measured intraperitoneal pressures for steady-state perfusion were \u03fd 15 cm H 2 O. The measured pulmonary artery pressures were 12 to 18 mm Hg and 4 to 8 mm Hg, respectively, for the two groups, and were unaffected by whether the perfusion circuit was running or the type of perfusate. No statistically significant difference was noted in the Paco 2 or venous Pco 2 between groups, irrespective of Fio 2 or whether saline solution or perfluorocarbon was used as the perfusate.\r\n During the experiments, the animals were observed at five different levels of Fio 2 (18%, 16%, 14%, 12%, and 10%) under two different conditions (circuit off or circuit on). A total of 132 measurements were obtained, 69 when the oxygenation circuit was off and 63 when the oxygenation circuit was on. Table 3 presents the observed and fitted mean Pao 2 values for all groups.\r\n For the saline solution group, with the circuit off and saline solution dwelling in the abdomen, as the Fio 2 was lowered from 18 to 10% the mean (\u03ee SD) Pao 2 decreased from 65.9 \u03ee 9.7 to 26.6 \u03ee 2.8 mm Hg, respectively. This provided fitted means of 66.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 61.0 to 72.5 mm Hg) to 22.7 mm Hg (95% CI, 17.0 to 28.3 mm Hg), respectively. After obtaining data for the animals at an Fio 2 of 10%, the oxygenation circuit was started. As the Fio 2 of the animals was raised from 10 to 18%, the mean Pao 2 increased from 28.6 \u03ee 3.9 to 60.5 \u03ee 11.6 mm Hg, respectively. This resulted in fitted mean values of 25.6 mm Hg (95% CI, 20.1 to 31.1 mm Hg) to 55.9 mm Hg (95% CI, 49.0 to 62.7 mm Hg), respectively. These results are depicted as fitted means in Figure 2 .\r\n Saline solution perfusion with the oxygenation circuit running was then compared to perfluorocarbon perfusion with the oxygenation circuit running (Fig 3) . The data from animals that had oxygenated saline solution perfusion were compared directly to those of animals that underwent perfusion with oxygenated perfluorocarbon. As the Fio 2 of the animals was raised from 10 to 18% with the circuit running with oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfused, the mean Pao 2 increased from 36. 7 (Fig 2) . The average increase in fitted mean Pao 2 with oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfusion compared to oxygenated saline solution perfusion ranged from 8.1 to 18.2 mm Hg. These differences represent the treatment effect comparing oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfusion to oxygenated saline solution perfusion. All five differ-ences are statistically significant. A common treatment effect can be estimated across all Fio 2 values, representing the average mean difference in oxygen uptake between perfluorocarbon and saline solution when the oxygenation circuit was running, irrespective of the level of Fio 2 (Table 4 ). This average was 12.8 mm Hg (95% CI, 7.4 to 18.2 mm Hg; p \u03fd 0.001).\r\n The above difference between perfluorocarbon and saline solution perfusion, when the oxygenation circuit was running, should be put in the context of the same difference when the oxygenation circuit was off and the perfusate was dwelling in the abdomen (Fig 4) . As mentioned above, when oxygenation was on, oxygen uptake was significantly higher in the perfluorocarbon group by 12.8 mm Hg on average (average difference of fitted mean Pao 2 values between perfluorocarbon and saline solution perfusion at all Fio 2 levels) [Fig 2] . When the oxygenation circuit was off and the perfusate was dwelling in the abdomen, oxygen uptake was also statistically significantly higher in the perfluorocarbon group than in the comparable saline solution group. The average mean difference in oxygen uptake between the perfluorocarbon and saline solution groups, when the oxygenation circuit was off and perfusate was dwelling in the abdomen, was 6.4 mm Hg (fitted mean 95% CI, 0.6 to 12.2 mm Hg; p \u03ed 0.034). When comparing the quantitative effects of the oxygenation circuit (ie, off vs on) between the groups (perfluorocarbon vs saline solution group) a positive group-by-oxygenation interaction effect was noted to be 6.4 mm Hg (95% CI, \u03ea1.2 to 14.0; p \u03ed 0.095).\r\n The most clinically relevant increase in Pao 2 came at an Fio 2 of 14% (Fig 2, 3) . The observed effect of perfluorocarbon compared to that of saline solution with the oxygenation circuit on demonstrated an observed mean increase of 15.9 mm Hg with a fitted mean increase of 13.2 mm Hg (95% CI, 7.8 to 18.6 mm Hg) [ Table 4 ]. This resulted in a baseline mean For the observed means, this corresponds to an increase in arterial oxygen saturation (Sao 2 ) from 73% with oxygenated saline solution perfusing the abdomen to 89% with oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfusing the abdomen.\r\n These results of our principle experiments represent the first demonstration of the ability to perform peritoneal perfluorocarbon perfusion in a large animal resulting in the augmentation of systemic arterial oxygenation. Small-animal studies 18 -21 have previously demonstrated the ability to use the peritoneal surface to deliver oxygen using intraperitoneal gaseous oxygen, oxygenated saline solution, or oxygenated perfluorocarbon, but promising results have not previously been reported in any large-animal studies. The relative ease with which oxygenation can be increased in small-animal models, but not largeanimal models, is likely a function of the significantly increased ratio of the peritoneal surface to body mass in small animals. 22 Based on our results, we hypoth- esize that a perfusion circuit, with a medium like perfluorocarbon that is capable of carrying and unloading large quantities of oxygen, is necessary to achieve significant gas exchange through the peritoneal surface of a large animal. The measured augmentation of systemic oxygen levels by perfusing the peritoneum with oxygenated perfluorocarbon was uniform and statistically significant for all five levels of induced hypoxia. It was the use of perfluorocarbon that resulted in the observed phenomenon, in our model, as saline solution failed to serve as an effective gas transport medium.\r\n The animals that had perfluorocarbon dwelling in their abdomen, during the progressive hypoxia phase of the experiments (Fig 1) , also had higher oxygen levels than the corresponding animals that had saline solution dwelling in their abdomens during this portion of the experiments (Fig 2, 4) . Our hypothesis to explain this consistent finding is that the volume of indwelling perfluorocarbon in the abdomen likely served as an oxygen reservoir and resulted in blunting of the induced hypoxia effect on arterial oxygen concentrations as the Fio 2 was decreased from 18 to 10%. Although we were unable to directly measure the oxygen content of the perfluorocarbon, the perfluorocarbon would have initially equilibrated with atmospheric air, a Po 2 of approximately 160 mm Hg, and could have held as much as 2.5 to 3.5 L of available oxygen. 14 -17 Given the rapidity with which gradient-driven gasses dissolve in perfluorocarbons and the fact that tissues extract essentially all oxygen from perfluorocarbons before extracting oxygen from hemoglobin, one would assume that the dwelling perfluorocarbon served as a renewable oxygen reservoir as the animals were rendered progressively hypoxic. 23 That is, in addition to serving as an initial oxygen reservoir, it is likely that the reservoir was relatively \"renewed\" as the animals progressed from higher to lower levels of inspired oxygen. For example, if an animal was at an Fio 2 level of 16%, the perfluorocarbon would equilibrate to the tissues at this level and would then be higher than the tissue levels when the Fio 2 was decreased to 14%, thereby serving as a source of oxygen at the 14% Fio 2 level.\r\n It is interesting to note that saline solution, dwelling in the abdomen or with the oxygenation circuit running, and perfluorocarbon, dwelling in the abdomen but without progressing to a lower Fio 2 , yielded essentially the same arterial oxygen concentrations at the lowest Fio 2 of 10% (Fig 2) . At this point, only activation of the oxygenation circuit, in the perfluorocarbon animals, resulted in increased arterial oxygen levels (Fig 2) . Examining the data at this lowest level of induced hypoxia is as close as we could come to eliminating the reservoir effect from our data. The necessity of maintaining a stagnant volume of perfusate in the abdomen during the progressive hypoxia measurements was a limitation of our experimental model. Another consistent trend, likely resulting from the limitations of our model, is the fact that all animals demonstrated their highest arterial oxygen concentrations at the initiation of the experiments, with the oxygenation circuits not running. Our experiments were designed to ferret out any potential effect from peritoneal perfusion. To magnify the effect from a gradient-driven phenomenon, we elected to drop the animals to the profound level of hypoxia induced by ventilating them with an Fio 2 of 10%. In retrospect, this degree of hypoxia is clinically irrelevant and likely placed the animals into a state of oxygen debt from which they could never recover during the ascending phase of the induced hypoxia measurements (Fig 1) . It is our hypothesis that this state of oxygen debt at the conclusion of the experiments is why all the animals demonstrated their highest levels of oxygenation at the beginning of the experiments, when they first entered a state of induced hypoxia (Fig 2) . We also feel that the parallel sequence of induced hypoxia increase and decrease, for both the saline solution and perfluorocarbon groups, is why the resulting data yielded parallel lines (Fig 2) for perfusate that was dwelling in the abdomen and perfusate that was circulating. Although the results of our principle experiments demonstrate that arterial oxygenation can be supplemented by instilling perfluorocarbon into the abdomen, partially with dwelling and more so by circulating oxygenated perfluorocarbon, it is important to view these results within the context of the short duration of the experiments, the peculiarities of our induced hypoxia model, and the statistically significant, but relatively small, sample size of our study. We designed this model to allow us to explore the effect of perfusion over a wide range of hypoxia. In order to specifically study the effects on oxygenation, we maintained the animals in a normocarbic state and, thus, cannot draw any conclusions regarding the impact of peritoneal perfluorocarbon perfusion to clear carbon dioxide. One could speculate, however, that the greater diffusivity of carbon dioxide compared to oxygen, and the very high solubility of carbon dioxide in perfluorocarbon would favor carbon dioxide clearance in a hypercarbic state.\r\n In considering peritoneal perfusion as a potential treatment for patients with reversible pulmonary failure, arterial oxygen levels in the 40 mm Hg range might represent the point at which a clinician would entertain instituting heroic measures for appropriate patients. This degree of hypoxia was achieved in our model at an Fio 2 of 14%, which resulted in a mean arterial oxygen concentration of 39.4 mm Hg with oxygenated saline solution perfusion, and an Sao 2 of 73%. Perfusing the abdomen with oxygenated per- fluorocarbon, compared to perfusing it with oxygenated saline solution, resulted in an average difference of 15.9 mm Hg of oxygen, which correlated with an average arterial oxygen level of 55.3 mm Hg. This corresponded to an average increase in the Sao 2 from 73 to 89%. Although our experiments were short term, and strictly proof of principle, it is worth noting that this degree of augmentation in oxygenation could represent a potentially life-saving measure in a patient dying from reversible pulmonary failure.\r\n The amount of oxygen delivery that we observed is significantly less than can be achieved with direct blood interface techniques, like extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Peritoneal perfusion, however, would not require anticoagulation, and this is a potentially significant advantage. For example, a trauma patient with an intracranial hemorrhage and pulmonary contusions or ARDS may require extrapulmonary oxygen delivery but would not be a candidate for any modality requiring anticoagulation.\r\n If further research reveals that this modality remains as innocuous for prolonged periods as we observed for these short-term proof-of-principle experiments, then there could be other roles for this modality beyond the salvage of a patient in terminal pulmonary failure. Another potential application would be to initiate this treatment in a prophylactic manner to prevent or limit ventilator-induced lung injury. 24 As a nonpulmonary technique for gas exchange, it could allow the clinician to decrease the toxic ventilator settings that are sometimes required to support a patient who is dying from potentially reversible lung failure. Such a technique could short circuit the \"catch-22\" that results when high ventilator settings exacerbate the underlying lung dysfunction and mandate even higher ventilator settings, further worsening the dysfunction. From a technical surgical perspective, it would not be difficult to institute this type of treatment at the bedside.\r\n The results from these proof-of-principle experiments demonstrate that systemic oxygen levels can be increased in a large-animal induced hypoxia model by perfusing the peritoneal surface with oxygenated perfluorocarbon. The gas-dissolving and gas-unloading properties of perfluorocarbon were necessary as the same effect was not obtained when saline solution was employed as the perfusate. Although supplemental oxygenation has been demonstrated in small animals (with their relatively larger peritoneal surface) by using various techniques to oxygenate the abdominal cavity, this is the first demonstration of investigators being able to consistently accomplish this objective in a large animal. Further studies are indicated and will take the form of longer duration peritoneal perfusion runs to look for toxic side effects of this treatment, the evaluation of the impact of this technique on carbon dioxide clearance, the performance of this technique in disease models that simulate human conditions of severe pulmonary failure, and the exploration of interventions that can enhance gas exchange across the peritoneal membrane. We speculate that this technique could potentially find a role in the supportive care of patients with profound, but reversible, pulmonary failure. As this is a pulmonary-independent technique for supplementing oxygenation, there could even be a role for treating patients with less severe, but worsening, pulmonary failure in order to prevent the compounding problem of ventilator-induced lung injury.","sha":"86b48dbedbb546bdf43a405dbaf73615ec5689cc","publish_time":"2006-08-31","authors":"Carr, Shamus R.; Cantor, Joshua P.; Rao, Atul S.; Lakshman, Thiru V.; Collins, Joshua E.; Friedberg, Joseph S.","journal":"Chest","doi":"10.1378\/chest.130.2.402","Title":"Chest","H index":267.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"P otentially reversible pulmonary failure secondary to diseases such as avian flu, ARDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and bacterial pneumonia claims many lives in the United States every year. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a well-established and effective technique to supplement pulmonary function. 11, 12 Perfluorocarbons are inert, colorless, clear, nontoxic, fluorine-based organic compounds with extraordinary gas-dissolving properties. The solubility of O 2 and CO 2 in perfluorocarbons is typically in the range of 50 mL of gas per 100 mL of liquid and 200 mL of gas per 100 mL of liquid at 37\u00b0C, respectively. 13] [14] [15] [16] [17] The concept we wished to explore was whether it was possible to use the peritoneal membrane for gas exchange, which is analogous to the way in which this same surface can be used for solute and fluid exchange with peritoneal dialysis. Fifteen Sus scrofa pigs with a mean (\u03ee SD) weight of 45 \u03ee 5 kg were used for the experiments. All experiments were approved by the Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The animals were then intubated with an endotracheal tube having a 7.5-mm internal diameter (Mallinckrodt Inc; St. Louis, MO) and maintained with isoflurane inhalation anesthesia, using intermittent propofol injections for any evidence of discomfort or awakening. Prior to subjecting the animal to hypoxia, the respiratory rate was occasionally adjusted in an effort to maintain a neutral pH, as determined by arterial blood gas measurements. Oxygen saturation was also measured with a pulse oximeter (Vet\/Ox Plus 4700; SDI; Waukesha, WI) with the probe placed on the tongue of the animal. 1 polypropylene suture (Prolene suture; Ethicon; Sommerville, NJ). The abdomen was then closed in a single layer with a running No. In the first two animals in each experimental group, an additional 14F catheter (Edwards Lifesciences) was placed near the midline for pressure-monitoring purposes and was maintained in a vertical attitude, attached to a ruler such that the height of the column of fluid could be easily monitored. The oxygen and nitrogen tanks were connected to the circuit through a flowmeter (Matrx). The 42F venous return cannula, which was used to recover the perfusate from the abdomen, was connected to a 127 cm length of three eighths inch (internal diameter) tubing (Gish Biomedical; Rancho Santa Margarita, CA). This tubing was connected to the inflow end of a heat exchanger (ECMOtherm-II; Avecor; Minneapolis, MN). Thus, the circuit was as follows: abdomen, outflow catheter, filter, reservoir with oxygenator, pump, warmer, inflow catheter, and abdomen. Once the circuit was flowing smoothly, the inflow pump was adjusted to match the maximum outflow rate for that animal. The experimental design is summarized in Figure 1 . The experimental groups included eight animals perfused with perfluorocarbon. At the conclusion of the descending-Fio 2 phase (ie, after the animals had been at an Fio 2 of 10% for 30 min with the circuit off and the perfusate dwelling in the abdomen), the tubing was unclamped, and the peritoneal oxygenation circuit was activated at the previously determined flow rate. This method appropriately accounts for unbalanced data due to occasional missing measurements, as well as for the correlation of measurements obtained on the same animal. The analyses were conducted using a statistical software package (SAS, version 8.2; SAS Institute; Cary, NC [from 1999 to 2001]). All animals underwent the same experimental protocol with the exception that liquid was used as the perfusate. The measured intraperitoneal pressures for steady-state perfusion were \u03fd 15 cm H 2 O. The measured pulmonary artery pressures were 12 to 18 mm Hg and 4 to 8 mm Hg, respectively, for the two groups, and were unaffected by whether the perfusion circuit was running or the type of perfusate. A total of 132 measurements were obtained, 69 when the oxygenation circuit was off and 63 when the oxygenation circuit was on. Table 3 presents the observed and fitted mean Pao 2 values for all groups. This resulted in fitted mean values of 25.6 mm Hg (95% CI, 20.1 to 31.1 mm Hg) to 55.9 mm Hg (95% CI, 49.0 to 62.7 mm Hg), respectively. These results are depicted as fitted means in Figure 2 . All five differ-ences are statistically significant. When comparing the quantitative effects of the oxygenation circuit (ie, off vs on) between the groups (perfluorocarbon vs saline solution group) a positive group-by-oxygenation interaction effect was noted to be 6.4 mm Hg (95% CI, \u03ea1.2 to 14.0; p \u03ed 0.095).

In our study, we observed the changes of lung lesions in discharged but undergoing rehabilitation SARS patients via lung function testing, lung imaging examination, and retrospective analysis of the disease course and therapy.\r\n The Record Board of Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital approved this study and the use of the case files. All patients gave informed consent.\r\n Our study extended from July 1, 2003 , to September 30, 2003 , and included 258 SARS patients discharged from Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital. The individual clinical diagnosis was based on the clinical diagnosis standard for SARS patients issued by Ministry of Chinese Public Health. All patients studied met the specified criteria for discharge. 3 The first follow-up visits for these patients were from July 1, 2003, to August 10, 2003 . Although most of these rehabilitating SARS patients were well enough to perform their daily activities in the follow-up study, they complained of limited physical ability from general weakness and\/or shortness of breath during the clinical follow-up. Being an entirely new entity, there was no literature to reference for guidance about the course of SARS; therefore, we relied only on performing follow-up pulmonary function testing, frontal chest radiography (CXR), and\/or high-resolution CT, and serum SARS-CoV IgG antibody examination in Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing.\r\n Approximately 1 month after the first follow-up, patients underwent pulmonary function testing, lung imaging, and serum SARS-CoV IgG antibody examination to observe the rehabilitative changes in the lung injury, and all examinations performed at the first follow-up visit were repeated at the second visit. The second follow-up was obtained on an average (\u03ee SD) of 33 \u03ee 7 days (range, 24 to 50 days) after the first visit.\r\n Each rehabilitating SARS patient underwent standard pulmonary function testing (Model 2200; SensorMedics; Yorba Linda, CA) for FEV 1 , vital capacity (VC), FVC, total lung capacity, diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco), and Dlco constant (Dlco\/Va) measured by means of the singlebreath test. The hemoglobin value was also taken for correcting the Dlco. The results were compared with those of age-and sex-matched control subjects and expressed as a percentage of predicted values. Pulmonary function was regarded as abnormal when Dlco was \u03fd 80% of the predicted value.\r\n CXR was performed at the first follow-up visit for every rehabilitating SARS patient. If CXR abnormalities were found or if the Dlco was \u03fd 80% of the predicted value despite a normal CXR, the patients were sent for HRCT scanning (GE Light-Speed; GE Medical Systems; Milwaukee, WI), 1-mm section in thickness with 10-mm gap, supine position, scanning during inspiration, 1 second per scan, 140 kilovolts, 200 mA). Three nonblinded radiologists with a viewing console assessed all CXR and CT images, with the final conclusions established by consensus. Each segment of the lung was reviewed for ground-glass opacification, interstitial thickening, bronchiectasis, and architectural distortion. Abnormalities were magnified by using a zoom function and were examined for intralobular interstitial, interlobular septal, or peribronchovascular interstitial thickening. The presence or absence of nodules or masses, cavitation or calcification, and emphysema was also noted. The presence of parenchymal bands, irregular interfaces (bronchovascular, pleural, or mediastinal), thickened interstitium, and traction bronchiectasis were evidence of fibrotic changes. 4\r\n SARS-CoV IgG antibody present in serum specimens of rehabilitating SARS patients was tested with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (No. S20030003; BGI-GBI Biotech Company; Beijing, ROC), and all specimens were tested at BGI-GBI Biotech Company. The wells with polystyrene microplate strips were coated with two recombinant SARS-CoV antigens that are well characterized. The serum was diluted in diluent buffer (1:10), incubated in the coated wells for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, and the wells were washed five times with washing buffer. The enzymelabeled antihuman IgG working dilution (100 L) was added, incubated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C, and washed five times with washing buffer. A tetramethyl-benzidine substrate was then added to each well. The presence of specific antibodies was indicated by the presence of a yellow color after substrate addition. Reaction was terminated by addition of hydrochloric acid. The intensity of the color was measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm in proportion to the amount of antibodies in the specimen. The optical density (OD) obtained on the y-axis was plotted against the lot-specific standard concentrations on the x-axis, resulting in a linear calibration curve. The OD values of the positive control and negative control were calculated. The cut-off value for IgG was 0.18, which was calculated as the mean \u03e9 2 SD of the readings given by 1,000 blood donor control sera. If the OD value was above the cut-off value, it indicated a positive result for SARS-CoV IgG. 5\r\n Total RNA from the examining sputum, urine, feces, and whole blood was extracted (QIAamp RNA Blood Mini Kit 52304; QIAGEN; Valencia, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The RNA was dissolved in 40 L of diethyl pirocarbonate-treated water containing 1 U of deoxyribonuclease I (Promega; Madison, WI). Nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was primarily used to ensure specificity. The size of the PCR product is 131 base-pairs \r\n We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed the data from the records of SARS patients from the onset and throughout the hospital stay, including the duration of persisting fever, total dosage of glucocorticoid, patients requiring supplemental oxygen, and number of noninvasive ventilation treatments.\r\n All data are expressed as mean \u03ee SD unless otherwise indicated. Statistical analyses were done by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Student-Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons. We used statistical analysis software (STATA 7.0 for Windows; StataCorp; College Station, TX) for evaluating the results of our study. With each statistical test, the level used to determine the significance was considered at a p value \u03fd 0.05.\r\n From July 1 to September 30, 2003, a total of 258 SARS patients were followed up at least twice after discharge. There were 107 men and 151 women with a mean age of 37.1 \u03ee 12.9 years (age range, 18 to 74 years). The mean time from discharge to first follow-up was 45.0 \u03ee 20.7 days (range, 11 to 104 days).\r\n Of the rehabilitating SARS patients, as expected, all samples tested negative for the viral RNA. In the serum SARS-CoV IgG antibody examination (each follow-up required serum SARS-CoV IgG antibody testing, and each serum sample was tested at least two times), positive results were seen in 208 patients (80.6%) and negative results were seen in 50 patients (19.4%). Of the patients with positive results, 53 patients (25.5%) had a pulmonary diffusion abnormality (Dlco \u03fd 80% predicted), and 2 patients (4%) with negative results had a pulmonary diffusion abnormality (Dlco \u03fd 80% predicted with one of them having a history of COPD with pulmonary fibrosis changes, the other with the history of organized pneumonia disease) [p \u03ed 0.001; Table 1 ]. The patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and Dlco \u03fd 80% predicted were older than the patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and Dlco \u0546 80% predicted and the patients with negative SARS-CoV IgG results (p \u03ed 0.0088; Table 2 ).\r\n Of the patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG antibody results and Dlco \u03fd 80% predicted, 51 of the 53 patients (96%) underwent pulmonary function testing at least twice, with the second follow-up appointment being on average 33 \u03ee 7 days (range, 24 to 50 days) after the first visit. Table 3 shows the results of pulmonary function testing (VC, FEV 1 , Dlco, and Dlco\/Va) during the second examination, revealing an improvement in scores compared to the first examination (Table 3) .\r\n There were residual abnormalities on the CXRs and HRCT imaging in 52 of the 258 SARS patients, mainly displaying interstitial thickening, (Table 4 ; Fig 1, 2) .\r\n During the course of SARS disease, the duration of fever in patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG antibody results and Dlco \u03fd 80% predicted was longer compared to the patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and Dlco \u0546 80% predicted and the patients with negative SARS-CoV IgG results. The doses of glucocorticoid used, the fraction of inspired oxygen concentration, and the number of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) treatment for patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and Dlco \u03fd 80% predicted also were higher than for the other patients (Table 5) . Of the 258 patients, none were intubated or received invasive mechanical ventilation, but 18 patients received NIPPV (Table 5 ).\r\n SARS-CoV infects the human body through the respiratory tract and replicates in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and pneumocytes. The host's immune response to SARS-CoV infection leads to lymphocyte production and to macrophage infiltra- tion into the alveolar septa and interstitial compartments. In patients with severe SARS, pulmonary lesions may progress into the proliferating and fibrosis phases. In the proliferating phase, cellular components such as myofibroblasts and fibroblasts produce collagen type III and collagen type I. 1, 6 In the rehabilitating phase, some patients still have lung fibrotic changes and complain of limited physical function from general weakness and\/or shortness of breath affecting their pulmonary functions and life quality. 7, 8 During follow-up visits, we found that the rehabilitating SARS patients did not express persistence of SARS virus infection, as detected by SARS-CoV RNA examination, and the results showed that the rehabilitating patients did not have infectivity. In our study, 50 of 258 patients (19.4%) showed negative SARS-CoV IgG antibody results in at least two examinations, hinting that they might have been misdiagnosed. Both the Chinese clinical diagnosis standard (2003) 3 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention SARS case definition (2003) 9 emphasize the importance of epidemiologic history, clinical manifestation, and CXR changes on clinically diagnosed SARS disease. In the laboratory test, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention SARS case definition especially emphasizes the importance on confirming SARS through detecting the dynamic changes of titrations of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV and positive detection of SARS-CoV RNA by PCR, but the Chinese clinical diagnosis standard does not mentioned the importance of laboratory SARS-CoV testing in SARS case confirmation. This might cause the existence of misdiagnosed SARS cases. Therefore, in the retrospective and follow-up study, we excluded these cases to ensure data accuracy. In our study, we found that there were 53 of 208 patients (25.5%) whose SARS-CoV IgG antibody results positive and also had a pulmonary diffusion abnormality (Dlco \u03fd 80% predicted). Analyzing the results of the second pulmonary function examination and comparing them to the results of the first showed that most of these patients (41 of 51 patients, 80.4%) had improved pulmonary diffusion function (p \u03ed 0.0003). Of the rehabilitating patients with pulmonary radiologic residue caused by SARS disease presenting as pulmonary fibrotic changes, 22 of 40 patients (55%) showed improvement on the HRCT scan in a month. This suggests that the mechanism of lung injury and lung fibrotic changes caused by SARS-CoV might have a different pathophysiologic process as compared to other diseases in the lung. SARS patients with lung fibrotic changes seem to have the ability of self-rehabilitation, and a pulmonary diffusion test might be more sensitive than HRCT on evaluating lung fibrotic changes (80.4% vs 55%). We think that the radiologic resolution of pneumonic process may lag behind the clinical picture. Although this study was limited to only approximately a 2-month followup, the lung function test reflected an earlier resolution of diffusion impairments compared with HRCT.\r\n Through retrospectively analyzing the data of SARS patients including the duration of persistent fever and treatment information, we found that the patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and Dlco \u03fd 80% predicted were older compared with the patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and Dlco \u0546 80% predicted and with negative SARS-CoV IgG results. The duration of fever, dosage of glucocorticoid usage, fraction of inspired oxygen, and number of NIPPV treatments in the patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and Dlco \u03fd 80% predicted were also longer. This may explain why older SARS patients had more severe symptoms than the younger patients. In spite of more aggressive therapy methods, the sequelae rates in the older rehabilitating SARS patients presented higher rates of lung fibrotic changes. 10, 11 In conclusion, SARS is associated with considerable rates of morbidity and mortality in the acute phase. A significant proportion of patients surviving the acute illness have impairment in overall functional capacity and health status in the first few months after discharge from the hospital. However, the long-term effect is still largely unknown.

Glucocorticosteroid administration for acute lung injury (ALI) or ARDS arising from critical SARS remains controversial, as does for ALI or ARDS arising from other etiologies. Many studies have looked into the use of corticosteroids in SARS management in terms of efficacy, duration, dose, and severe adverse events; however, further investigations are needed to characterize the treatment efficacy and safety profiles of steroids in this condition. 3 Some authors 4 -6 implied that large-dose steroids were indicated during the early phase once a diagnosis was made, to prevent further deterioration, while some others [7] [8] [9] thought that large-dose therapy was not advisable although steroids could help. Open clinical trials 6,9 -14 also demonstrated that pulse steroid therapy could reduce mortality without associating an increased rate of life-threatening complications. Unfortunately, all of these studies are selfcontrolling based; therefore, they are not convincing due to lack of control groups in study design, as the natural history and progression of SARS were yet unclear at time of study.\r\n In Guangzhou, Guangdong Province of China, the city where SARS epidemic first broke out, the condition had been managed as community-acquired pneumonia before SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was confirmed as the pathogen. When complicated with ALI, some patients were administered steroids empirically based on treatment of ALI\/ARDS arising otherwise, other than on any available evidences or guidelines. The time has arrived when efficacy and safety profiles of steroid therapy have to be reviewed with more recent data. In this study, we set up a database of Guangzhou SARS cases and evaluated SARS-related steroid therapy through a retrospective study, expecting to characterize the efficacy and safety profiles of steroid therapy in Guangzhou by multivariate analysis.\r\n From December 2002 through June 2003, there were 1,278 registered cases of clinically diagnosed SARS admitted to hospitals in Guangzhou, China, among which we screened for those strictly fulfilling the criteria issued by the World Health Organization for confirmed identification of SARS, 15 and also with at least one of the following conditions: (1) seroconversion or a fourfold rise (or higher) in SARS-IgG during days 10 to 14 or later after onset; (2) a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result for SARS-CoV confirmed by two or more laboratories during acute phase. Four hundred one of the 1,278 patients met the criteria and were enrolled in this study.\r\n Database Setup: The case records of all SARS patients were reviewed by our investigators and input into a database (Excel;\r\n Microsoft; Redmond, WA) statistically designed with uniform fields including patient demographic data, contact history, etiologic investigations, SARS-IgG, SARS-PCR, underlying diseases, symptoms and signs, chest radiography, laboratory investigations, complications, medications and interventions, prognosis, and cause of death.\r\n Evaluation of Chest Radiography: Each side of lung field was divided into 9 zones by anatomic thirds from upper to lower and from lateral to medial parts, such that there were 18 zones in total on both sides. 16 Each zone was scored 1 through 4 based on the degrees of pulmonary opacities (1 \u03ed hazy, 2 \u03ed medium density, 3 \u03ed high density, 4 \u03ed consolidation), and the sum of these 18 subscores was defined as the total score for pulmonary abnormalities in radiography. Then the total score of pulmonary abnormalities was compared with the previous chest radiograph to determine the tendency of chest radiography abnormality. The tendency of chest radiography abnormality was classified as progressed (1 \u03ed 25% increase in total score), stable (2 \u03ed \u03fd 25% change in total score), and improved (3 \u03ed 25% reduction in total score). Two senior radiologists evaluated and scored the chest radiographs independently and contributed to the mean total radiographic score for each case.\r\n Recognition of the Onset: Day 1 of the disease was marked by the first time of fever as reported by the patient or confirmed by measurement.\r\n Calculation of the Steroid Doses: Corticosteroid therapy in our study included aggressive treatment for critical patients and rescue regimen for worsened cases. The dosage of steroids was calculated only up to week 3 from onset in an attempt to circumvent calculation of rescue use of very high dosage of corticosteroid before the death of the patients. We defined the rescue use of corticosteroid as the sudden increase of dosage after 3 weeks from the onset and 3 days before the patients died. In this way of calculation, we were able to include 87.3% of the total dosage of corticosteroid and avoid four cases of rescue use of corticosteroid with daily dosage from 1,000 to 2,000 mg of methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone was the major steroid used in most of the patients, while a small percentage were treated with hydroprednisone or dexamethasone, the doses of which were converted into methylprednisolone equivalents by 25 mg of hydroprednisone\/4 mg of methylprednisolone and 0.75 mg of dexamethasone\/4 mg of methylprednisolone.\r\n Recognition of Complications: Complications in our study referred to those occurring during the course of treatment and associated with progression of SARS or treatment interventions. Major complications included pneumothorax, mediastinal emphysema, myocardial injury, arrhythmias, hyperglycemia, high BP, hypokalemia, secondary lower respiratory or extrapulmonary infections, and GI tract hemorrhage.\r\n Recognition of Secondary Lower Respiratory Infections: Secondary lower respiratory infections in the SARS patients were recognized when one of the following was met: (1) histologic evidence of bacterial or fungal infections in lungs; (2) presentation of pneumonia, with pathogen isolated from blood or pleural effusion identical to result of sputum culture; (3) after 2 weeks in the time course of SARS, under the condition of resolution of fever, significant clinical improvement and obvious resolution on chest radiograph, recurrence of fever, cough, and sputum as well as newly development of lung infiltrate on chest radiograph were observed; and (4) apparent purulent sputum, leukocytosis, and confirmed pathogen in sputum by two consecutive culture findings. 17, 18 Recognition of Myocardial Injury: Myocardial injury was referred to as one time or above increase in creatinine kinase-MB.\r\n Recognition of Extrapulmonary Infection: The criteria for the determining secondary extrapulmonary infection were as follows: (1) bacteria or fungi infection in a site other than lower respira-tory tract proved by pathology; (2) same isolate of two consecutive culture findings from extrapulmonary fluid.\r\n The method of determining baseline values of all time-dependent variables of a patient were as follows: (1) for a steroid-treated patient, the median of daily recorded values during the 3 days prior to his\/her first steroid dosage; or (2) for a nonsteroid-treated patient, the median of daily recorded values during the 3 days prior to a specific day, which was the median of the length of time from disease onset to the first steroid dosage among all steroid-treated patients.\r\n Definition of Critical SARS: The diagnosis of critical SARS was made according to the criteria of SARS guidelines issued by Ministry of Public Health of China, 19 incorporating a low oxygenation index (OI) [\u03fd 300 mm Hg]. In other words, SARS manifestations matching those of ALI were diagnosed as critical SARS; cases otherwise were deemed noncritical.\r\n Statistical Analysis: Statistical software (SPSS 11.0; SPSS; Chicago, IL) was employed for statistical analysis. Measurement data were summarized by mean \u03ee SD. Analysis of variance and 2 test were used for univariate testing, while forward stepwise (conditional) logistic regression and Cox regression were used for multivariate analysis. Primary end points were death caused by SARS and hospital discharge of the survivors. All variables possibly affecting the primary end points were included in univariate analysis to screen for potential confounders, which were further processed in logistic regression and Cox regression. The significance level \u2423 in univariate analysis was set at 0.1 so that some variables might not be overlooked during this stage. The use of steroid was further evaluated for its relationship with case fatality and hospitalization days with a significance level \u2423 \u03ed 0.05. In analysis concerned with hospitalization days, only those survival cases were used to avoid the confounding effect of death.\r\n There were 249 noncritical and 152 critical cases among 401 enrolled SARS patients. General characteristics of the patients were shown in Table 1 .\r\n Steroid therapy for SARS patients in Guangzhou was heterogeneous, with 59.0% of noncritical patients and 79.6% of critical patients receiving steroids, and the time to initiate the first steroid dosage in all steroid-treated patients was 5.01 \u03ee 3.48 days from disease onset.\r\n There were 25 deaths in 152 critical SARS cases. All of the 249 noncritical patients survived the disease. The risk factors related to death and the days of hospitalization were analyzed.\r\n The candidate risk factors were found by univariate analysis through comparison between the non-critical and critical cases and between the survivors and deaths of critical cases (Tables 1-3) .\r\n Two logistic regressions were performed, with death and complication as end points, respectively, and the use of steroid as well as the above-mentioned potential confounders as independent variables.\r\n Regression for Case Fatality: A logistic regression based on the data of 401 SARS cases with death (yes\/no) as end point showed no significant difference in case fatality between steroid-and nonsteroid-treated patients. However, the result of a logistic regression based on the data of 152 critical SARS cases showed that steroid therapy significantly reduced the case fatality among critical SARS patients after the death-related variables were adjusted, such as age, rigor at onset, secondary lower respiratory infection, pulmonary rales, and OI grading (1, \u03fd 100; 2, \u0546 100 and \u03fd 200; 3, \u0546 200 and \u03fd 300; and 4, \u0546 300). The odds ratio (OR) of case fatality between steroid-treated patients and nonsteroid-treated patients was 0.083 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.007 to 0.956) [ Table 4 ].\r\n Both logistic regressions based on the data of 401 SARS cases and 152 critical SARS cases with at least one complication (yes\/no) as an end point showed no significant difference in complication presentation between steroid-and nonsteroid-treated patients after adjusting for invasive ventilation (Table 5) .\r\n Case Fatality: Based on the data of 401 SARS cases, Cox regression with death (yes\/no) as an end point failed to show significant difference in survival time since the first time of fever between the two groups. However, based on the data of 152 critical SARS cases, the result of Cox regression showed that use of steroids reduced the odds of case fatality among critical SARS patients ( Table 6 ). The odds of case fatality among steroid-treated patients was 0.37 times as much as that among nonsteroid-treated patients after the variables of using invasive ventilation and age were adjusted ( Table 5 ). The effect of steroids on survival time was shown in Figure 1 . On day 40, the survival rates among steroid-and nonsteroid-treated patients were 96.3% and 92.3%, respectively.\r\n Hospital Discharge: Based on the data of survivors (376 cases) among 401 SARS cases, analysis of hospitalization days of survivors by Cox regression did not show significant difference between patients receiving steroids or not. However, based on the data of survivors (127 cases) among 152 critical SARS cases, the results of a Cox regression showed that the number of hospitalization days was reduced by steroid therapy after the variables of complication presentation was adjusted. The odds of earlier discharge among steroid-treated patients was 1.74 (95% CI, 1.025 to 2.964) the odds of being discharged among nonsteroid-treated patients ( Table 7) . The effect of steroids on hospitalization days is shown in Figure 2 .\r\n As a new emerging infectious severe respiratory disease, the diagnosis and management of SARS attracts much attention. There have been many publications on its diagnosis and management. Most of the previous reports used clinically oriented criteria for case identification, which was not specific and prone to overdiagnosis. The positive rate of convalescent antibody was reported 77.7% by Tian et al, 20 and 85.7% by Gao et al. 21 In a study of 70 patients (all of them were health-care workers) with definite contact history and typical presentation, Chen 22 was able to show a 100% seroconversion or a fourfold rise in serum SARS-IgG in convalescent phase. The above-mentioned information suggested that diagnosis of SARS based on clinical information alone might cause overdiagnosis. In our study, we reviewed only cases confirmed by virology to avoid bias from inclusion of unconfirmed cases.\r\n Since no SARS-specific treatment has been developed, management of this disease remains clinically based and supportive. Importantly, acute respiratory failure typically seen during the late phase of critical SARS, mainly presenting with dyspnea and hypoxia, meets the diagnostic criteria for ALI. For this reason, steroid therapy in critical SARS has become a focus of interest. After the report of clinical experience of expert panel 23 from Guangzhou, there have been several reports on steroids therapy in critical SARS, and also no lack of controversy as to their outcomes and usage. Ho et al 6 compared 17 cases receiving high-dose pulse methylprednisolone therapy (ie, 500 mg\/d for 5 to 7 consecutive days, then tapered to 20 mg\/d over a total course of 21 days) with 55 cases receiving low-dose non-pulse corticosteroid (equivalent to approximately 2 to 3 mg\/kg\/d of methylprednisolone) therapy. It was reported that patients receiving high-dose pulse corticosteroid had less oxygen requirement, better radiographic outcome, and less likelihood of requiring subsequent highdose pulse corticosteroid therapy than their counterparts. There was no significant difference between the two groups in severe secondary infections. However, in the study by Ho et al, 6 there was no control (receiving no corticosteroid) group. 4 Zhao and colleagues 4 compared the clinical outcome of four treatment protocols in 190 cases of SARS. It was Table 4 for expansion of abbreviation. suggested that on the basis of antibiotics and antivirals (ribavirin and recombinant interferon-\u2423), early high-dosage steroids (160 to 1,000 mg\/d of methylprednisolone) resulted in best outcomes and no death as compared with low-dose steroid therapy. However, this was not a randomized controlled study. Patients admitted in different periods received different treatment protocol, and major confounders affecting the outcome of SARS were not adjusted with multivariate analysis. The study by Meng et al 7 indicated that early administration of steroids was helpful for symptom relieving and pulmonary resolution. It was shown that low-dose methylprednisolone (40 to 80 mg\/d) was associated with significantly shorter hospital days vs high-dose drug (320 to 640 mg\/d). Sung et al 9 reported the outcome a stepwise treatment protocol of steroid administra-tion in the treatment of SARS in Hong Kong. The initial treatment was broad-spectrum antibiotics, a combination of ribavirin and low-dose corticosteroid. (Table 6 ). Table 4 for expansion of abbreviation.\r\n Nevertheless, there were also opposite opinions. Data from Li et al 24 showed that high-dose steroids further deteriorated the low level of CD4 \u03e9 , CD8 \u03e9 , and CD3 \u03e9 , giving rise to severe secondary infections. Lee et al 25 reported the effect of steroid therapy on SARS-CoV load. Serial plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations were measured using a one-step real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR assay targeting the nucleocapsid gene. It was found that plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations in the second and third week of illness were significantly higher in patients who received initial hydrocortisone treatment (n \u03ed 9), as compared to those who received placebo (n \u03ed 7) [area under the curve; Mann-Whitney, p \u03ed 0.023]. An increase in the 30day mortality associated with high-dose steroids was also implicated by Tsang et al. 26 The variability of results from all the studies may lie in several reasons. First, some of the cases in the above-mentioned articles 20, 21 were of seronegative SARS-IgG, which were responsible for a bias due to overdiagnosis. In our study, only 401 of 1,278 registered cases in Guangzhou fulfilled the criteria of case identification instituted by World Health Organization. Second, the matching of SARS cases was not strictly controlled in these studies. As was shown in present study, noncritical SARS was not associated with mortality, but 59.0% of the patients received steroid therapy. Mixing the noncritical and critical SARS information together would interfere with the ability of statistical analysis to evaluate the effects of steroid on mortality. This might be the reason that steroid showed no efficacy on mortality in SARS patients as a whole but was significantly effective in critical (Table 7) . Cum \u03ed cumulative. SARS. Third, the adjustment of confounders was crucial in minimizing the effects of incomparability of baseline condition. In the present study, much more attention was paid to adjustment of baseline condition of important confounders. After adjusting the confounders with multivariate analysis, it was shown that proper use of steroid resulted in less fatality, lower instant mortality, and fewer hospital days.\r\n The mechanisms of corticosteroid in the management of SARS are unclear. As the clinical manifestations and diagnosis criteria for critical SARS are largely identical to those of ALI, the only difference being that critical SARS is definitely caused by SARS-CoV infection, whereas ALI may result from a variety of etiology, including infective and noninfective. The mechanism of corticosteroid in critical SARS might share the similarity with ALI\/ARDS. In ARDS, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] excessive systemic inflammation has been documented, in which, nuclear factor-B may be responsible for glucosteroid resistance, leading to relative adrenal insufficiency and subsequently aggravation of ARDS. Replacement with exogenous methylprednisolone may relieve the symptoms by ameliorating systemic inflammation. 30 Therefore, current opinion holds that steroid therapy in ARDS should be given only on the basis of relative adrenal insufficiency induced by systemic inflammation and oriented to suppression of systemic inflammation. The duration of steroids depends on the length of inflammation. In a word, the proper guideline for steroid administration in ALI\/ARDS include initializing appropriate doses of steroids at time of relative adrenal insufficiency, which was reflected in our study in terms of the steroid use. However, steroids should not be delayed until ARDS is fully developed. Advanced ARDS with apparently severe pathology will set back the efficacy of steroids.\r\n In a cohort study by Peiris et al, 33 it was found that from a view of viral replication and inflammatory response, the clinical progression of SARS presented a triphasic pattern. The early phase was characterized by systemic symptoms related to the effect of viral replication. As the disease progressed into the mid-phase, systemic inflammatory response syndrome became prominent, giving rise to systemic inflammatory response syndrome-induced lung injuries (ALI or ARDS) and many complications during the late phase. It was noted that the timing of the IgG seroconversion that started on day 10 seemed to correlate with falls in viral shedding from nasopharynx. Severe clinical worsening also occurred at this time, possibly related to immunopathologic damage. The presence of immunopathologic damage was confirmed by Jiang et al 34 in their study that interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) was markedly elevated in the blood during the early stage of SARS, and remained at a high level until convalescence; moreover, IP-10 was highly expressed in both lung and lymphoid tissues, in which monocyte-macrophage infiltration and depletion of lymphocytes were observed. The clinical worsening during the midphase of SARS may be a result from the immunopathologic damage due to overexuberant host response, which can be reduced by steroids. In a recent study 35 on cytokine profile of SARS patients, marked elevation of T-helper type 1 cytokine interferon-\u2425 and inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, (IL)-6, and (IL)-12 was showed for at least 2 weeks after disease onset. Corticosteroid reduced significantly IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and IP-10 concentrations from days 5 to 8 after treatment, confirming the activation of Thelper type 1 cell-mediated immunity in SARS through the accumulation of monocytes\/macrophages and neutrophils. In another study, 36 IL-10, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u2425 were higher than normal before treatment, and corticosteroid treatment resulted in fall in IL-10 but not in IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u2425. These data suggested that steroid therapy showed advantages in reducing inflammatory response and protection from lung injury.\r\n It is well known that corticosteroid therapy is a double-edged sword. As pointed out in the study by Lee et al, 25 early corticosteroid treatment might be associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load. As no data are published so far showing the benefit of corticosteroids in SARS during the early phase when SARS-CoV replication is ongoing, there is no evidence for a lopsided wish to use steroids in SARS as early as possible and also for high-dose administration regardless the severity of the disease, until the exact mechanism of steroids therapy is further elucidated.\r\n The potential benefits of steroid therapy in critical SARS included improving pulmonary oxygenation, reducing the need for intubation, case fatality, and pulmonary fibrosis. However, our study revealed only reduced fatality and shorter hospital stay in critical SARS, and failed to demonstrate the other advantages related to steroid administration. Future studies are needed to elucidate these effects using animal models and randomized prospective casecontrolled clinical trials.\r\n The adverse effects of steroids have been acknowledged elsewhere, including hyperglycemia, high BP, hypokalemia, immunocompromise, and superinfection. These effects depend on various factors, ie, the underlying diseases, age, severity, other interventions, as well as the dose and duration of steroids. In our study, secondary infection SARS was shown only related to the employment of invasive ventilation but not statistically related to the use of steroids. Nevertheless, monitoring and prevention of secondary infection and other complications are strictly indicated during steroid therapy.\r\n Another noticeable problem about steroids lies in its relationship with avascular osteonecrosis (AVN) in SARS convalescents. In a cluster sampling survey of health-care workers from four hospitals in Guangzhou, Shen et al 37 found that the rate of AVN was 3.2% (4 of 124 cases), which was much lower than other reports 38 -40 in correlation with the maximal single-day dose of steroids. The low incidence of AVN in SARS cases in Guangzhou may be related to the comparatively low dose and short duration of steroid use in this region.\r\n In addition to steroids, the fatality of critical SARS may be affected by many other relevant factors. Multivariate analysis in our study showed that elder age, rigor at onset, secondary lower respiratory infections, pulmonary rales, and use of invasive ventilation were related to higher fatality. The contribution of invasive ventilation to increased fatality may arise from increased rate of complications or from those with more serious condition per se.\r\n In conclusion, our retrospective study of Guangzhou SARS cases demonstrated less fatality, shorter hospitalization days, and no significant effect on lower respiratory infections in confirmed critical SARS patients when corticosteroids were administered properly. These findings supported rational use of steroids in critical SARS with an OI \u03fd 300 mm Hg.","sha":"b3d6444a660e3756cfa2ae4a72f3aa096ae1db06","publish_time":"2006-06-30","authors":"Chen, Rong-chang; Tang, Xiao-ping; Tan, Shou-yong; Liang, Bi-ling; Wan, Zhuo-yue; Fang, Ji-qian; Zhong, Nanshan","journal":"Chest","doi":"10.1378\/chest.129.6.1441","Title":"Chest","H index":267.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Glucocorticosteroid administration for acute lung injury (ALI) or ARDS arising from critical SARS remains controversial, as does for ALI or ARDS arising from other etiologies.

In conclusion, our retrospective study of Guangzhou SARS cases demonstrated less fatality, shorter hospitalization days, and no significant effect on lower respiratory infections in confirmed critical SARS patients when corticosteroids were administered properly."},{"Unnamed: 0":35,"Unnamed: 0.1":35,"doc_id":"db8cc9ec8d77e82cbe290ba2a494549b5ff1bfbe","title":"The Role of Infection in Interstitial Lung Diseases A Review","abstract":"publicly funded repositories, such as the WHO COVID database with rights for unrestricted research re-use and analyses in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source.

Idiopathic ILDs include idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), acute interstitial pneumonia, idiopathic lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP), and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. ILD can also present as a manifestation of an underlying systemic illness, such as in connective tissue disease (CTD) or sarcoidosis, and can also result from occupational, environmental, or drug exposures (pneumoconiosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or drug-induced ILD). Parenchymal lung diseases of infectious nature are generally excluded from the classification of ILDs. However, the potential role of infectious agents in the development of certain ILDs of unknown cause, such as IPF, continues to be of concern and remains to be clarified. Furthermore, it appears likely that the phenomenon of \"acute exacerbation\" (AE), which can worsen the clinical course of fibrotic ILDs, is in part associated with infections. Diagnostic evaluations of patients with suspected ILD also need to consider infections, since they can cause various histopathologic patterns commonly associated with ILDs including NSIP, LIP, organizing pneumonia, and eosinophilic pneumonia, among others (Table 1) . This is particularly important, since immunosuppressive agents are commonly used in the treatment of ILDs. Moreover, in recent years, there have been several studies examining the role of antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of ILDs (especially IPF), including in the setting of AE.\r\n Most research looking at the role of infections in the pathogenesis of ILD and as triggers of AE focus on viruses; the role of bacteria is less well studied. Recent microbiological molecular techniques using the 16s sequence of bacteria to identify strains have allowed evaluation of alterations in the lung microbiome and its association with disease processes, including pulmonary fibrosis. [1] [2] [3] In this narrative review, we explore the relevance of infections in the development of ILDs, as triggers of acute exacerbation phenomenon, and in the diagnosis of ILDs.\r\n The pathogenesis of IPF, the most common form of ILD, is largely unknown. IPF is characterized by the histopathologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia, which manifests as a temporally and geographically heterogeneous pattern of parenchymal fibrosis. 4 Many experts theorize that repeated episodes of alveolar injury in a predisposed host with dysfunctional healing mechanisms are central to the development and progression of IPF. 5, 6 Environmental factors that are thought to contribute include dust, particulate exposures, aspiration of gastric contents, and infection. [5] [6] [7] No definitive evidence exists to support the causal role of infections in the pathogenesis of IPF. Moreover, during AEs, infectious triggers are identified in only a minority of patients (possibly due to limitations of testing methods). In the setting of IPF and IPF with AE, we present evidence that supports a possible association with infection that does not necessarily imply cause and effect. Moreover, many of the studies presented further on were carried out in an era when immunosuppressive agents (such as systemic corticosteroids) were commonly used in the treatment of ILDs, and thus the data with respect to infections must be interpreted accordingly.\r\n Several studies have pointed toward an association between viruses and IPF, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). It has been theorized that these viruses provide a persistent antigenic stimulus in predisposed hosts, leading to fibrosis. Evidence from animal (murine) models shows that infection with gamma-herpesvirus can induce fibrosis and exacerbate established fibrosis, evidenced by increased total lung collagen, acute lung injury (ALI), histopathologic diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and reduced lung function. 8, 9 The most frequently identified virus appears to be EBV. 10, 11 Egan et al 12 showed in vivo EBV replication (localized to pulmonary epithelial cells) in 70% of patients with IPF vs 9% of control subjects. Importantly, the patients evaluated were classified as immunocompetent, and the majority had not received IPF-targeted therapy at the time of the biopsy procedure. Tang et al 11 attempted to show the association between chronic viral infection and IPF. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, they found one or more herpesviruses more frequently in patients with IPF vs control subjects (97% of the 33 patients with IPF vs 36% of control subjects (P < .0001)). These viruses included CMV, EBV, human herpesvirus-7 [HHV-7], and HHV-8. They found that herpesviruses were found more frequently in patients with sporadic cases of IPF than in familial cases (P < .05), supporting the role of these viruses as triggers or in the pathogenesis of IPF. 11 Yonemaru et al 13 studied patients with ILD (43 cases of IPF, seven cases of CTD-ILD, 22 cases of sarcoidosis) and emphysema (17 cases) and compared CMV, EBV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza serologies. They showed that CMV IgG, complement fixation, and EBV IgG titers were significantly higher in patients with IPF and CTD-ILD compared with the other groups. In contrast, adenovirus and parainfluenza titers demonstrated no significant difference among the groups. Interestingly, in these patients, increased CMV IgG and complement fixation suggests that latent CMV infection may be more prominent in ILD, giving further credence to the theory that such pathogens act as a chronic antigenic stimulus for lung injury. 13 Some speculate that the pathogen load required to trigger the cascade of inflammation and ultimately fibrosis may be too small for our tests to identify. To test this hypothesis, Santos et al 14 used immunohistochemical analysis in 37 patients with IIPs who underwent open lung biopsy procedures. CMV and measles were detected in patients with both IPF and NSIP and histopathologic DAD.\r\n Kuwano et al 15 studied the presence of adenovirus DNA in patients with CTD-ILD and IPF. They used molecular techniques to identify the adenovirus genome in transbronchial biopsy specimens from 19 patients with IPF, 10 patients with CTD-ILD, and 20 patients with sarcoidosis. Adenoviral DNA was present in 16% of patients with IPF, 50% of patients with CTD-ILD, and 10% of patients with sarcoidosis. Patients who had received corticosteroids were more likely to be positive for the adenovirus DNA, suggesting that the immune status of the host plays a significant role and that adenovirus is not truly associated with the pathogenesis of ILD or as a trigger of AE. 15 HCV causes liver fibrosis, and a number of case reports have suggested the possibility of its role in the development of IPF. Ueda et al 16 studied 66 patients with IPF and showed that 28% had positive serum antibodies to HCV vs 3% of control subjects (9,464 healthy volunteers). Arase et al 17 studied a cohort of 6,150 patients with HCV and 2,050 patients with hepatitis B virus. In the HCV group, they noted a 10-and 20-year cumulative incidence of IPF of 0.3% and 0.9%, respectively, compared with zero cases of IPF in the hepatitis B virus group. The study concluded that age, smoking, and liver cirrhosis enhance the development of IPF in HCV-positive patients. 17 However, a number of other studies have failed to replicate this association. 18 The lack of a consistent signal among various cohorts suggests that HCV is unlikely to be an important trigger for the development of IPF. 2 \r\n Bacteria have been less well studied in the realm of IPF. Richter et al 19 19 It is currently difficult to determine whether patients with IPF are more susceptible to infection or colonization due to abnormal lung parenchyma, associated traction bronchiectasis, and immunosuppressive medications (which historically have been commonly used for treatment of ILDs), or whether bacteria are involved as triggers of AE or in the pathogenesis of IPF.\r\n A 1989 study from Israel found that the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis in chronic ILD (mostly IIP) was 4 1 \/ 2 times higher than in the general population, and corticosteroid therapy was not found to be a confounding factor. 20 This finding is thought to be related to an increased susceptibility to atypical infections as a result of abnormal lung parenchyma, rather than a trigger in the evolution of ILD.\r\n The lung microbiome has also been an area of research in relation to various respiratory conditions. 2 Molyneaux and Maher 21 analyzed BAL samples from 25 patients with IPF using culture-independent metagenomic analysis. They found the phylum Firmicutes (Streptococcus and Veillonella species), Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were most commonly encountered. Such data demonstrate that the lower airways (once thought to be sterile) are colonized with microbial communities that can possibly be involved in the pathogenesis or progression of lung injury and ultimately fibrosis. 21 The same authors were able to show by longitudinal analysis of patients with IPF serum and BAL samples that specific genes, some of which coded for antimicrobial peptides, were present in patients with IPF and such expression increased over time, supporting the theory that pathogens may provide chronic antigenic stimuli in patients with IPF. 22 Fungi Even less information is available about the potential role of fungi in the pathogenesis of IPF or in AE of IPF. On occasion Pneumocystis jirovecii is detected as a factor associated with acute deterioration. 23 Other studies have also suggested that a significant rate of colonization with P jirovecii occurs in patients with IPF and other ILDs. For instance, Vidal et al 24 documented a 38% colonization rate with P jirovecii in patients with IPF.\r\n Infectious causes need to be considered in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected IIP, since the histopathologic patterns of lung injury underlying some IIPs can also be seen in pulmonary infections (Table 1) . 25 These patterns include NSIP, organizing pneumonia, DAD, lymphoid (lymphocytic) interstitial pneumonia (LIP), and pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE). Thus, it is imperative that infection be excluded in diagnosing these forms of IIP.\r\n NSIP is characterized histopathologically by varying degrees of interstitial chronic inflammation or fibrosis (or both) that appears temporally homogeneous with inconspicuous or absent fibroblastic foci. 4, 25 This pattern of lung injury can be encountered in various clinical contexts. The diagnosis of idiopathic NSIP requires exclusion of identifiable causes. For example, NSIP is the most common form of ILD found in patients with CTDs, that is, as a form of CTD-associated ILD. 26 In their initial description of NSIP, Katzenstein and Fiorelli 27 postulated that this form of lung injury may represent a result of prior ALI including infections. It has been known that NSIP can be encountered in HIV-positive patients with or without P jiroveci pneumonia. 28, 29 NSIP has also been encountered as a pattern of lung involvement in viral infections such as human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1. 30 Organizing pneumonia is a nonspecific response to a wide array of lung injury including infections. It is histopathologically characterized by the presence of organizing polypoid intraluminal plugs of granulation tissue within the alveolar spaces and ducts with varying degrees of bronchiolar involvement. 4, 25 Similar to idiopathic NSIP, the diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia entails exclusion of potential causes, including infections, aspiration and other inhalational injuries, drugs, CTDs and other systemic inflammatory disorders. 4, [31] [32] [33] [34] In a retrospective study of 254 cases of organizing pneumonia pattern confirmed on lung biopsy specimens, 59 cases (23%) were related to pulmonary infections. 31 An organizing pneumonia pattern of lung injury can be seen with many forms of pulmonary infections, including bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic. [33] [34] [35] It seems likely that even some cases diagnosed as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia that have a self-limited clinical course represent resolving pulmonary infection. 36 DAD is the histopathologic pattern underlying an acute form of IIP-acute interstitial pneumonia-and most cases of ARDS. 4, 25, 37 It is characterized histopathologically by the presence of hyaline membranes, along with diffuse alveolar septal thickening, septal edema, and interstitial fibroblast proliferation. This pattern can be encountered in patients with various forms of ALI. 4, 37, 38 Acute interstitial pneumonia (Hamman-Rich syndrome) refers to DAD occurring in the absence of an identifiable cause. 4, 37, 38 In one study looking at patients with DAD, the majority of cases were thought to have potential triggers identified. In this study of 58 consecutive cases of DAD confirmed by surgical lung biopsy results, 13 cases (22%) were thought to be infection related, most commonly viral pneumonias. 38 Idiopathic LIP is currently classified as a rare form of IIP along with idiopathic PPFE. 25 Histopathologically, LIP manifests diffuse infiltration of the alveolar septa with mostly lymphocytes and varying numbers of plasma cells. 4 The idiopathic form of LIP is indeed rare and outnumbered by those cases associated with disorders of immunodeficiency, CTDs, and other autoimmune disorders. 4, 25, [39] [40] [41] Similar to NSIP, LIP can be seen in HIV-positive patients and has also been associated with several viral infections, including EBV, HHV-8, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1. [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] PPFE is a recently delineated entity and is characterized histopathologically by elastotic fibrosis involving the pleura and adjacent subpleural parenchyma. 25 This process predominantly affects the upper lobes, in contrast to IPF. Several underlying disease processes have been implicated in cases of PPFE, including infections (eg, Mycobacterium and Aspergillus). A history of recurrent infections has been described in some patients with PPFE, raising the possibility that it may result from infection-related lung injury. PPFE can also be seen as a rejection phenomenon in recipients of allogeneic lung or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, drug or occupational exposures (asbestos, aluminum), chemotherapy, radiation, underlying autoimmune disease, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Idiopathic PPFE is a very rare form of IIP and may be associated with a genetic predisposition as a form of familial interstitial pneumonia. 25, [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] Sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder of unknown cause and is diagnosed by a combination of chestjournal.org clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic findings. Infection has been proposed as a trigger leading to an aberrant inflammatory cascade in a predisposed host. Given the lack of histopathologic specificity in diagnosing sarcoidosis and the wide spectrum of its clinical manifestations, it is difficult to identify a common cause in such a diverse disorder. 55, 56 Mycobacterium is the most commonly implicated species. Although Mycobacterium has not been demonstrated in sarcoid granulomas by culture or acidfast stains, immunohistochemical studies have shown remnants of the mycobacterial cell wall within sarcoid specimens. [57] [58] [59] In addition, PCR and nucleic acid testing have demonstrated mycobacterial nucleic acid in up to 80% of sarcoid specimens. A meta-analysis found that mycobacterial DNA\/RNA was identified in 26% of sarcoid tissues, which was significantly higher than in nonsarcoid tissues of control subjects. 58, 60, 61 Propionibacterium has also been implicated in sarcoidosis and has been cultured in up to 78% of sarcoid specimens. 58, 62 It is important to note that P acnes is a commensal bacterium and has been cultured in a large proportion of healthy control subjects. Eishi et al 62 found Propionibacterium through real-time PCR in 106 of 108 patients with sarcoidosis but also found the species in up to 60% of control subjects. A systematic review of 58 studies (> 6,000 patients) found a link between sarcoidosis and both P acnes, and mycobacteria. 63 Herpesvirus has also been implicated, although viruses have not been known to trigger granulomatous reactions. 64 Various other pathogens studied, including Borrelia, Rickettsia helvetica, Chlamydia pneumoniae, EBV, and retroviruses, were not associated with sarcoidosis. These studies support, but do not confirm, the theory that various antigens can stimulate granulomatous inflammation in a predisposed host and that the microorganism acting as the trigger can vary. 63 Currently available antibiotics can target enzymes encoded by microbial genes found to be present in sites of granulomatous inflammation in sarcoid specimens. 58,65 A randomized placebo-controlled trial in patients with chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis who were randomized to receive concomitant levofloxacin, ethambutol, azithromycin, and rifampin vs placebo for 8 weeks demonstrated reduced diameter of sarcoid skin lesions and overall clinical improvement in the treatment arm. 66 The same regimen was used in 15 patients with chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis with encouraging outcomes, including improved FVC, functional capacity, and quality of life. 67 The same group is pursuing this regimen in a larger cohort of patients to confirm their findings (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01169038). Use of antimicrobial agents directed against target enzymes may be an innovative treatment alternative. 68 There is also evidence that sarcoidosis may be transmissible; bone marrow transplants from donors with sarcoidosis have resulted in granuloma formation in recipients. 69, 70 Although this does not directly support infection, it supports the theory of an antigenic stimulus leading to granuloma formation.\r\n Whether sarcoidosis is a result of active or latent infection or is an abnormal response to remnants of a cleared or partially cleared infection are theories that continue to be debated. Infections may act simply as a stimulus for an aggressive inflammatory reaction in a predisposed host. In such predisposed hosts, there can be more than one type of antigenic stimulus leading to the clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis.\r\n There are other less common forms of ILD in which the role of infection deserves mention. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is generally thought of as an acute respiratory illness of unknown cause. [71] [72] [73] In recent years, cigarette smoking and medications have been identified as the inciting agents in a subset of patients with acute eosinophilic pneumonia. [74] [75] [76] It should also be recognized that acute eosinophilic pneumonia can be of infectious origin, as seen in fungal pneumonias-for example, coccidioidomycosis, and parasitic infections. 74, 76 Since corticosteroids are frequently used in the treatment of idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia, it is crucial for a possible infectious origin to be considered.\r\n Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features is a recently described entity that comprises a cohort of patients with ILD and features of autoimmunity (extrapulmonary and serologic) but do not meet criteria for established CTDs. Such patients pose a difficult question with respect to the role of immunosuppressive therapy. Little is known about the pathogenesis of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features or indeed the role of infection in this patient population.\r\n Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a diffuse lung disease characterized by an alveolar filling process with amorphous lipoproteinaceous surfactant-like material. Most cases of PAP represent an autoimmune disease mediated by the development of anti-granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor neutralizing antibodies. 77, 78 These antibodies induce a functional deficiency of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, which is a critical mediator of surfactant protein and lipid homeostasis in the alveoli. A minority of PAP cases are considered secondary forms, caused by exogenous agents or hematologic disorders. Nocardiosis is a well-recognized infection that can complicate the course of patients with PAP. 79 In addition, P jiroveci, mycobacteria, and CMV have also been reported to induce PAP. [77] [78] [79] Acute Exacerbation in ILDs\r\n The natural course of patients with ILD is not fully understood and, in part, depends on the type of underlying ILD. Especially in the fibrotic ILDs, AE accounts for significant morbidity and mortality. [80] [81] [82] Although no consensus definition for AE-ILD exists, the generally accepted criteria are extrapolated from the IPF population given the similarities in presentation. AE is generally characterized by acutely (typically < 1 month) worsening dyspnea and parenchymal infiltrates on imaging. It can occur in many forms of ILD and is histologically characterized by DAD in most cases. 83, 84 Such episodes are an important cause of ILD-related mortality, with a 3-month survival of < 50% in patients with IPF. 81, 85, 86 The various populations studied, evolving definitions of AE, and the retrospective design of the majority of studies make it difficult to assess the true frequency and sequelae of respiratory worsening in these patients. The theory that infection plays a role in the pathogenesis of the underlying disease, as well as in triggering AEs, has not been fully evaluated, but there is some data to support this concept in the current literature.\r\n The true incidence of AE by any definition is unclear, and reports range from 4% to 30% per year. 81 Differences in definitions and in the cohorts studied largely explain this variation. Most of the current data are derived from retrospective studies, and most clinical trials estimate a lower incidence of AE (4%-15%), perhaps due to more strict definitions used for inclusion. 81, 85 The definition of AE in IPF has been broadened in the most recent expert recommendations. 81, 87 Historically, AE excluded those with infection and other \"reversible\" conditions (ie, heart failure, venous thromboembolism).\r\n Despite advancements in diagnostic methods, infection in patients with ILD remains difficult to diagnose. Bronchoscopy, although quite specific in diagnosing infection, is relatively insensitive, particularly in the context of recent antibiotic use. 88, 89 Given our inability to definitively rule infection in or out, it is not practical to define AE by the exclusion of infection. Thus, the newly accepted definition includes AE with or without an identifiable trigger such as infection (Table 2 ). In the majority of patients with respiratory decline, no trigger can be identified, and the progression of the underlying ILD remains the most likely cause. However, the host response to an external stimulus may be important. Specifically, infections as antigens may play a role in triggering some fraction of exacerbations. 81 Additionally, the histopathologic finding of DAD in patients with AE leads to the natural correlation with ALI\/ARDS. The causes of ALI (histopathologic DAD) are numerous and are also thought to include infection, aspiration, toxins, transfusion, and surgery. 4, 38 Many of these triggers may lead to events that are indistinguishable from idiopathic exacerbations of ILD. 81 The role of bronchoscopy should be a clinical decision made on a case by case basis. Those with AE may have a tenuous respiratory status, and bronchoscopy may risk worsening this. In the setting of empirical antibiotic therapy and extensive laboratory investigations looking for identifiable triggers, bronchoscopy specifically looking for infection may not be necessary in all patients with AE. The risk of the procedure in this population, when weighed against the uncertain yield, makes it difficult to recommend for every patient, since its effect on outcomes remains unclear. The current evidence also does not support mandating other investigations when searching for possible triggers of AE (eg, specific blood work or serologic tests), clinical judgment must be used to determine appropriate and exhaustive testing looking for reversible triggers of AE, for example, testing for opportunistic pathogens in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents or testing for endemic pathogens.\r\n Data from small retrospective studies report an infectious cause as a trigger for 10% to 30% of AEs in patients with non-IPF fibrotic lung diseases. 85 One larger study of 220 patients with ILD (100 cases of IPF, 120 cases of non-IPF) showed that 20% of patients were diagnosed with infection in the setting of acute respiratory worsening. 82 There are also postmortem studies examining this issue: One such study of 42 patients with IPF who underwent autopsy showed that 15% had an infection identified (including fungal, bacterial, and viral). 90 Another study found that 28.8% of patients with AE had bronchopneumonia (fungal; 13.5%; CMV, 11.5%; and bacterial, 9.6%) identified postmortem and not diagnosed clinically. 91 Such studies highlight difficulties in diagnosing infection in this clinical setting and further support the recent revisions to the definition of AE.\r\n Although, infectious causes are found in 10% to 30% of patients with AE, identifying infection has not yet been demonstrated to affect outcomes. 85 For example, Blivet et al 23 reported that in six of 10 patients with confirmed treatable pathogens (including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza A, and P jiroveci), outcomes were not affected and mortality remained high despite antibiotics targeting these organisms. Of the two patients in whom P jiroveci was identified, only one patient's condition improved with antipneumocystis therapy. 23 The patients who did the best in this cohort were those with noninfectious reversible causes of respiratory worsening, that is, pneumothorax and complications of anesthesia. in 15 patients with AE: HSV (n \u00bc 1), EBV (n \u00bc 2), and torque teno virus (TTV) (n \u00bc 12). TTV was significantly more common in patients with AE and ALI compared with stable control subjects. Overall, the presence of a common respiratory virus was not detected in most patients with AE; however, the presence of TTV in a significant minority of the AE and ALI cohort may be important and an area for future study. 92 The results suggest that the presence of TTV is not specific for AE but may be associated with ALI in general. Konishi et al 93 also failed to identify gene transcription profiles that would be expected in viral infections in both patients with IPF and patients with IPF with AE. 2, 93 Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection has been known to cause exacerbation of asthma and COPD. A prospective study was conducted to investigate the possible role of C pneumoniae infection in triggering AE of IPF. Sputum, blood cultures, and acute and convalescent serologic tests for C pneumoniae IgG and IgA (ELISA) were performed prospectively in 27 patients over a 5-year period. Only two patients had an antibody response suggestive of acute or reactivated infection, suggesting that Chlamydophila is an unlikely trigger for AE of IPF. 94 Although existing data do not support the role of infection\/viruses in all cases of AE, or even in a majority, the possibility of viruses as a trigger remains to be explored. 87, 92 Unlike other respiratory conditions in which exacerbations are truly acute events, the onset of an AE in ILD is generally more insidious. It is possible, therefore, that by the time of clinical presentation, any triggering viruses would no longer be detectable. 2 Moreover, a significant proportion of patients with AE may have occult infection despite a vigorous clinical workup. 95 There is also some epidemiologic support for infectious causes of AE, which comes from studies that demonstrate AE occurring more frequently in winter and spring months 96 and in patients taking immunosuppressive medications. Song et al 86 showed in their study of patients with IPF that there was an increased risk of opportunistic infections, possibly attributable to prior treatment with chronic corticosteroid therapy or other immunosuppressive agents. 86 A polymorphism of the mucin (MUC5B) gene has been associated with both familial and sporadic IPF and is essential in mucosal immune defense. 97 In healthy individuals, the mucociliary escalator constitutes an important innate pulmonary defense mechanism. In contrast to cystic fibrosis in which impaired mucociliary clearance predisposes to AEs, mucociliary dysfunction of the peripheral airways has not been directly shown to cause AE-ILD, even though recent studies implicate the mucin gene in the pathogenesis of several ILDs. 98, 99 Attempts to implicate specific pathogens in the etiopathogenesis of AE have not often been successful; no association has been shown between AE and any specific organism. 84 Accumulating evidence suggests a multiple-hit hypothesis leading to progressive deterioration of lung function, 100 with infections being possible contributors to such \"hits.\" The prognostic implications of AE are profound; data suggest that up to 46% of deaths from IPF are preceded by an AE. 81 The median survival of patients with IPF who experience an AE is approximately 3 to 4 months, 81 so further research in this area is crucial, both to clarify the role of infection in respiratory worsening\/AE and to evaluate the role of the lung microbiome and chronic infectious stimuli in the pathogenesis of ILDs.\r\n Although bacteria have been less commonly implicated in the pathogenesis of ILDs, they have been studied in the setting of AE as well as in antimicrobial trials. Most experts would agree with empirical antibiotic treatment in the setting of AE given the potential benefit and minimal risk to the patient, 101 as occult infection remains a possibility.\r\n The efficacy of azithromycin in treating IPF was studied in a prospective open-label study: 20 patients with AE received azithromycin in addition to high-dose pulse steroid therapy. Outcomes were compared with a historical cohort treated with fluoroquinolone agents (n \u00bc 56). The primary end point of mortality at 60 days was significantly lower in patients treated with azithromycin (mortality, 20% vs 70%; P < .001), and no serious adverse events were observed. 102 Whether these findings are attributable to azithromycin's antiinflammatory effects, antimicrobial effects, or a combination of both, cannot be ascertained from such studies and remains an area to be investigated.\r\n A placebo-controlled study evaluated the prophylactic use of co-trimoxazole for 12 months compared with usual care for patients with fibrotic IIP. Although there were significant dropouts in the co-trimoxazole arm (30% vs 8% in placebo arm), post hoc analysis suggested that co-trimoxazole led to a reduction in infections and mortality. 103 There are ongoing clinical trials looking at co-trimoxazole therapy in IPF (ClinicalTrials. gov NCT01777737).\r\n Polymyxin-B-immobilized fiber column (PMX) helps remove endotoxins and is used for the treatment of endotoxemia. Several studies from Japan have reported an improvement of oxygenation in patients with ALI\/ ARDS treated with PMX. 104, 105 Given that DAD is the most common pathologic finding in ALI\/ARDS and in AE, treatments targeting ALI\/ARDS may have relevance in the management of AEs. A retrospective study aimed at clarifying this in patients with IPF with AE showed a significant improvement in the PaO 2 to FiO 2 ratio with PMX treatment. 106 However, the improvements in oxygenation did not translate into a survival benefit, as 1-and 3-month survival rates (70% and 34%, respectively) of patients with IPF with AE remained low. 106 A more recent retrospective Japanese study suggests that survival in those patients who received PMX may have been improved. 107 PMX is not a currently accepted treatment for AE-ILD, but such research may support the role of infections as antigenic stimulus in the setting of AE.\r\n The role of infection in the pathogenesis of ILD and AE-ILD remains unclear and needs further exploration. The current literature suggests that infections may play a role in the complex interaction between a susceptible host and the environment, leading to the development or progression of ILD. Given the overlap in histopathologic manifestations of infections and ILDs, infectious causes should always be considered in a patient with suspected ILD prior to institution of immunosuppressive therapy. Moreover, infections become a more significant concern when patients with ILD receive chronic immunosuppressive medications as treatment for their ILD. Recent studies suggest a potential role for antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of AE as well as ILD itself.","sha":"db8cc9ec8d77e82cbe290ba2a494549b5ff1bfbe","publish_time":"2017-10-31","authors":"Azadeh, Natalya; Limper, Andrew H.; Carmona, Eva M.; Ryu, Jay H.","journal":"Chest","doi":"10.1016\/j.chest.2017.03.033","Title":"Chest","H index":267.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) comprises a broad and heterogeneous spectrum of pulmonary parenchymal disorders of known and unknown causes.

Parenchymal lung diseases of infectious nature are generally excluded from the classification of ILDs. Furthermore, it appears likely that the phenomenon of \"acute exacerbation\" (AE), which can worsen the clinical course of fibrotic ILDs, is in part associated with infections. This is particularly important, since immunosuppressive agents are commonly used in the treatment of ILDs. IPF is characterized by the histopathologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia, which manifests as a temporally and geographically heterogeneous pattern of parenchymal fibrosis. 5] [6] [7] No definitive evidence exists to support the causal role of infections in the pathogenesis of IPF. Moreover, many of the studies presented further on were carried out in an era when immunosuppressive agents (such as systemic corticosteroids) were commonly used in the treatment of ILDs, and thus the data with respect to infections must be interpreted accordingly. Several studies have pointed toward an association between viruses and IPF, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). It has been theorized that these viruses provide a persistent antigenic stimulus in predisposed hosts, leading to fibrosis. 8, 9 The most frequently identified virus appears to be EBV. 10, 11 Egan et al 12 showed in vivo EBV replication (localized to pulmonary epithelial cells) in 70% of patients with IPF vs 9% of control subjects. They found that herpesviruses were found more frequently in patients with sporadic cases of IPF than in familial cases (P < .05), supporting the role of these viruses as triggers or in the pathogenesis of IPF. Interestingly, in these patients, increased CMV IgG and complement fixation suggests that latent CMV infection may be more prominent in ILD, giving further credence to the theory that such pathogens act as a chronic antigenic stimulus for lung injury. 13 Some speculate that the pathogen load required to trigger the cascade of inflammation and ultimately fibrosis may be too small for our tests to identify. Kuwano et al 15 studied the presence of adenovirus DNA in patients with CTD-ILD and IPF. 15 HCV causes liver fibrosis, and a number of case reports have suggested the possibility of its role in the development of IPF. In the HCV group, they noted a 10-and 20-year cumulative incidence of IPF of 0.3% and 0.9%, respectively, compared with zero cases of IPF in the hepatitis B virus group. 2 \r\n Bacteria have been less well studied in the realm of IPF. Richter et al 19 19 It is currently difficult to determine whether patients with IPF are more susceptible to infection or colonization due to abnormal lung parenchyma, associated traction bronchiectasis, and immunosuppressive medications (which historically have been commonly used for treatment of ILDs), or whether bacteria are involved as triggers of AE or in the pathogenesis of IPF. The lung microbiome has also been an area of research in relation to various respiratory conditions. They found the phylum Firmicutes (Streptococcus and Veillonella species), Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were most commonly encountered. On occasion Pneumocystis jirovecii is detected as a factor associated with acute deterioration. Thus, it is imperative that infection be excluded in diagnosing these forms of IIP. The diagnosis of idiopathic NSIP requires exclusion of identifiable causes. It has been known that NSIP can be encountered in HIV-positive patients with or without P jiroveci pneumonia. It is histopathologically characterized by the presence of organizing polypoid intraluminal plugs of granulation tissue within the alveolar spaces and ducts with varying degrees of bronchiolar involvement. 4, 25 Similar to idiopathic NSIP, the diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia entails exclusion of potential causes, including infections, aspiration and other inhalational injuries, drugs, CTDs and other systemic inflammatory disorders. This pattern can be encountered in patients with various forms of ALI. 38 Idiopathic LIP is currently classified as a rare form of IIP along with idiopathic PPFE. 25, [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] Sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder of unknown cause and is diagnosed by a combination of chestjournal.org clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic findings. These studies support, but do not confirm, the theory that various antigens can stimulate granulomatous inflammation in a predisposed host and that the microorganism acting as the trigger can vary. 58,65 A randomized placebo-controlled trial in patients with chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis who were randomized to receive concomitant levofloxacin, ethambutol, azithromycin, and rifampin vs placebo for 8 weeks demonstrated reduced diameter of sarcoid skin lesions and overall clinical improvement in the treatment arm. 66 The same regimen was used in 15 patients with chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis with encouraging outcomes, including improved FVC, functional capacity, and quality of life. 67 The same group is pursuing this regimen in a larger cohort of patients to confirm their findings (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01169038). Infections may act simply as a stimulus for an aggressive inflammatory reaction in a predisposed host. There are other less common forms of ILD in which the role of infection deserves mention. Most cases of PAP represent an autoimmune disease mediated by the development of anti-granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor neutralizing antibodies. Nocardiosis is a well-recognized infection that can complicate the course of patients with PAP. 81 Differences in definitions and in the cohorts studied largely explain this variation. Most of the current data are derived from retrospective studies, and most clinical trials estimate a lower incidence of AE (4%-15%), perhaps due to more strict definitions used for inclusion. Those with AE may have a tenuous respiratory status, and bronchoscopy may risk worsening this. 85 One larger study of 220 patients with ILD (100 cases of IPF, 120 cases of non-IPF) showed that 20% of patients were diagnosed with infection in the setting of acute respiratory worsening. Konishi et al 93 also failed to identify gene transcription profiles that would be expected in viral infections in both patients with IPF and patients with IPF with AE. A prospective study was conducted to investigate the possible role of C pneumoniae infection in triggering AE of IPF. 94 Although existing data do not support the role of infection\/viruses in all cases of AE, or even in a majority, the possibility of viruses as a trigger remains to be explored. The prognostic implications of AE are profound; data suggest that up to 46% of deaths from IPF are preceded by an AE. 81 The median survival of patients with IPF who experience an AE is approximately 3 to 4 months, 81 so further research in this area is crucial, both to clarify the role of infection in respiratory worsening\/AE and to evaluate the role of the lung microbiome and chronic infectious stimuli in the pathogenesis of ILDs. Although bacteria have been less commonly implicated in the pathogenesis of ILDs, they have been studied in the setting of AE as well as in antimicrobial trials. Outcomes were compared with a historical cohort treated with fluoroquinolone agents (n \u00bc 56). A placebo-controlled study evaluated the prophylactic use of co-trimoxazole for 12 months compared with usual care for patients with fibrotic IIP. 103 There are ongoing clinical trials looking at co-trimoxazole therapy in IPF (ClinicalTrials. Recent studies suggest a potential role for antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of AE as well as ILD itself."},{"Unnamed: 0":36,"Unnamed: 0.1":36,"doc_id":"f08835899b02695e0a65c811e82a5cf40d5e1a97","title":"Chronic Cough Due to Chronic Bronchitis ACCP Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines","abstract":"Background: Chronic bronchitis is a disease of the bronchi that is manifested by cough and sputum expectoration occurring on most days for at least 3 months of the year and for at least 2 consecutive years when other respiratory or cardiac causes for the chronic productive cough are excluded. The disease is caused by an interaction between noxious inhaled agents (eg, cigarette smoke, industrial pollutants, and other environmental pollutants) and host factors (eg, genetic and respiratory infections) that results in chronic inflammation in the walls and lumen of the airways. As the disease advances, progressive airflow limitation occurs, usually in association with pathologic changes of emphysema. This condition is called COPD. When a stable patient experiences a sudden clinical deterioration with increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, and\/or worsening of shortness of breath, this is referred to as an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis as long as conditions other than acute tracheobronchitis are ruled out. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to chronic bronchitis, and to make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. Methods: Recommendations for this section of the review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms \"cough,\" \"chronic bronchitis,\" and \"COPD.\" Results: The most effective way to reduce or eliminate cough in patients with chronic bronchitis and persistent exposure to respiratory irritants, such as personal tobacco use, passive smoke exposure, and workplace hazards is avoidance. Therapy with a short-acting inhaled \u2424-agonist, inhaled ipratropium bromide, and oral theophylline, and a combined regimen of inhaled long-acting \u2424-agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid may improve cough in patients with chronic bronchitis, but there is no proven benefit for the use of prophylactic antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, expectorants, postural drainage, or chest physiotherapy. For the treatment of an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, there is evidence that inhaled bronchodilators, oral antibiotics, and oral corticosteroids (or in severe cases IV corticosteroids) are useful, but their effects on cough have not been systematically evaluated. Therapy with expectorants, postural drainage, chest physiotherapy, and theophylline is not recommended. Central cough suppressants such as codeine and dextromethorphan are recommended for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing. Conclusions: Chronic bronchitis due to cigarette smoking or other exposures to inhaled noxious agents is one of the most common causes of chronic cough in the general population. The most effective way to eliminate cough is the avoidance of all respiratory irritants. When cough persists despite the removal of these inciting agents, there are effective agents to reduce or eliminate cough.\r\n (CHEST 2006; 129:104S-115S)","text_body":"ment of the British Medical Research Council Respiratory Questionnaire on Respiratory Symptoms. Based on responses to epidemiologic surveys, the term chronic bronchitis was defined as a disease of the bronchi that manifested by cough and sputum expectoration occurring on most days for at least 3 months of the year and for at least 2 consecutive years when other pulmonary or cardiac causes for the chronic productive cough are excluded. [2] [3] [4] In 1958, a group of international experts participating in the Ciba Foundation Guest Symposium, proposed a definition of chronic bronchitis as \"a condition of subjects with chronic or recurrent excessive mucous secretion in the bronchial tree.\" 4 Because earlier studies suggested that chronic mucous hypersecretion did not cause airflow obstruction, evidence of airflow limitation was not incorporated into these earlier definitions. In 1986, chronic bronchitis and emphysema were acknowledged in an American Thoracic Society statement 5 as the two main components of COPD, which became a preferred term for both diagnoses. Evidence of expiratory flow limitation that did not change markedly over time was included in the definition of COPD.\r\n The recently published Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines, 6 sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, provides a definition of COPD that differs from previous consensus statements. It does not incorporate the terms chronic bronchitis and emphysema into the definition, as does the American Thoracic Society statement. Instead, it defines COPD as a disease state that is characterized by airflow obstruction that is no longer fully reversible and is usually progressive. The disease is caused by an interaction between noxious inhaled agents (eg, cigarette smoke, industrial pollutants, and other environmental pollutants) and host factors (eg, genetic factors and respiratory infections) that results in chronic inflammation in the walls and lumen of the airways. The pathology of COPD, as well as the symptoms, the pulmonary function abnormalities, and complications all can be explained on the basis of the underlying inflammation. While the GOLD document 6 does not specifically include chronic bronchitis and emphysema in the definition of COPD, it is clear that they are considered to be the predominant causes. For instance, GOLD defines the earliest stage of COPD, stage 0, by evidence of chronic cough and sputum expectoration in the absence of airflow obstruction on pulmonary function testing, not using the term chronic bronchitis. 6 Because chronic cough and sputum expectoration are common in all stages of COPD, the use of the traditional definition of chronic bronchitis as cough and sputum expectoration occurring on most days for at least 3 months of the year and for at least 2 consecutive years is most appropriate. Recommendations for this section of the review were obtained from data obtained using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms \"cough,\" \"chronic bronchitis,\" and \"COPD.\" Recommendations 1. Adults who have a history of chronic cough and sputum expectoration occurring on most days for at least 3 months and for at least 2 consecutive years should be given a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis when other respiratory or cardiac causes of chronic productive cough are ruled out. Level of evidence, low; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, B 2. The evaluation of patients with chronic cough should include a complete history regarding exposures to respiratory irritants including cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoke; passive smoke exposures; and hazardous environments in the home and workplace. All are predisposing factors of chronic bronchitis. Level of evidence, low; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, B\r\n Over the past decade there has been increasing interest in the pathogenesis and management of COPD as it has been recognized that the disease is having a major worldwide impact. 6 In the United States, estimates from national interviews taken by the National Center for Health Statistics, 7 have shown that \u03fe 16 million people are afflicted with COPD; about 14 million are thought to have chronic bronchitis, while 2 million have emphysema. 7 It has been suggested that these statistics underestimate the prevalence of COPD by as much as 50%, as many patients underreport their symptoms and their conditions remain undiagnosed. On the other hand, the accuracy of a self-reported diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and a physician-confirmed diagnosis of chronic bronchitis have been questioned. 8 Using a longitudinal population study, patients were surveyed for self-reported chronic bronchitis or physician-diagnosed chronic bronchitis. The survey asked about symptoms of chronic cough and sputum production and the timing of these symptoms. Seventeen percent of current smokers, 12.4% of former smokers, and 6% of never-smokers met the criteria for chronic bronchitis. The vast majority of people (88.4%) who reported a self-reported or physicianconfirmed diagnoses of chronic bronchitis did not meet the standard criteria. The overdiagnosis of chronic bronchitis by patients and physicians may be very common. Because the term bronchitis is often used as a common descriptor for a nonspecific and self-limited cough, many patients assume that they have had chronic bronchitis. In the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, using surveys, physical examinations, and pulmonary function testing, more accurate prevalence estimates have been made. Using World Health Organization definitions, it has been shown that 23.6 million adults (13.9% of the adult population) have COPD. 9, 10 Chronic bronchitis is among the most frequent causes of cough found in community surveys. 11 \r\n In developed countries, cigarette smoking is responsible for 85 to 90% of cases of chronic bronchitis and COPD. Cigarette smoke is composed of a complex mixture of \u03fe 400 particles and gases; the specific etiologic role of each of these constituents has not been established. Many studies 10, [12] [13] [14] have confirmed the association of cigarette smoking, chronic cough, and low lung function. The incidence of chronic bronchitis is directly proportional to the number of cigarettes smoked. Other risk factors for chronic mucus hypersecretion that have been identified are increasing age, male gender, childhood respiratory infections, frequent lower respiratory tract infections, occupational exposures, and asthma. Pipe and cigar smoking are also risk factors for both complications even in the absence of former cigarette smoking. 10 The prevalence of chronic cough in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was reported 15 in subjects without airflow obstruction and in those with undiagnosed airway obstruction. Cough was found in 9.3% of subjects and sputum production was found in 8.3% of subjects without airflow obstruction. The study also confirmed the observation that these symptoms are more common in subjects with more severe airflow obstruction. In those subjects with mild airflow obstruction, cough was found in 16.0% of those surveyed and sputum production in 17%. With severe airflow obstruction, using the GOLD staging criteria, the prevalence of cough increased to 49% of patients, and sputum production was found in 39.5% of patients.\r\n The identification of chronic cough and sputum production due to occupational exposures is not commonly made by clinicians; yet, it has been estimated that in as many as 15% of patients with chronic bronchitis and COPD, occupational exposure is the cause. 16 There are a number of epidemiologic associations of workplace hazards and chronic bronchitis. The diagnosis is usually made by finding a history of exposure in individuals who have no other identifiable cause of cough. This is often difficult because many workers are smokers or are exposed to second-hand smoke. Other workers, such as those exposed to organic dusts, may present with chronic cough and a history of asthma-like symptoms without airway eosinophilia, reversible airflow obstruction, or bronchial hyperresponsiveness. 17 This occurs with chronic exposure to cotton (byssinosis), jute, hemp, flax, sisal, wood, and various grains. There is a growing body of literature that has demonstrated that specific occupational exposures are associated with the symptoms of chronic bronchitis and, at times, airflow obstruction, 18 -21 which are comparable to moderate cigarette smoking. 22 The list of agents includes the following: coal; manufactured vitreous fibers; oil mist; cement; silica; silicates; osmium; vanadium; welding fumes; organic dusts; engine exhausts; fire smoke; and second-hand cigarette smoke. 23 While the prevalence of passive smoke exposure in the workplace has been decreasing as laws banning smoking in public places have been established, it is still a problem in many communities around the world. Often, nonsmokers are exposed to cigarette smoke in the home environment as well. Involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke is strongly associated with chronic cough and sputum production, even in young adults who have been screened for other risk factors. The risk increases significantly with an increasing duration of daily exposure. 24 Another important exposure in the home environment that increasingly has been recognized as a cause of chronic bronchitis and fixed airflow obstruction in underdeveloped countries is exposure to the fumes of cooking fuels, especially in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.\r\n Level of evidence, expert opinion; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, E\/A\r\n The inflammatory mechanisms of chronic bronchitis and COPD have been extensively reviewed. [25] [26] [27] [28] Structural changes of the airways have been described in otherwise healthy smokers even as young as 20 to 30 years old. BAL studies in such subjects have shown an increase in the number of neutrophils and macrophages; both play an important role in perpetuating the inflammatory process of chronic bronchitis. Bronchial biopsy specimens from former smokers show inflammatory changes that are similar to those in the active smoker, suggesting that inflammation may persist in the airway once established. A number of extracellular signaling proteins called cytokines are important in the pathogenesis of COPD because they are thought to mediate the tissue damage and repair that are induced by cigarette smoking. Increased quantities of certain proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u2423, and the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 have been found in the sputum of smokers with chronic bronchitis, and even further increased quantities of these cytokines have been found during acute exacerbations.\r\n Other structural changes in the airways of smokers include mucus gland hyperplasia, bronchiolar edema, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and peribronchiolar fibrosis. These changes result in a narrowing of the small airways (\u03fd 2 mm). There is a progressive worsening of pathologic changes when smokers with mild COPD and smokers with more severe disease are compared. 29 Neurogenic mechanisms may play an amplifying role in the pathogenesis of chronic bronchitis. 30 Sensory airway nerves contain tachykinins such as substance P, neurokinin A, and neurokinin B that are released in the airways in association with inflammation. These tachykinins have been found in the sputum of patients with chronic bronchitis and are known to augment airway secretions.\r\n The presence of a gel-like mucus in the airways of healthy people is essential for normal mucociliary clearance. The mucus is eliminated by the action of mucociliary clearance to the hypopharynx, where it is swallowed and rarely noticed. Normally, about 500 mL of sputum is produced each day, and it is usually not noticed. Smokers with chronic bronchitis produce larger amounts of sputum each day, as much as 100 mL\/d more than normal. This results in cough and sputum production. The excess mucus occurs as a result of an increase in the size and number of the submucosal glands and an increase in the number of goblet cells on the surface epithelium. Mucous gland enlargement and hyperplasia of the goblet cells are, therefore, the pathologic hallmark of chronic bronchitis. Goblet cells are normally absent in the small airways, and their presence there (often referred to as mucous metaplasia) is important to the development of COPD. In the larger airways in patients with chronic bronchitis, there is a reduction in the serous acini of the submucosal glands. This depresses local defenses to bacterial adherence, because these glands are known to produce microbial deterrents such as lactoferrin, antiproteases, and lysozyme. Other epithelial alterations that are seen in patients with chronic bronchitis are a decrease in the number and length of the cilia, and squamous metaplasia. The mucociliary abnormalities of chronic bronchitis cause the formation of a continuous sheet or blanket of mucus lining the airways instead of the discreet deposits of mucus seen in normal airways. The pooling of secretions also may occur. This provides an additional cause of bacterial growth, which in turn causes a release of toxins that are further damaging to the cilia and epithelial cells. Bacterial exoproducts are known to stimulate mucus production and slow ciliary beating, to impair immune effector cell function, and to destroy local Igs. This cycle is especially seen in current smokers, as opposed to former smokers.\r\n Based on these extensive observations regarding the pathogenesis of chronic bronchitis, it is recognized that the cause of cough in patients with chronic bronchitis is multifactorial. Airway inflammation and excessive bronchial secretions are likely to activate the afferent limb of the cough reflex. 31 There is evidence that the cough receptors are heightened in patients with chronic bronchitis as it has been demonstrated that capsaicin induced cough is increased. 32 When airflow obstruction is present, it often leads to an ineffective cough as a result of decreased expiratory flow, 33 and this coupled with impaired mucociliary clearance results in the further retention of secretions and a vicious cycle of chronic recurrent coughing. 34, 35 Even in the absence of airflow obstruction and with a short smoking history, impaired mucociliary clearance has been shown in young smokers. This occurs because of abnormal clearance in the small airways. Patients with advanced disease and evidence of airway obstruction have mucus retention in the small peripheral airways and larger central airways. 36, 37 This cycle is further worsened during episodes of acute viral and bacterial infections, which are common in patients with chronic bronchitis. 38 Airway Infection\/Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis\r\n Patients with chronic bronchitis have a greater frequency of acute respiratory infections than those without bronchitis, and with symptoms of an acute upper respiratory infection they are more likely to have signs of infection in the lower airways than are healthy control subjects. 39 During these attacks or exacerbations, cough and sputum production increase and the sputum may become purulent. The exacerbations may also cause worsening shortness of breath; therefore, clinicians should be aware that other conditions such as heart failure and pulmonary embolism could mimic an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. While there is no uniformly accepted definition of an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, most have acknowledged that this condition is due to a sudden deterioration in the condition of a stable patient with symptoms of increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, and\/or worsening of shortness of breath due to acute tracheobronchitis. An exacerbation is often preceded by symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. An important element of this definition is that causes of respiratory deterioration other than acute tracheobronchitis, such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, exacerbation of bronchiectasis, pneumothorax, and congestive heart failure, are excluded. Evidence of a viral infection is found in approximately one third of episodes. Common viral infections in the outpatient setting are rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza B, and parainfluenza. 40, 41 Viral respiratory infections predispose the airways to bacterial superinfection because they interfere with mucociliary clearance, impair bacterial killing by pulmonary macrophages, and increase the risk of aspirating secretions containing bacteria from the upper airways. Whether bacterial overgrowth or infection alone, in the absence of acute viral infection, is the cause of an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis has been controversial. During stable periods, many patients with chronic bronchitis, and especially current smokers, are colonized with bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae, and these same organisms have been found in patients during an acute exacerbation. However, the molecular typing of sputum isolates has shown that acute exacerbations of COPD are frequently associated with a new strain of a preexisting organism. This supports a causative role for bacteria in the acute exacerbations of COPD. 42 Although most such episodes of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis are self-limited, they are asso-ciated with substantial decrements in the quality of life 43 and impose a considerable financial burden on the health-care system. 43 Recommendation 4. Stable patients with chronic bronchitis who have a sudden deterioration of symptoms with increased cough, sputum production, sputum purulence, and\/or shortness of breath, which are often preceded by symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection, should be considered to have an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, as long as conditions other than acute tracheobronchitis are ruled out or are considered unlikely. Level of evidence, expert opinion; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, E\/A\r\n The role of chronic mucous hypersecretion and cough in the pathogenesis of airflow obstruction has been another area of controversy. The lack of association between chronic mucous hypersecretion and pulmonary function decline or mortality has been reported in a number of studies. 44 -47 Other studies have examined this question, and have shown an association between chronic mucous hypersecretion and overall mortality 48, 49 as well as mortality from COPD. 50, 51 The association between chronic mucous hypersecretion and the development of COPD also has been established. Both an excessive FEV 1 decline and an increased rate of hospitalization have been shown in patients with established COPD who have cough and excessive mucous production. It is likely that this is due to recurrent bronchial infections. 52, 53 Comorbid Illnesses It should always be kept in mind that when the character of the cough changes for prolonged periods in a patient with chronic bronchitis, the possibility of bronchogenic carcinoma or another complication should be considered. Prospective studies 54 of middle-aged cigarette smokers have shown that the incidence of lung cancer in this group is very high.\r\n While the most effective treatment of chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis is the avoidance of 108S respiratory irritants, often patients refuse to avoid them or find it impossible to do so because of conditions at home or in the workplace. The use of pharmacologic therapy at times may be helpful, but the evidence that these agents are effective often comes from clinical trials that do not evaluate cough as a primary outcome. The use of these agents in the treatment of stable patients with chronic disease and for episodes of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis will be reviewed. An American College of Chest Physicians\/American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine evidencebased report 55 on the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD is a useful guideline.\r\n The most effective means for controlling cough and sputum production in patients with chronic bronchitis is the avoidance of environmental irritants. During an acute exposure to respiratory irritants at home or in the workplace, patients may experience symptoms of increased cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath that are similar to those of an exacerbation due to infection. With respect to chronic cough, several nonrandomized trials have studied the effect of smoking cessation on this troubling symptom. Cough has been shown 56 to disappear or markedly decrease in 94 to 100% of patients after smoking cessation, and in approximately half of the subjects this occurred within 1 month. The Lung Health Study 57 investigated the effects of smoking cessation in smokers with mildto-moderate airflow obstruction. It was a 5-year randomized prospective trial 57 of intensive smoking intervention compared to a control group of smokers who received usual care. At the end of 5 years, 22% of those in the intervention group had stopped smoking for the entire study period. The beneficial effects, including a reduction of chronic cough and sputum production, occurred in the first year of smoking cessation. It was sustained throughout the entire study period. Ninety percent of those patients who had chronic cough at the beginning of the study and stopped smoking reported no cough by the end of the study. Similar findings were reported regarding sputum production. However, in patients with more severe degrees of airflow obstruction chronic cough is more likely to persist despite the avoidance of cigarettes or other respiratory irritants.\r\n In patients with chronic cough who have chronic exposure to respiratory irritants, such as personal tobacco use, passive smoke exposure, and workplace hazards, avoidance should always be recommended. It is the most effective means to improve or eliminate the cough of chronic bronchitis. Ninety percent of patients will have resolution of their cough after smoking cessation. Level of evidence, good; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A\r\n The use of antibiotics for treatment of an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis is recommended as it has been shown to shorten the course of the illness. The use of antibiotics is most effective in patients with purulent sputum and in those with a greater severity of illness that includes all three of the cardinal symptoms (ie, increased cough; increased sputum volume; and increased dyspnea 55, 58, 59 ) and in those with more severe airflow obstruction at baseline. 60 An opinion expressed by the US Food and Drug Administration 61 in November 2002 suggested that the randomized placebocontrolled trials of antibiotic therapy for the acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis that have been conducted over the past 40 years have been methodologically flawed and that a definitive decision regarding antibiotic use cannot be reached. However, based on a metaanalysis of nine studies, 58 which included randomized controlled trials, therapy with antibiotics is recommended, especially in those patients with more severe illness. The effect that antibiotics have on cough during an acute exacerbation of COPD has been investigated. There is no significant effect on cough clearance or cough frequency when compared to therapy with a placebo. 60 On the other hand, older trials 62 studying the usefulness of prophylactic therapy with antibiotics to reduce the frequency and\/or severity of attacks have shown a small but statistically significant effect in reducing the number of days of illness during an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. However, therapy with antibiotics is currently not recommended for stable patients with chronic bronchitis because of concerns about antibiotic resistance and the potential side effects of the drugs.\r\n there is no role for long-term prophylactic therapy with antibiotics. Level of evidence, low; benefit, none; grade of recommendation, I 7. In patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, the use of antibiotics is recommended; patients with severe exacerbations and those with more severe airflow obstruction at baseline are the most likely to benefit. Level of evidence, fair; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A\r\n The use of bronchopulmonary hygiene physical therapy for chronic bronchitis recently has been the subject of review. 63 The clinical benefits of postural drainage and chest percussion have not been proven, and their use in stable patients with chronic disease 63 or during an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis 55 cannot be recommended. \r\n The effects of therapy with short-acting inhaled \u2424-agonists in patients with chronic bronchitis have been extensively studied, 64 and have been shown to improve pulmonary function, breathlessness, and exercise tolerance. There is some evidence that chronic cough improves with the regular use of a short-acting inhaled \u2424-agonist, 65 but the results in the literature are not consistent. 66, 67 There is no significant improvement in sputum production with this therapy. 67, 68 The long-term effects of ipratropium bromide therapy have been evaluated in stable patients with chronic bronchitis. With this agent, patients coughed fewer times, and their cough was less severe. In addition, the volume of sputum expectorated decreased significantly. 69 On the other hand, trials 70 of a once-daily regimen of inhaled anticholinergic tiotropium in patients with COPD showed significant bronchodilatation and relief of dyspnea when compared to placebo, but no effect on cough using diaries to assess daily symptom scores.\r\n The use of oral theophylline for the treatment of COPD has declined over the last several decades because of concerns over side effects, especially in elderly patients, and issues regarding interactions with other drugs. Therapy with oral theophylline does improve cough in stable patients with chronic bronchitis. 71 During an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, there is good evidence that bronchodilator therapy improves outcomes 55 ; however, the effect on cough has not been systematically studied.\r\n 10a. In stable patients with chronic bronchitis, therapy with short-acting \u2424-agonists should be used to control bronchospasm and relieve dyspnea; in some patients, it may also reduce chronic cough. Level of evidence, good; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A 10b. In stable patients with chronic bronchitis, therapy with ipratropium bromide should be offered to improve cough. Level of evidence, fair; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A 10c. In stable patients with chronic bronchitis, treatment with theophylline should be considered to control chronic cough; careful monitoring for complications is necessary. Level of evidence, fair; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A 11. For patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, therapy with short-acting \u2424-agonists or anticholinergic bronchodilators should be administered during the acute exacerbation. If the patient does not show a prompt response, the other agent should be added after the first is administered at the maximal dose. Level of evidence, good; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A 12. For patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, theophylline should not be used for treatment. Level of evidence, good; net benefit, none; grade of recommendation, D\r\n There is limited evidence to justify the use of mucokinetic agents or inhaled corticosteroids to control cough in patients with chronic bronchitis. Combined therapy with a long-acting \u2424-agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid has been shown 72 to reduce the exacerbation rate in patients with COPD and also to reduce cough in long-term trials in patients 110S with COPD. Therapy with inhaled corticosteroids are recommended when airflow obstruction is severe or very severe (ie, FEV 1 \u03fd 50%) and when there is a history of frequent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. 73, 74 The beneficial effects of expectorants have not been proven for the treatment of cough in patients with chronic bronchitis. The oral mucolytic agent N-acetylcysteine has been studied 75 in stable patients with chronic bronchitis, and it has been shown to improve overall symptoms and to reduce the risk of exacerbations. It is not approved for use in the United States. The use of oral corticosteroids in patients has been discouraged. 6 There is no evidence of benefit in stable patients with chronic bronchitis, and the well-known side effects will preclude any long-term trials in the future.\r\n Therapy with mucokinetic agents is not useful during an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. 55 There is considerable evidence 55,76 that patients who have an exacerbation of COPD will benefit from systemic therapy with corticosteroids. Studies of the effect of therapy with corticosteroids on acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis have not specifically evaluated cough as an outcome. 73 Treatment failure and lung function (FEV 1 ) have been the most frequently assessed end points. In the largest trial, 73 there was equivalence between an 8-week trial and a 2-week trial of corticosteroids. Because of the significant potential for side effects with these agents, a 2-week trial is recommended. 73 Recommendations 13.

Based on responses to epidemiologic surveys, the term chronic bronchitis was defined as a disease of the bronchi that manifested by cough and sputum expectoration occurring on most days for at least 3 months of the year and for at least 2 consecutive years when other pulmonary or cardiac causes for the chronic productive cough are excluded. [ It does not incorporate the terms chronic bronchitis and emphysema into the definition, as does the American Thoracic Society statement. For instance, GOLD defines the earliest stage of COPD, stage 0, by evidence of chronic cough and sputum expectoration in the absence of airflow obstruction on pulmonary function testing, not using the term chronic bronchitis. Recommendations for this section of the review were obtained from data obtained using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. All are predisposing factors of chronic bronchitis. 6 In the United States, estimates from national interviews taken by the National Center for Health Statistics, 7 have shown that \u03fe 16 million people are afflicted with COPD; about 14 million are thought to have chronic bronchitis, while 2 million have emphysema. On the other hand, the accuracy of a self-reported diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and a physician-confirmed diagnosis of chronic bronchitis have been questioned. Seventeen percent of current smokers, 12.4% of former smokers, and 6% of never-smokers met the criteria for chronic bronchitis. Many studies 10, [12] [13] [14] have confirmed the association of cigarette smoking, chronic cough, and low lung function. The incidence of chronic bronchitis is directly proportional to the number of cigarettes smoked. With severe airflow obstruction, using the GOLD staging criteria, the prevalence of cough increased to 49% of patients, and sputum production was found in 39.5% of patients. The identification of chronic cough and sputum production due to occupational exposures is not commonly made by clinicians; yet, it has been estimated that in as many as 15% of patients with chronic bronchitis and COPD, occupational exposure is the cause. 16 There are a number of epidemiologic associations of workplace hazards and chronic bronchitis. 17 This occurs with chronic exposure to cotton (byssinosis), jute, hemp, flax, sisal, wood, and various grains. The risk increases significantly with an increasing duration of daily exposure. Bronchial biopsy specimens from former smokers show inflammatory changes that are similar to those in the active smoker, suggesting that inflammation may persist in the airway once established. A number of extracellular signaling proteins called cytokines are important in the pathogenesis of COPD because they are thought to mediate the tissue damage and repair that are induced by cigarette smoking. Increased quantities of certain proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u2423, and the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 have been found in the sputum of smokers with chronic bronchitis, and even further increased quantities of these cytokines have been found during acute exacerbations. Smokers with chronic bronchitis produce larger amounts of sputum each day, as much as 100 mL\/d more than normal. This results in cough and sputum production. Goblet cells are normally absent in the small airways, and their presence there (often referred to as mucous metaplasia) is important to the development of COPD. In the larger airways in patients with chronic bronchitis, there is a reduction in the serous acini of the submucosal glands. Other epithelial alterations that are seen in patients with chronic bronchitis are a decrease in the number and length of the cilia, and squamous metaplasia. The pooling of secretions also may occur. This cycle is especially seen in current smokers, as opposed to former smokers. This occurs because of abnormal clearance in the small airways. Evidence of a viral infection is found in approximately one third of episodes. Common viral infections in the outpatient setting are rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza B, and parainfluenza. 40, 41 Viral respiratory infections predispose the airways to bacterial superinfection because they interfere with mucociliary clearance, impair bacterial killing by pulmonary macrophages, and increase the risk of aspirating secretions containing bacteria from the upper airways. Level of evidence, expert opinion; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, E\/A\r\n The role of chronic mucous hypersecretion and cough in the pathogenesis of airflow obstruction has been another area of controversy. 44 -47 Other studies have examined this question, and have shown an association between chronic mucous hypersecretion and overall mortality 48, 49 as well as mortality from COPD. An American College of Chest Physicians\/American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine evidencebased report 55 on the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD is a useful guideline. The most effective means for controlling cough and sputum production in patients with chronic bronchitis is the avoidance of environmental irritants. During an acute exposure to respiratory irritants at home or in the workplace, patients may experience symptoms of increased cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath that are similar to those of an exacerbation due to infection. At the end of 5 years, 22% of those in the intervention group had stopped smoking for the entire study period. It was sustained throughout the entire study period. Similar findings were reported regarding sputum production. In patients with chronic cough who have chronic exposure to respiratory irritants, such as personal tobacco use, passive smoke exposure, and workplace hazards, avoidance should always be recommended. It is the most effective means to improve or eliminate the cough of chronic bronchitis. Ninety percent of patients will have resolution of their cough after smoking cessation. there is no role for long-term prophylactic therapy with antibiotics. In patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, the use of antibiotics is recommended; patients with severe exacerbations and those with more severe airflow obstruction at baseline are the most likely to benefit. Therapy with oral theophylline does improve cough in stable patients with chronic bronchitis. 71 During an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, there is good evidence that bronchodilator therapy improves outcomes 55 ; however, the effect on cough has not been systematically studied. In stable patients with chronic bronchitis, therapy with short-acting \u2424-agonists should be used to control bronchospasm and relieve dyspnea; in some patients, it may also reduce chronic cough. If the patient does not show a prompt response, the other agent should be added after the first is administered at the maximal dose.

The oral mucolytic agent N-acetylcysteine has been studied 75 in stable patients with chronic bronchitis, and it has been shown to improve overall symptoms and to reduce the risk of exacerbations.

Design: Prospective follow-up cohort study. Setting: University-affiliated hospital. Patients: Ninety-four patients who recovered from SARS were assessed at a uniform time point of 1 year after hospital discharge.\r\n The study included the measurement of static and dynamic lung volumes, the determination of the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and a health status evaluation using the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Results: Eleven patients (12%) had mild impairment of FVC, 20 (21%) had mild impairment of FEV 1 , 5 (5%) had mild impairment of the FEV 1 \/FVC ratio, and 17 (18%) had mild impairment of the DLCO. There was one patient (1%) who had moderate impairment of FVC, one patient (1%) who had moderate impairment of the FEV 1 \/FVC ratio, and three patients (3%) who had moderate impairment of the DLCO. No pulmonary function abnormalities were detected in 59 patients (63%).

Although it has been \u03fe 1 year since the illness was successfully contained, published data on the condition of those who survived the illness are limited. Several studies [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] have reported persistent symptoms, as well as radiologic and functional abnormalities during follow-up several weeks or months after hospital discharge, but the prevalence and severity of the longterm sequelae of SARS remain largely unknown. Because lung function is known to improve for up to 1 year after discharge from the hospital in survivors of other causes of acute lung injury, 10, 11 it is imperative that long-term studies of SARS survivors be conducted in order to determine the persistence of abnormalities in pulmonary function, and whether these abnormalities contribute to permanent impairment and disability. As the majority of patients with SARS survive the illness 2 and medical personnel, physicians, nurses, and hospital workers are among those commonly infected in most countries, 2 an additional requisite for the identification and quantification of morbidity among survivors may be for the consideration of awarding compensation.\r\n The purpose of this study was to characterize the long-term pulmonary function and health status in a prospectively identified cohort of patients who survived SARS in Singapore.\r\n There were 206 cases of SARS in Singapore reported to the World Health Organization as of June 26, 2003. 12 According to the World Health Organization case definition, probable SARS was diagnosed in all of these patients, 13 and they were admitted to a single hospital (Tan Tock Seng Hospital). Survivors at 1 year after hospital discharge were eligible for enrollment in the study if they were \u0546 21 years of age. Patients were excluded from the study if they had been immobile before being admitted to hospital for SARS, had a history of pulmonary resection, or had a documented neurologic or psychiatric disease. We obtained written informed consent from patients prior to pulmonary function testing. This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee.\r\n One hundred seventy-four consecutive SARS survivors were evaluated for this study (Fig 1) . Twenty-seven patients were excluded from the study for the reasons outlined in Figure 1 . Seventeen patients were uncontactable, and 7 were overseas during the study period. Of the remaining 123 patients, 29 declined to participate in this study. The diagnosis of SARS was confirmed by a positive serology result for SARS-CoV in all except 1 of the 94 patients enrolled in this study.\r\n Pulmonary function tests at 1 year after hospital discharge included spirometry, and measurements of total lung capacity and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco). The protocol and equipment used for pulmonary function testing in this study were similar to those used in an earlier study 9 that we conducted among recovered SARS patients. Spirometry was performed in accordance with recommended standards. 14 All of the lung function tests were performed with the subjects seated and on the same day, but after patients had answered the health status questionnaire. FVC and FEV 1 were measured with a clinical spirometer (V max 229; SensorMedics; Yorba Linda, CA). Total lung capacity and its subdivisions were measured by the nitrogen washout method with the spirometer, the testing ad-hered to standard criteria. 15 The Dlco was determined by the single-breath carbon monoxide technique 16 using an infrared analyzer (V max 229). Dlco was adjusted for a hemoglobin concentration of 14.6 g\/dL for men and 13.4 g\/dL for women. 16 The spirometry, lung volumes, and Dlco measurements were expressed as the percentages of predicted normal values using reference values taken from the prediction equations of Chia et al 17 and Poh and Chia. 18 The rating of impairment was made according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) statement 19 for the evaluation of impairment\/disability secondary to respiratory disorders.\r\n All of the eligible patients completed the Singapore-English version of the St. George respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ). The SGRQ is a standardized, self-administered, pulmonary-specific health status questionnaire containing 50 items and 76 weighted responses that is divided into three subscales, as follows: (1) symptoms (8 items); (2) activity (16 items); and (3) impacts (26 items). SGRQ scores were calculated using score calculation algorithms and missing data imputation recommended by its developer. For each subscale and for the overall questionnaire, scores range from 0 (no impairment) to 100 (maximum impairment). Mean scores obtained from a sample of persons (n \u03ed 74) between 17 and 80 years of age (mean age, 46 years) who had no history of respiratory disease (mean FEV 1 , 95%) served as reference values (P.W. Jones, MD; Scoring Manual of the SGRQ May 2003).\r\n Comparisons between groups were done with the Student t test for normally distributed continuous variables and with Mann-Whitney U tests for nonnormally distributed continuous variables. The linear regression model was used to study the association between known prognostic indicators of SARS and the 1-year pulmonary function outcomes, as well as the association between mechanical ventilation parameters during the acute illness and 1-year pulmonary function outcomes. Results were reported as the mean \u03ee SD. The conventional level of statistical significance of 0.05 was used for all of the analyses.\r\n The baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients during their hospital admission for SARS are shown in Table 1 . Forty-seven of the 94 patients (50%) were health-care workers. The mean (\u03ee SD) of the percentage of lung involvement based on the worst chest radiograph appearance during the acute illness using a scoring system similar to that of Wong et al 20 was 40.6 \u03ee 29.9%. Eleven patients (12%) required admission to the ICU, and the mean Pao 2 \/ fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio 2 ) ratio among these patients in the ICU was 95.5 \u03ee 65.6. Seven of these patients required mechanical ventilation. All seven of the patients had a Pao 2 \/Fio 2 ratio of \u0545 200 while receiving mechanical ventilation with a positive endexpiratory pressure of \u0546 5 cm H 2 O and evidence of airspace changes in all four of the quadrants on chest radiography. Overall, seven patients (7%) had a history of cigarette smoking. Nineteen patients (20%) had significant preexisting medical conditions. The four most common preexisting illnesses were hypertension (six patients), bronchial asthma (five patients), treated pulmonary tuberculosis (three patients), and diabetes mellitus (two patients).\r\n Comparing the SARS survivors who were enrolled in this study with those who were not included, there was no significant difference with regard to age, gender, steroid exposure, or severity of the acute illness as indicated by the length of hospitalization, the requirement for intensive care or mechanical ventilation, and the highest recorded serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (Table 2 ). Of the seven enrolled patients who had required mechanical ventilation, the mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 15 days compared with 11 days for the five patients who required mechanical ventilation among the 80 survivors who were not included in this study. The difference in the mean duration of mechanical ventilation between these two subsets of patients was not statistically significant (p \u03ed 0.443).\r\n At 1 year after hospital discharge, with regard to respiratory symptoms that were present at least a few days a month over the preceding year, 28 patients (30%) had cough, 19 (20%) had increased sputum production, 28 (30%) had shortness of breath, and 7 (7%) had occasional wheezing. The mean body mass index of the group at this time was 23.4 \u03ee 4.5.\r\n The pulmonary function test results of the 94 patients are shown in Table 3 . The group means of forced expiratory volumes, static lung volumes, and diffusion capacity were all within normal limits (ie, \u03fe 80% predicted). However, several cases of abnormalities in FVC, FEV 1 , FEV 1 \/FVC ratio, and Dlco were detected. According to the ATS recommendations 19 for evaluating respiratory impairment, 11 patients (12%) had mild impairment of FVC, 20 (21%) had mild impairment of FEV 1 , 5 (5%) had mild impairment of FEV 1 \/FVC ratio, and 17 (18%) had mild impairment of Dlco. There was one patient (1%) with moderate impairment of FVC, one patient (1%) with moderate impairment of FEV 1 \/ FVC ratio, and three patients (3%) with moderate impairment of Dlco. Because there were cases of patients with impairment in more than one of the four variables, the number of patients with mild and moderate impairment according to the ATS recommendations was 30 (32%) and 5 (5%), respectively. Table 4 shows the pulmonary function data of these 35 patients who had respiratory impairment. The majority of the impairment in FEV 1 and FVC suggests a restrictive abnormality, but in only eight patients was the total lung capacity (TLC) \u03fd 80% predicted. Two patients had obstructive abnormality with an FEV 1 \/FVC ratio \u03fd 70% predicted, and one of them (patient No. 17 in Table 4 ) had a history of poorly controlled bronchial asthma. The other patient (patient No. 12 in Table 4 ) had a significant history of cigarette smoking. None of the other patients who had respiratory impairment were current or ex-smokers. The preexisting medical conditions that may affect pulmonary function in the patients with pulmonary function abnormalities are as shown in Table 4 . Table 5 shows the serial pulmonary function data of 17 patients in the present study who were detected to have abnormalities from among a group of patients who had been evaluated at 3 months after hospital discharge in an earlier study. 9 The mean Dlco improved significantly by 8.3% (p \u03ed 0.047) at 1 year, but no significant changes were detected in the other pulmonary function variables of these 17 patients.\r\n Comparing the pulmonary function of patients who required ICU care and mechanical ventilation during hospitalization for SARS with those who did not, there was no significant difference in FVC, FEV 1 , FEV 1 \/FVC ratio, or Dlco between the two groups. Using multivariate analysis to analyze the association between known prognostic indicators of SARS, 2 namely, age, gender, comorbidity, serum LDH level, ribavarin level, and steroid use, and the 1-year pulmonary function outcomes, we found that only age was significantly associated with the FVC percent predicted (every year increase, \u03ea0.34; 95% confidence interval, \u03ea0.6 to \u03ea0.08; p \u03ed 0.01) and with the FEV 1 percent predicted (every year increase, \u03ea0.26; 95% confidence interval, \u03ea0.5 to \u03ea0.01; p \u03ed 0.04), but none of the prognostic factors were significantly associated with the Dlco percent predicted. Among patients who required intensive care and mechanical ventilation during the acute illness, there was no significant association among the duration of mechanical ventilation, the Pao 2 \/ Fio 2 ratio on admission to the ICU, steroid usage, and the pulmonary function parameters at 1 year after hospital discharge. All 94 of the patients completed the SGRQ. Domain scores other than the symptoms domain of the SGRQ were significantly higher (ie, worse) than the population norms (Table 6 ).\r\n Impaired pulmonary function is present in about one third of patients 1 year after their recovery from SARS. The most common pulmonary function impairment was of the FEV 1 and Dlco. As measured by the SGRQ, SARS survivors had significant worsening in health status compared with the healthy population.\r\n To date, reported studies on the functional outcomes of patients during the recovery stage of SARS are limited, [3] [4] [5] [6] 9 and none has evaluated the outcomes at a uniform 1-year time point. In assessing long-term outcomes after acute lung injury, it is important to attempt the consecutive enrollment of survivors with defined time points for study, because there is a possibility of bias toward the selection of sicker patients with abnormal pulmonary function test results if studies enrolled any patient who returned for a follow-up evaluation. In an earlier prospective study 9 of pulmonary function tests in 46 recovered SARS patients at a uniform time point of 3 months after hospital discharge, we found 7 patients (15%) with mild impairment of FVC, 12 patients (26%) with mild impairment of FEV 1 , 17 patients (37%) with mild impairment of Dlco, and 1 patient (2%) with moderate impairment of Dlco. Overall, pulmonary function defects were detected in half of the recovered SARS patients at 3 months after hospital discharge. The finding in the present study of persistent pulmonary function abnormalities in a significant proportion of SARS patients 1 year after hospital discharge is notable, not only for the long-term follow-up and management of these patients but also as a highlight of the permanent respiratory impairment that can result from the acute infection. Viral pneumonia usually resolves without any clinical or radiologic sequelae, whereas SARS-related radiologic sequelae appear to be quite common among survivors, as observed by several studies. 8, 21 The finding of higher prevalence of dynamic lung volume abnormalities than Dlco impairment in the present study, together with the significant improvement in Dlco but not dynamic lung volumes in serial lung function testing of a subset of our patients, suggest that Dlco abnormalities can improve with time. In contrast, ventilatory abnormalities are more likely to persist in the long term. This appears to be in contrast to information from several reviews 22,23 on survivors of the ARDS documenting the persistence of a mild reduction in Dlco as the most common abnormality found in pulmonary function testing, and that Dlco remained low in long-term follow-ups. Interestingly, all of the articles on ARDS survivors reporting normal lung volumes or very low rates of either obstruction or restriction were published earlier when cohorts were likely more heterogeneous, and lung injuries in the surviving population were most likely less severe. 24 -26 In more recent studies, the proportion of patients with ventilatory impairment has ranged constantly higher, from 18 to 33% for airway obstruction and from 15 to 45% for lung restriction. [27] [28] [29] [30] In particular, Neff et al 31 have reported that residual restrictive and obstructive types of functional impairment remained common (25% of patients with each type) in survivors of severe ARDS, and only 12.5% of patients had impairment in Dlco.\r\n The exact pathologic cause(s) of the pulmonary dysfunction in recovered SARS patients is not known. Adverse long-term pulmonary sequelae of the ARDS include lung fibrosis, but untreated bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia and bronchiolitis obliterans may also contribute to the physical morbidity in ARDS survivors. 32 In addition, neuromuscular weakness may also contribute to the decline in pulmonary function. 33 A recent study 8 correlating high-resolution CT scan findings and pulmonary function in survivors of SARS during the early recovery phase (ie, 25 to 38 days after hospital discharge) found that FEV 1 , FVC, TLC, residual volume, and Dlco correlated well with the severity of ground-glass opacification and fibrosis. The presence of fibrosis was associated with significantly lower pulmonary function variables. It would be interesting to compare structural and functional changes in survivors of SARS during late recovery to see whether a similar correlation persists and whether these changes are different from those observed in ARDS survivors whose condition is not related to SARS.\r\n In contrast to the results of the earlier study 5 among patients averaging 28 days in the posthospital discharge period, significantly worse scores were not found in the symptoms domain of the SGRQ among our SARS survivors at 1 year. This is likely attributable to an improvement in symptoms with time of recovery. In studies among survivors of ARDS, it is known that nearly all of the patients are symptomatic at hospital discharge, but there is significant improvement over the first year after ARDS in most patients. 11 In addition, survivors of ARDS are also much less symptomatic than other patients with chronic lung disease. 11 Nonetheless, the mean activity score of our patients measuring disturbances to their daily physical activity and their mean impacts score covering a wide range of disturbances of psychosocial function remain significantly worse compared with those in healthy subjects. Physical morbidity in SARS survivors may also stem from extrapulmonary causes. In an earlier study 9 evaluating pulmonary function and exercise capacity among patients from the same cohort, we found no evidence of exercise limitation solely because of ventilatory constraints, and there were very few patients with significant oxygen desaturation during exercise. Hence, the disability represented by an increased (ie, worse) score on the SGRQ activity domain in the present study is not likely to be specific to intrinsic pulmonary dysfunction, especially given that pulmonary dysfunction in our patients is modest, but may instead reflect any cause of impaired physical functioning, such as muscle loss\/weakness or neuromus- There are several limitations of this study that we would like to acknowledge. First, the heterogeneity of acute lung disease encompassed by the case definition of SARS may account for the observed variation in pulmonary and extrapulmonary sequelae among our patients. Second, the proportion of patients who declined evaluation may have led to a bias toward the selection of sicker patients with abnormal pulmonary function. This is likely, because most of the patients who declined participation in the study offered a lack of symptoms and inconvenience as the main reasons for doing so. Third, evaluations of arterial blood gas levels and exercise testing were not performed in this study. However, we did not anticipate that there was significant hypoxemia in these patients, because none of them was found to have hypoxemia or was assessed as requiring oxygen supplementation during routine follow-up. Cardiopulmonary responses to exercise in SARS survivors had been evaluated in an earlier study 9 at 3 months after hospital discharge, but we do not have any longer term data on this. Fourth, only a respiratory-specific measure of health status was used in this study. A generic health status measure, such as the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form health survey, would have provided a more global assessment of the patients, especially with regard to their role limitations as a result of emotional problems, mental health, bodily pain, and general health perceptions. The interaction of the data obtained from generic and disease-specific measures of health status may also have helped to determine the contributions of pulmonary and nonpulmonary factors to the longterm health status of SARS survivors.\r\n In summary, 1 year after recovery from SARS, persistent pulmonary function impairment was found in about one third of patients. The health status of SARS survivors was also significantly worse compared with that of the healthy population.","sha":"9c92a314b37582d54b11a7dfa978d96575b614c5","publish_time":"2005-09-30","authors":"Ong, Kian-Chung; Ng, Alan Wei-Keong; Lee, Lawrence Soon-U; Kaw, Gregory; Kwek, Seow-Khee; Leow, Melvin Khee-Shing; Earnest, Arul","journal":"Chest","doi":"10.1378\/chest.128.3.1393","Title":"Chest","H index":267.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"T he severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently described condition caused by infection with a coronavirus (CoV) 1 and is characterized by both an atypical pneumonia and efficient nosocomial transmission. Because lung function is known to improve for up to 1 year after discharge from the hospital in survivors of other causes of acute lung injury, 10, 11 it is imperative that long-term studies of SARS survivors be conducted in order to determine the persistence of abnormalities in pulmonary function, and whether these abnormalities contribute to permanent impairment and disability. As the majority of patients with SARS survive the illness 2 and medical personnel, physicians, nurses, and hospital workers are among those commonly infected in most countries, 2 an additional requisite for the identification and quantification of morbidity among survivors may be for the consideration of awarding compensation. Survivors at 1 year after hospital discharge were eligible for enrollment in the study if they were \u0546 21 years of age. We obtained written informed consent from patients prior to pulmonary function testing. Twenty-seven patients were excluded from the study for the reasons outlined in Figure 1 . Spirometry was performed in accordance with recommended standards. FVC and FEV 1 were measured with a clinical spirometer (V max 229; SensorMedics; Yorba Linda, CA). 15 The Dlco was determined by the single-breath carbon monoxide technique 16 using an infrared analyzer (V max 229). Dlco was adjusted for a hemoglobin concentration of 14.6 g\/dL for men and 13.4 g\/dL for women. 18 The rating of impairment was made according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) statement 19 for the evaluation of impairment\/disability secondary to respiratory disorders. Comparisons between groups were done with the Student t test for normally distributed continuous variables and with Mann-Whitney U tests for nonnormally distributed continuous variables. The baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients during their hospital admission for SARS are shown in Table 1 . Forty-seven of the 94 patients (50%) were health-care workers. Overall, seven patients (7%) had a history of cigarette smoking. Comparing the SARS survivors who were enrolled in this study with those who were not included, there was no significant difference with regard to age, gender, steroid exposure, or severity of the acute illness as indicated by the length of hospitalization, the requirement for intensive care or mechanical ventilation, and the highest recorded serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (Table 2 ). According to the ATS recommendations 19 for evaluating respiratory impairment, 11 patients (12%) had mild impairment of FVC, 20 (21%) had mild impairment of FEV 1 , 5 (5%) had mild impairment of FEV 1 \/FVC ratio, and 17 (18%) had mild impairment of Dlco. Table 4 shows the pulmonary function data of these 35 patients who had respiratory impairment. The majority of the impairment in FEV 1 and FVC suggests a restrictive abnormality, but in only eight patients was the total lung capacity (TLC) \u03fd 80% predicted. 17 in Table 4 ) had a history of poorly controlled bronchial asthma. Table 5 shows the serial pulmonary function data of 17 patients in the present study who were detected to have abnormalities from among a group of patients who had been evaluated at 3 months after hospital discharge in an earlier study. All 94 of the patients completed the SGRQ. Impaired pulmonary function is present in about one third of patients 1 year after their recovery from SARS. The most common pulmonary function impairment was of the FEV 1 and Dlco. This appears to be in contrast to information from several reviews 22,23 on survivors of the ARDS documenting the persistence of a mild reduction in Dlco as the most common abnormality found in pulmonary function testing, and that Dlco remained low in long-term follow-ups. The presence of fibrosis was associated with significantly lower pulmonary function variables. Third, evaluations of arterial blood gas levels and exercise testing were not performed in this study.

Despite recent progress in identifying and analyzing the coronavirus that is responsible for it, few reports have addressed the clinical complications of SARS. The present study was a two-center retrospective cohort study. All patients in the study had SARS, were managed in the two major Hong Kong hospitals (ie, Prince of Wales Hospital and United Christian Hospital), and had developed spontaneous pneumothorax during their hospitalization between March 10, 2003, and April 28, 2003. Spontaneous pneumothorax was reported in 6 of 356 SARS patients who were treated at the two hospitals during the period. This represents an incidence of 1.7%. None of the six patients had a history of smoking or pulmonary disease. The rate of admission to the ICU was 66.7% and the crude mortality rate was 33.3% in this group of patients. There was a trend for the mean neutrophil count in these patients to be higher than in previously reported cohorts of comparable SARS patients (14.5 \u060b 10 9 vs 4.6 \u060b 10 9 neutrophils per liter, respectively). Conservative measures like tube thoracostomy or observation alone offered satisfactory initial symptomatic management in five of six patients. Spontaneous pneumothorax is a specific and potentially life-threatening complication in SARS patients. Patients with extensive lung injury, as indicated by severe clinical courses, and in particular high neutrophil counts, appear to be most at risk. The benefits of surgical management must be balanced against the potential risks to health-care workers.

In the space of months, a considerable\r\n body of information has been generated regarding this virus, in particular regarding its genome and molecular biology. 4 -6 Although definitive algorithms for its diagnosis and management are now beginning to emerge, [7] [8] [9] there have been few reports on its complications. SARS appears primarily to cause severe respiratory distress from diffuse pulmonary inflammation. 10 Additional pulmonary complications such as pneumothorax, with its impact on the already compromised lung function, are therefore of great concern to the patients and their clinicians.\r\n The Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) in Hong Kong, a university teaching hospital with nearly 1,500 beds, was the first epicenter of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, one of the areas in the world most heavily hit with the disease. 8 Between March 10, 2003 , and April 28, 2003, a total of 214 SARS patients were treated at PWH. The United Christian Hospital (UCH) is a major district general hospital with 1,265 beds, and it received 142 SARS patients during the same period. Most of the SARS admissions to UCH represented cases from the Amoy Gardens housing complex, which was the site of the largest community-based outbreak in Hong Kong, accounting for \u03fe 300 cases. 8 In this study, we report our combined experience in managing six SARS patients who developed spontaneous pneumothorax during their hospitalization at these two institutions.\r\n All patients in whom SARS was diagnosed according to the World Health Organization case definition 11 at either PWH or UCH during the period from March 10, 2003 , to April 28, 2003 , and who experienced a spontaneous pneumothorax to one or both pleural spaces during their hospitalization were eligible for inclusion in the study. The World Health Organization case definition is as follows: history of high fever (ie, temperature, \u03fe 38\u00b0C); one or more respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing; and close contact within 10 days before the onset of symptoms with a person in whom SARS was diagnosed, history of travel within 10 days before the onset of symptoms to an area with reported foci of SARS transmission, or both. 11 Patients whose pneumothorax could be attributed to a preexisting pulmonary disease or to an iatrogenic cause (eg, barotrauma or invasive procedures to the chest or neck) were excluded from the study. At PWH, we were aware of four patients who developed pneumothorax secondary to mechanical ventilation (two patients) or central venous cannulation (two patients). As the causes of pneumothorax in these cases were clearly iatrogenic and not spontaneous, these patients were not included in our series.\r\n Six patients met the inclusion criteria for our study. Patients in cases 1 to 3 were admitted to PWH. Patients in cases 4 to 6 were all residents of Amoy Gardens and were admitted to UCH. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data for these patients are summarized in Table 1 .\r\n The medical treatment protocol for SARS patients at both of our institutes is the same and has been previously reported. [7] [8] [9] All patients in this study received therapy with IV ribavirin (Rebetol; Schering-Plough; Kenilworth, NJ) and steroids (typically, methylprednisolone) according to this protocol.\r\n A 47-year-old man who was a nonsmoker with no significant medical history presented with a 2-day history of acute onset of fever, chills, and severe myalgia. He was a radiographer at PWH who had been in close contact with SARS patients for the 3 weeks since the initial outbreak. His chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates at the time of hospital admission. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, ribavirin, methylprednisolone, and convalescent serum was given with initial clinical improvement. On the 32nd day after hospital admission, he was noted to have a sudden increase in dyspnea. Chest radiography confirmed a left pneumothorax with parts of the left lung adherent to the parietal pleura as a result of postinflammatory adhesions (Fig 1) , creating several loculations of air and fluid within the left pleural space. The pneumothorax was managed with a chest tube. However, despite suction of 10 cm H 2 O from the chest drain, the chest radiograph showed that the left lung had only partially reexpanded, with several large loculations of air still remaining. A CT scan of the thorax confirmed the presence of loculated air pockets, which were not adequately drained, and showed diffuse, patchy inflammatory changes in both lungs, with a \"honeycomb\" appearance that was similar to that of mild bronchiectasis (Fig 2) . A pigtail catheter was inserted into the largest loculation under ultrasound guidance. The pigtail catheter then was replaced with another chest tube for better drainage, and both drains were set to suction at 10 cm H 2 O. Symptomatic relief of the dyspnea was achieved, with improved lung reexpansion seen on chest radiography. An air leak persisted from both drains but eventually resolved with conservative management after 21 days, after which both the drains were successfully removed.\r\n A frail 82-year-old woman presented with a fever (ie, temperature, 38\u00b0C), chills, dizziness, and rhinorrhea. She was a nonsmoker with a history of hypertension but no pulmonary disease. Her son, a health-care worker with prior contact with SARS patients, had recently received a diagnosis of SARS but had been living with this patient for over a week prior to his own hospital admission. Her chest radiograph on presentation showed mild bilateral focal haziness, and a CT scan of the thorax revealed consolidations in the upper and lower lobes of her right lung. She initially showed a good response to treatment with ribavirin and methylprednisolone, with settling of her fever, but on the 37th day after hospital admission, she had an acute increase in dyspnea. A chest radiograph confirmed a 20% right-sided pneumothorax. Despite her dyspnea, she remained fully conscious and was able to communicate verbally. Immediate chest drainage was offered to the patient, but she strongly refused. In view of the patient's wishes and the family's acceptance of her poor prognosis, it was agreed that invasive management of the pneumothorax would be withheld. Serial chest radiographs showed no further increase in the size of the pneumothorax. The patient gradually developed multiple organ failure from the SARS and died 4 days after the occurrence of the pneumothorax.\r\n A 47-year-old man who was a nonsmoker with no previous pulmonary history presented with a 5-day history of acute fever (ie, temperature, \u03fe 38\u00b0C) and dry cough. His initial chest radiograph showed right upper lobe consolidation only, but the radiographic changes progressed rapidly, with the development of pulmonary infiltrates in both lower zones after only 2 days. The clinical condition correspondingly worsened, and the patient required transfer to the ICU 4 days after the initial hospital admission, although he did not require mechanical ventilatory support. On the 14th day after hospital admission, his shortness of breath acutely worsened, and the chest radiograph demonstrated a 20% spontaneous right pneumothorax (Fig 3) . Chest tube insertion was performed, with rapid improvement in his dyspnea. Even without suction applied to the chest drain, full reexpansion of the lung was demonstrated on chest radiography. However, an air leak persisted after chest tube insertion and took 14 days to resolve spontaneously without further intervention.\r\n A previously healthy 32-year-old woman who was a nonsmoker presented with a 1-day history of acute onset of fever, myalgia, and mild nonproductive cough. Her chest radiograph on presentation showed right lower zone consolidation. After initial improvement in response to treatment with ribavirin and steroids, she showed progressive clinical deterioration from day 15 onward. A high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the thorax showed widespread ground-glass opacifications in both lungs. On the 25th day after hospital admission, she developed sudden respiratory distress requiring urgent transfer to the ICU. The chest radiograph taken immediately confirmed a 50% left pneumothorax and a very small right apical pneumothorax. A left chest tube was inserted immediately with good symptomatic relief of her dyspnea. Suction at 10 cm H 2 O was applied, and subsequent chest radiographs showed complete reexpansion of the left lung and spontaneous resolution of the tiny right apical pneumothorax. She suddenly became more dyspneic again on the 31st day, and a chest radiograph showed a 50% right pneumothorax had recurred. A right chest drain was inserted, and 10 cm H 2 O of suction was applied. Although the chest radiograph showed good reexpansion of the right lung, she developed progressively severe respiratory failure with ground-glass lung infiltrations seen on her subsequent chest radiographs. She was intubated 2 days later and received mechanical ventilation. This appeared to exacerbate the air leakage from the right lung, with chest radiography showing a recurrent right pneumothorax. A second right chest drain was inserted, and both were set on suction of 20 cm H 2 O. Chest radiography confirmed complete right lung reexpansion, but her lung infiltrates progressed and she developed refractory hypoxemia. She died with intractable respiratory failure 4 weeks after ICU admission.\r\n A 48-year-old man presented with a 1-day history of acute onset of fever (temperature, 39\u00b0C) and chills. He had neither smoked nor experienced any significant medical illness. His chest radiograph on hospital admission showed mild right lower zone infiltration. Therapy with ribavirin and steroid yielded a good initial clinical response, but he deteriorated in the second week with a recurrence of high fever, increasing dyspnea, and diffuse bilateral patchy infiltrates seen on chest radiographs. On the 17th day after hospital admission, increased dyspnea and mild subcutaneous emphysema in the neck were noted, and the chest radiograph (Fig 4) showed a pneumomediastinum and thin rims (\u03fd 1 cm) of pneumothoraces bilaterally. He was transferred to the ICU, and a right chest drain was inserted. However, his dyspnea persisted, and he promptly required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilatory support. A left chest drain insertion was subsequently performed, and 10 cm H 2 O suction was applied to both chest drains. A chest radiograph showed the full expansion of both lungs. However, after a few days of positive-pressure mechanical ventilation, increasing subcutaneous emphysema was noted, which is indicative of persistent air leakage. Therefore, one additional chest drain was inserted on each side. The air leaks gradually resolved after 1 month, and all chest drains were removed immediately prior to his weaning from mechanical ventilation.\r\n A 32-year-old man who was a nonsmoker presented with a 2-day history of fever (temperature, up to 40\u00b0C), chills, rigors, and myalgia. The findings of his chest radiograph taken on hospital admission were unremarkable, but the HRCT scan of his thorax demonstrated consolidation in the medial basal segment of the left lower lobe, which is consistent with SARS. Therapy with ribavirin and methylprednisolone was administered, with a good initial clinical response. However, his fever recurred on day 5, followed by both clinical and radiologic deterioration. Seventeen days after hospital admission, his condition acutely deteriorated further with worsening dyspnea. Chest radiography showed bilateral lower zone ground-glass infiltrates with patchy consolidations. His HRCT scan demonstrated extensive ground-glass opacities and consolidation, plus an extensive pneumomediastinum with air tracking up to the roots of the neck, creating subcutaneous emphysema. This was managed conservatively, but on the 21st day after hospital admission, he experienced oxygen desaturation to an arterial oxygen saturation of 70%, despite receiving maximal oxygen therapy via a rebreathing mask. He was transferred to the ICU, where a chest radiograph confirmed small (ie, \u03fd 10%) bilateral apical pneumothoraces. He was able to maintain borderline oxygenation while receiving maximal oxygen therapy. Chest drain insertion and mechanical ventilation were refused by the patient. Serial chest radiographs showed a gradual reduction in the size of the pneumothoraces. An HRCT scan performed on day 31 after hospital admission showed only a small residual pneumothorax on the right side and a slowly resolving pneumomediastinum. On day 41, an HRCT scan demonstrated complete resolution of the pneumothoraces on both sides.\r\n During the 7-week period between March 10, 2003, and April 28, 2003, a total of 214 patients in whom SARS had been diagnosed were treated at PWH. A further 142 SARS patients were treated at UCH. From a total of 356 patients, the 6 patients reported on here represent an incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax complicating SARS of 1.7%.\r\n The clinical details of the six SARS patients developing spontaneous pneumothoraces are summarized in Table 1 . These patients included four men and two women, with a mean age of 48 years (age range, 32 to 82 years). None of the patients were smokers or had a history of pulmonary disease. Prior to the development of pneumothorax, none of the patients received any invasive procedures to the neck or chest, and none had received positive-pressure ventilatory support.\r\n In each of the six patients, the pneumothorax was first discovered on a chest radiograph that had been taken as a result of an acute increase in dyspnea. The mean time between hospital admission and the appearance of a pneumothorax was 24.3 days (range, 14 to 37 days). At the time of the pneumothorax, all patients were clinically dyspneic, and five required maximal oxygen therapy via masks. They had each received a mean dose of 5.0 g IV methylprednisolone (dose range, 4.5 to 5.5 g). The mean peak lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level for the six patients was 655.5 U\/L (range, 301 to 854 U\/L), and the mean neutrophil count was 14.5 \u03eb 10 9 neutrophils per liter (range, 7.5 \u03eb 10 9 to 21.2 \u03eb 10 9 neutrophils per liter).\r\n Three patients developed bilateral pneumothoraces, two had a right pneumothorax only, and one had a left pneumothorax only. Four patients received chest tube insertions for treatment of the pneumothorax, with three patients (cases 1, 3, and 4) reporting good initial relief of dyspnea.\r\n In all four patients who received chest tube insertion, persistent air leakage was noted. Surgical management was considered for these patients but ultimately was not undertaken. The factors taken into consideration included the severe compromise of each patient's lung function, which contributed to high anesthetic risk, and, most importantly, the ongoing SARS in each patient, which posed a potential infection risk to all operating room staff. 12 It was envisaged that endotracheal intubation, positive-pressure ventilation, lung manipulation during surgery, and the process of postoperative extubation might increase the risk of releasing virus-laden droplets into the operating theater environment. In the presence of a new infectious disease, the means of transmission of which had not been determined at the time, this represented a serious consideration. In case 1, the abundance of pleural adhesions noted on chest radiograph and CT scan also would give rise to a difficult operation with the possibility of intraoperative bleeding and significant postoperative air leakage. This added consideration mitigated against surgery for that patient. Using treatment with chest drainage alone, the air leaks in the four patients spontaneously resolved after a mean duration of 23.5 days (range, 14 to 31 days). In all six cases, pleurodesis, either chemical or surgical, was not used.\r\n Three patients were admitted to the ICU because of exacerbations of dyspnea resulting from pneumothoraces. Two patients (cases 4 and 5) required mechanical ventilatory support for the respiratory distress resulting from their bilateral pneumothoraces. In both cases, the effect of positive-pressure ventilation was to increase air leakage, which was manifested by an increasing pneumothorax despite drainage with a single chest tube in case 4 and surgical emphysema in case 5.\r\n No patient in this study died as a direct result of their pneumothoraces. The patient in case 2 died of multiple organ failure related to generalized systemic inflammation. In case 4, the patient's bilateral pneumothoraces had been adequately drained, and she died from diffuse inflammation of the lungs rather than from mechanical respiratory compromise as a result of the pneumothoraces.\r\n We have shown that spontaneous pneumothorax is a complication in 1.7% of SARS patients. To put this incidence into perspective, a parallel can be drawn between spontaneous pneumothoraces complicating SARS patients and secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces in patients with underlying pneumonia. Such cases are relatively uncommon and have been most prominently reported in immunocompromised patients with AIDS. The reported incidence of secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces in AIDS patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is approximately 2 to 6%. 13 In such patients, P carinii pneumonia may cause peripheral tissue necrosis in the lung, predisposing the patient to pneumothorax.\r\n Several observations support the view that a similar pathogenetic process may occur in SARS patients. The onset of the pneumothorax in these six patients occurred at 14 to 37 days after the initial diagnosis of SARS, suggesting that a sustained period of lung inflammation is first required. All six patients were clinically very dyspneic, with high oxygen requirements and extensive lung radiographic changes at the time of their pneumothorax. All six patients also had high peak LDH levels and neutrophil counts, which are suggestive of a greater extent of pulmonary injury. 2 These observations suggest that extensive pulmonary injury may be a predisposing factor for spontaneous pneumothorax in SARS patients.\r\n When compared to previously published data on SARS patients from PWH, 2 the cases of the six patients presented here show evidence of particularly severe lung injury. The ICU admission rate (66.7%) and the crude mortality rate (33.3%) were higher in these six patients than those in the 138 patients in the earlier study from PWH (23.2% and 13.8%, respectively). 2 That previous study from our institute also had identified absolute neutrophil counts and high peak LDH levels as independent predictors of adverse outcome in SARS patients. 2, 9 The mean neutrophil counts and mean peak LDH levels in the 32 patients with poorer clinical courses (those who were either admitted to the ICU or died because of SARS) were significantly higher than those in the other 106 patients not requiring ICU support. In our six patients, the mean neutrophil count was 14.5 \u03eb 10 9 neutrophils per liter, and the mean peak LDH level was 655.5 U\/L. In comparison, the mean figures for the 32 patients with poorer clinical courses in the earlier study were 4.6 \u03eb 10 9 neutrophils per liter and 629.7 U\/L, respectively. Patients with particularly severe clinical courses, and those with high peak LDH levels and neutrophil counts therefore appear to be the most at risk for developing spontaneous pneumothoraces. In particular, the trend for a higher neutrophil count in our six patients suggests that this may be an indicator for SARS patients who are at risk for developing spontaneous pneumothorax. Histologic findings appear to support the hypothesis of severe pulmonary injury predisposing the patient to spontaneous pneumothorax. In postmortem analyses of other SARS patients, including patients from both PWH and UCH, evidence of histologic damage to the lung tissue by the disease previously has been reported. 2, 9, 14 The pulmonary pathology has been reported to be dominated by diffuse alveolar damage with pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation. The diffuse alveolar damage may give rise to dilated, cystic airspaces in severe cases and a gross appearance of honeycombing. Such destructive changes may predispose the lung to air leakage from the rupture of the cystic lesions, with the consequent development of a pneumothorax. The frequent diffuse involvement of both lungs by these changes also could account for the occurrence of the bilateral pneumothoraces seen in three of our six patients in this series.\r\n A previous study 15 of SARS patients in UCH has identified the fact that spontaneous pneumomediastinum can occur in 12% of SARS patients. The occurrence of pneumomediastinum appeared to be unrelated to intubation and mechanical ventilation. A similar mechanism to that postulated earlier has been speculated to be responsible, with rupturing cysts causing the leakage of air into the mediastinum.\r\n There has been debate among clinicians regarding the use of large doses of steroids in patients with severe sepsis or respiratory disease. Although the experience in Hong Kong has shown steroids to be of value in controlling the rapid and damaging host inflammatory response, 8, 9 we appreciate the concerns of others 16 regarding the potential for steroid-related complications (including an increased risk of infection and impaired wound healing). It can be speculated as to whether aggressive steroid therapy may have a role to play in the pathogenesis of spontaneous pneumothorax in SARS patients. Indeed, the use of steroids to dampen the harmful inflammatory response has become one of the mainstays in the treatment of patients severely afflicted with SARS in Hong Kong. 7, 8 We note that the doses of methylprednisolone received by the six patients reported on are no higher than those given to other SARS patients at PWH and UCH with similar clinical presentations. However, therapy with steroids may delay wound healing and perpetuate air leakage. The high doses of steroids given to the patients in cases 1, 3, 4, and 5 may be partly responsible for the persistent air leaks observed in these patients. In our six patients, no incidence of superinfection secondary to steroid use was noted.\r\n Regarding the management of a spontaneous pneumothorax in SARS patients, conservative measures appeared to offer adequate initial symptomatic management in five of the six patients. Chest tube drainage alone brought about adequate short-term control of symptoms in cases 1, 3, and 4. The patients in cases 2 and 6 refused chest tube insertion yet showed no severe deterioration in their respiratory function. Only in the patient in case 5, who experienced especially severe bilateral pulmonary inflammatory infiltrates, did the initial chest drain insertion not prevent the progression of his respiratory distress leading to intubation and ventilatory support.","sha":"47a84189ed7393a9b8272f3e8d0eedd37aebc528","publish_time":"2004-06-30","authors":"Sihoe, Alan D.L.; Wong, Randolph H.L.; Lee, Alex T.H.; Lau, Lee Sung; Leung, Natalie Y.Y.; Law, Kin Ip; Yim, Anthony P.C.","journal":"Chest","doi":"10.1378\/chest.125.6.2345","Title":"Chest","H index":267.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a form of atypical pneumonia that is caused by a mutant coronavirus, 1 and was first identified as a new disease in February 2003. 8 Between March 10, 2003 , and April 28, 2003, a total of 214 SARS patients were treated at PWH.

A left chest tube was inserted immediately with good symptomatic relief of her dyspnea. Although the chest radiograph showed good reexpansion of the right lung, she developed progressively severe respiratory failure with ground-glass lung infiltrations seen on her subsequent chest radiographs. She died with intractable respiratory failure 4 weeks after ICU admission. He had neither smoked nor experienced any significant medical illness. His chest radiograph on hospital admission showed mild right lower zone infiltration. On the 17th day after hospital admission, increased dyspnea and mild subcutaneous emphysema in the neck were noted, and the chest radiograph (Fig 4) showed a pneumomediastinum and thin rims (\u03fd 1 cm) of pneumothoraces bilaterally. He was transferred to the ICU, and a right chest drain was inserted. A chest radiograph showed the full expansion of both lungs. Therefore, one additional chest drain was inserted on each side. A 32-year-old man who was a nonsmoker presented with a 2-day history of fever (temperature, up to 40\u00b0C), chills, rigors, and myalgia. He was able to maintain borderline oxygenation while receiving maximal oxygen therapy. Chest drain insertion and mechanical ventilation were refused by the patient. Serial chest radiographs showed a gradual reduction in the size of the pneumothoraces. A further 142 SARS patients were treated at UCH. None of the patients were smokers or had a history of pulmonary disease. Three patients developed bilateral pneumothoraces, two had a right pneumothorax only, and one had a left pneumothorax only. Four patients received chest tube insertions for treatment of the pneumothorax, with three patients (cases 1, 3, and 4) reporting good initial relief of dyspnea. This added consideration mitigated against surgery for that patient. Three patients were admitted to the ICU because of exacerbations of dyspnea resulting from pneumothoraces. In case 4, the patient's bilateral pneumothoraces had been adequately drained, and she died from diffuse inflammation of the lungs rather than from mechanical respiratory compromise as a result of the pneumothoraces. We have shown that spontaneous pneumothorax is a complication in 1.7% of SARS patients. 13 In such patients, P carinii pneumonia may cause peripheral tissue necrosis in the lung, predisposing the patient to pneumothorax. In our six patients, the mean neutrophil count was 14.5 \u03eb 10 9 neutrophils per liter, and the mean peak LDH level was 655.5 U\/L. In comparison, the mean figures for the 32 patients with poorer clinical courses in the earlier study were 4.6 \u03eb 10 9 neutrophils per liter and 629.7 U\/L, respectively. In particular, the trend for a higher neutrophil count in our six patients suggests that this may be an indicator for SARS patients who are at risk for developing spontaneous pneumothorax. Although the experience in Hong Kong has shown steroids to be of value in controlling the rapid and damaging host inflammatory response, 8, 9 we appreciate the concerns of others 16 regarding the potential for steroid-related complications (including an increased risk of infection and impaired wound healing). Only in the patient in case 5, who experienced especially severe bilateral pulmonary inflammatory infiltrates, did the initial chest drain insertion not prevent the progression of his respiratory distress leading to intubation and ventilatory support."},{"Unnamed: 0":39,"Unnamed: 0.1":39,"doc_id":"c6b289b848745feb77aa1eff3e78298d92769927","title":"Effi cacy and Safety of Low Dose Recombinant Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator for the Treatment of Acute Pulmonary Thromboembolism A Randomized, Multicenter, Controlled Trial","abstract":"publicly funded repositories, such as the WHO COVID database with rights for unrestricted research re-use and analyses in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source.

Similar to most thrombolytic agents, rt-PA carries a signifi cant dose-dependent risk of bleeding. Optimal dosing that maximizes benefi ts and minimizes bleeding complications is important.\r\n Methods: A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial was conducted in which 118 patients with acute PTE and either hemodynamic instability or massive pulmonary artery obstruction were randomly assigned to receive a treatment regiment of either rt-PA at 50 mg\/2 h (n 5 65) or 100 mg\/2 h (n 5 53). The effi cacy was determined by observing the improvements of right ventricular dysfunctions (RVDs) on echocardiograms, lung perfusion defects on ventilation perfusion lung scans, and pulmonary artery obstructions on CT angiograms. The adverse events, including death, bleeding, and PTE recurrence, were also evaluated. Results: Progressive improvements in RVDs, lung perfusion defects, and pulmonary artery obstructions were found to be similarly signifi cant in both treatment groups. This is true for patients with either hemodynamic instability or massive pulmonary artery obstruction. Three (6%) patients in the rt-PA 100 mg\/2 h group and one (2%) in the rt-PA 50 mg\/2 h group died as the result of either PTE or bleeding. Importantly, the 50 mg\/2 h rt-PA regimen resulted in less bleeding tendency than the 100 mg\/2 h regimen (3% vs 10%), especially in patients with a body weight , 65 kg (14.8% vs 41.2%, P 5 .049). No fatal recurrent PTE was found in either group. Conclusions: Compared with the 100 mg\/2 h regimen, the 50 mg\/2 h rt-PA regimen exhibits similar effi cacy and perhaps better safety in patients with acute PTE.

A central steering committee was formed that was in charge of study design, protocol development and standardization, quality control, and data verification and analysis. The study protocols were reviewed and approved by the institutional boards and ethics committees of all participating centers. Patients enrolled in the study were centrally and randomly assigned to a treatment group with a standard computerized randomization program. The clinical information and images of each patient were reviewed independently by the members of the steering committee.\r\n Patients aged 18 to 75 years with acute PTE and indications for thrombolytic therapy were enrolled. All diagnoses were confi rmed either by a high-probability V\/Q scan or by the presence of an intraluminal fi lling defect on spiral computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) examination. Only patients with symptoms that occurred within 15 days from the time of enrollment were selected. The inclusion criteria were either hemodynamically massive PTE in patients with hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock, or anatomically massive PTE in patients with massive pulmonary artery obstruction (obstructions in more than two lobes on CTPA examination or perfusion defects in more than seven segments on V\/Q scan) with combined RVD and pulmonary hypertension on echocardiographic examination. 11, 12 Studies have shown that such patients are at high risk of fatal conditions and may benefi t from thrombolytic therapy. [13] [14] [15] Patients were excluded if they had received parenteral heparin for more than 72 h or had thrombolytic contraindications. 10, 16, 17 Written informed consents were obtained from all the patients.\r\n Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 50 mg rt-PA or 100 mg rt-PA in continuous intravenous infusion for 2 h ( Fig 1 ) . We used rt-PA (alteplase) from Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma (Shanghai, Republic of China) . The activated partial thromboplastin time was determined after the rt-PA infusion. If the value was , 80 s, a subcutaneous injection of low-molecular-weight heparin (nadroparin, 86 antifactor Xa International Units\/kg) was given every 12 h. Overlapping oral anticoagulant therapy (warfarin) was started on day 1 to 3 after nadroparin injection to maintain an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. Nadroparin was stopped 4 to 5 days after warfarin was added, and Drug Administration and has been recommended in recent guidelines as the standard for PTE thrombolysis. 3, 4 Although this dose is effective, increasing evidence suggests that it has a high rate of bleeding complications. [5] [6] [7] Thus, there is uncertainty regarding whether the rt-PA 100 mg\/2 h regimen is effective for all patients and if it is the optimal rt-PA dosage for PTE thrombolytic therapy. 7, 8 Lower dosages of rt-PA, such as a 50 mg\/2 h regimen, have been used effectively for treating acute myocardial infarction. 9 With potentially fewer bleeding complications, rt-PA at 50 mg\/2 h may be a better regimen for PTE treatment as well. However, no direct comparison of rt-PA at 50 mg\/2 h and rt-PA at 100 mg\/2 h regimens has been conducted in patients with PTE. It is unclear whether the rt-PA at 50 mg\/2 h regimen is indeed a better dosage for PTE.\r\n In this study, we compared the effi cacy and safety of the rt-PA at 50 mg\/2 h with the rt-PA at 100 mg\/2 h regimen in patients with acute PTE. Patients with acute PTE and either hemodynamic instability 10 or massive pulmonary artery obstruction and right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) 3,10 were enrolled. Effi cacy was assessed by the improvements of right ventricular functions on echocardiograms, perfusion defects on ventilation perfusion (V\/Q) lung scans, and pulmonary artery obstructions on CT angiograms. The adverse events, including death, bleeding, and PTE recurrence, were also evaluated. were analyzed using repeated measures of analysis of variance. Subgroup analysis was also conducted based on the hemodynamic status of the PTEs. All reported P values are two-sided, and P , .05 was considered statistically signifi cant.\r\n A\r\n A total of 127 patients were screened in the multiple centers. Nine (7%) patients were ineligible and were excluded according to the predefined exclusion criteria. Among the 118 patients enrolled in the study, 53 were assigned to receive 100 mg of rt-PA and 65 were assigned to receive 50 mg of rt-PA (see Fig 1 ) . There were no signifi cant differences between the two groups in regard to baseline characteristics ( Table 1 ) .\r\n The improvements of pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular function were evaluated by echocardiography. The baseline, 24-h, and 14-day follow-up evaluations of RVED\/LVED, RVWM, and SPAP were performed in 97 (82%) patients, 45 in the 100 mg rt-PA group and 52 in the 50 mg rt-PA group. Both treatment groups showed signifi cantly progressive improvements of right ventricular function as determined by all three measurements. No significant difference was found between the two treatment groups using these measurements at different time points ( Fig 2 A ) . Improvement of lung perfusion was determined by V\/Q lung scan. The baseline, 24-h, and 14-day follow-up V\/Q lung scans were conducted in 79 (67%) patients, 37 in the high-dose group and 42 in the lowdose group. Both treatments achieved signifi cant improvements in pulmonary vascular perfusion defects, with similar defect scores at 24 h and 14 days after rt-PA administration ( Fig 2 B ) .\r\n The improvement of pulmonary artery obstruction was assessed by CTPA. A total of 103 patients (87%) underwent baseline, 24-h, and 14-day follow-up CTPAs; 48 in the high-dose group and 55 in the lowdose group. Quantitative assessment showed that the two treatment groups had substantial reductions in the PTE obstructive index at different time points after treatment, with no signifi cant difference between the groups ( Fig 2 C ) . The distributions of signifi cant improvement, slight improvement, no change, and worsening status were similar between the two regimens ( Table 2 ) .\r\n The mortality was low in both groups, with three (6%) patient deaths in the high-dose group (two due the INR was stabilized at 2.0 to 3.0 for at least 2 days. Warfarin was continuously used for at least 3 to 6 months, and subsequent doses were adjusted to maintain the INR within the 2.0 to 3.0 range, targeting a value of 2.5.\r\n Symptoms and signs of PTE in all patients were monitored. Echocardiograms, V\/Q lung scans, and CTPA were evaluated within 48 h before rt-PA infusion and repeated in most patients at 24 h and 14 days after rt-PA treatment. Effi cacy was determined by observing the improvements of right ventricular functions on echocardiograms, lung perfusion on lung V\/Q scans, and pulmonary artery obstruction on CTPA.\r\n Echocardiograms: Echocardiographic examinations were performed and analyzed by two echocardiographers. Right ventricular function was analyzed by observing improvement of (1) the right and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ratio in the parasternal long-axis view (RVED\/LVED); (2) right ventricular wall movements (RVWM); and (3) estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP), in the absence of left ventricular disease or mitral valve disease as previously reported. 14, 15 V\/Q Lung Scans: Lung scans were independently reviewed and evaluated by two specialists using the methods described previously. 18, 19 Each anatomic segment of the lung was reviewed, and any defect within each segment was scored according to the level of perfusion reduction.\r\n The location and severity of thrombus obstruction of the pulmonary vascular bed were reviewed and evaluated using the helical CTPA score system described in previous studies. 20, 21 The index is defi ned as the product of N 3 D, where N is the value of the proximal clot site (equal to the number of segmental branches arising distally), and D is the degree of obstruction. Partial obstruction is scored as 1, and total obstruction is graded as 2.\r\n Adverse events were monitored for 14 days after initial treatment with rt-PA. Deaths were classifi ed as being due to PTE, bleeding, or other causes (including myocardial infarction and unknown causes). Major bleeding included cases of fatal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), or a drop in the hemoglobin concentration by at least 20 g\/L or a drop that required transfusion of more than 400 mL of RBCs (within 72 h of initiating rt-PA therapy). Minor bleeding included cases of bleeding with a hemoglobin concentration drop , 20 g\/L. Recurrence of PTE was confi rmed by V\/Q scanning or spiral CTPA.\r\n Calculation of the sample size demonstrated that 110 patients were required to show a difference of 10 points between treatment groups in percentage reduction of the score on CTPA at 24 h from the onset of thrombolysis with 80% power and a two-sided level of signifi cance of P , .05, assuming a standard deviation of 10 points. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.\r\n Categorical data were compared using the x 2 test and Fisher exact test (2 3 2 table). Comparison of continuous data between the treatment groups was performed using the t test or Wilcoxon test as appropriate. Changes in the measurements of echocardiograms, V\/Q lung scans, and CT pulmonary angiograms over time bleeding occurred more in the 100 mg rt-PA group than in the 50 mg rt-PA group (10% vs 3%, P 5 .288). One fatal bleeding episode with ICH occurred in the 100 mg rt-PA group ( Table 3 ) . There were three nonfatal recurrent PTEs during the fi rst 14 days after rt-PA therapy: two (4 %) patients in the 100 mg rt-PA group and one (2%) in the 50 mg rt-PA group ( Table 3 ) .\r\n to PTE combined with respiratory and congestive heart failure and one due to ICH) and one (2%) patient death in the low-dose group (due to PTE combined with respiratory and congestive heart failure). The total bleeding prevalence was relatively higher in the 100 mg rt-PA group compared with the 50 mg rt-PA group (32% vs 17%, P 5 .084). Major (Fig 3) .\r\n The 50 mg rt-PA regimen exhibited the same efficacy as the 100 mg rt-PA regimen in PTE thrombolytic therapy. The two regimens showed similar progressive improvements in RVDs, lung perfusion defects, and pulmonary artery obstructions in patients with either hemodynamic instability or massive pulmonary artery obstruction. Although the overall prevalence of death and PTE recurrence was similar between the two treatments, the 50 mg rt-PA group presented with less bleeding, especially in lowbody-weight patients.\r\n Although rt-PA has been shown to be effective in treating acute PTE, the optimal regimens are less defi ned. 22-25 Several studies have indicated that lowerdose rt-PA infusion may be similarly effective in improving clinical presentation and lung perfusion defects in PTE compared with the conventional rt-PA 100 mg regimen. 8, 26, 27 Consistent with these studies, our study clearly showed that the rt-PA 50 mg\/2 h regimen produced similar improvements in right ventricular functions, lung perfusion defects, and pulmonary artery obstructions as compared with the rt-PA 100 mg\/2 h regimen.\r\n Further subgroup comparisons were conducted separately in patients with hemodynamic instability and in patients with massive pulmonary artery obstruction. In patients with hemodynamic instability, 50 mg rt-PA and 100 mg rt-PA produced similar progressive improvements in pulmonary artery obstructions. Additionally, no difference was found between these two treatments in terms of death, bleeding, and PTE recurrence in these patients ( Table 4 ) Similarly, these two treatments showed similar effi cacy and safety in patients with massive pulmonary vascular obstruction.\r\n We further compared the effi cacy and safety of the two dose regimens in patients with different body weights. Patients were divided into groups either by the tertiles of body weight or by the tertiles of BMI. As shown in Table 5 , the CTPA scores did not differ Data presented are number (%) of patients. Improvements of pulmonary artery obstruction from baseline between two treatments were compared. See Table 1 for expansion of abbreviations. a Any improvement (%) 5 (signifi cant + slight)\/total, which indicates the percentage of overall improvement. Signifi cant improvement 5 obstruction decreased by \u0546 75%; slight improvement 5 obstruction decreased by \u0546 25% but , 75%; no change 5 obstruction reduced by , 25%; worse 5 obstruction increased in score index. \r\n Thrombolysis is associated with the risk of bleeding complications. [34] [35] [36] ICH is one of the most serious complications of thrombolytic therapy. 37 Although the In our practice, we use thrombolytic therapy instead of anticoagulation therapy alone to treat patients with extensive pulmonary artery obstruction (defi ned as an obstruction exceeding 50% of the pulmonary vasculature or the occlusion of two or more lobar arteries with RVD). [28] [29] [30] [31] Even when presented with normal systemic arterial pressure, these patients are at risk for deteriorating conditions and have worse prognoses. 21, 32 Studies have shown that these patients may benefi t from thrombolytic therapy. 13, 33 In the current study, therefore, we included these patients. Although this inclusion may make our effi cacy comparison of the two regimens less conclusive, subgroup analysis showed that the 50 mg rt-PA regimen was effective not only for patients with massive pulmonary artery obstruction but also for patients with hemodynamic instability. Nevertheless, future studies with anticoagulation control in patients with massive pulmonary artery obstruction will be valuable in determining whether thrombolytic therapy is indeed benefi cial in these patients.\r\n Further comparison of the two dose regimens in patients with different body weights showed that the two treatments produced similar effi cacy in high-, medium-, or low-body-weight groups. This observation indicates that both doses may have reached therapeutic threshold and are similarly effective in all body-weight subgroups in our patients. However, additional analysis on patients with body weights greater than 100 kg or BMIs greater than 30 kg\/m 2 was not conducted in our study because of the small sample size. Further studies are desirable to examine the efficacy of the 50 mg regimen in this patient population. Data presented are mean 6 SD unless otherwise indicated. See Table 1 for expansion of abbreviations. rates in our study (2%-6%) are comparable to those in previous clinical trials, 5, 26, 27, 34, 35 but signifi cantly lower than those in the International Cooperative Pulmonary Embolism Registry study (23%). 38 The high mortality rate in the retrospective registry study was probably the result of the enrollment of more seriously ill patients.\r\n There are a few limitations in our study. First, the small sample size, a common limitation for PTE thrombolytic studies, prevented us from achieving more powerful effi cacy and safety analyses. This is particularly true for the effi cacy analysis in patients with hemodynamic instability and in patients with higher body weight, as well as for the mortality and PTE recurrence evaluations in all patients. Future studies with larger sample sizes are desirable to examine the effi cacy and safety of the 50 mg regimen in these patient populations. Second, although physicians evaluating the imaging studies were blinded to the treatment assignments, physicians treating patients were not. This open-label study may potentially introduce bias to a certain degree. Last, a control group using heparin alone was not included for patients with extensive pulmonary artery obstruction and right ventricular dysfunction. Future studies using anticoagulation control will be valuable to determine whether thrombolytic therapy is indeed benefi cial in these patients. difference was not statistically signifi cant, previous studies demonstrated that the prevalence of ICH was relatively higher in patients receiving 100 mg rt-PA. 2, 26, 34 In our study, we observed that the overall bleeding rate was signifi cantly lower in the 50 mg rt-PA group than that in the 100 mg ft-PA group. This difference was even more obvious in patients with a body weight , 65 kg or BMI , 24 kg\/m 2 . A similar trend was also found in major bleeding. The rate of major bleeding in our study (3%-10%) is comparable to previously reported trials. 5, 26, 27, 34, 35 Our fi ndings suggest that an rt-PA dose of 50 mg may be safer, especially in patients with lower body weights. We recommend that this dose can be safely used for patients with body weight , 65 kg. Further studies with larger patient populations would be useful to validate these fi ndings.\r\n One major criterion in evaluating thrombolytic therapy for PTE is the recurrence of embolisms, which occur mostly during the fi rst week of follow-up after initial treatment and can result in a high mortality rate. The PTE recurrence was low in the two therapy groups: one patient (2%) in the 50 mg rt-PA group and two (4%) in the 100 mg rt-PA group, which is consistent with previous studies. 27, 38 Although the difference is far from signifi cant ( P 5 .42) with our sample size, our study showed that the mortality was lower in the 50 mg rt-PA group (2%) than in the 100 mg rt-PA group (6%). This seems the result of both less fatal bleeding and less recurrent PTE in the 50 mg rt-PA group.

We studied the dispersion of exhaled air through a simple oxygen mask applied to a human patient simulator (HPS) during the delivery of different oxygen flow in a room free of air currents. Methods: The HPS represented a 70-kg adult male individual in a semi-sitting position on a hospital bed inclined at 45 o . A simple oxygen mask was fitted to the HPS in the normal fashion. The head, neck, and internal airways of the HPS were configured to allow realistic airflow modeling in the airways and around the face. The HPS was programmed to breathe at a respiratory rate of 14 breaths\/min with a tidal volume of 0.5 L. Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualization. A leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light-sheet, and images were captured by high-resolution video. Smoke concentration in the exhaled plume was estimated from the total light intensity scattered by smoke particles. Findings: A jet plume of air leaked through the side vents of the simple oxygen mask to lateral distances of 0.2, 0.22, 0.3, and 0.4 m from the sagittal plane during the delivery of oxygen at 4, 6, 8, and 10 L\/min, respectively. Coughing could extend the dispersion distance beyond 0.4 m.

Confusion, uremia, tachypnea, hypoten-sion, and age \u03fe 65 years are some of the clinical indications for managing patients with CAP in the hospital setting. 1, 2 Various modalities of respiratory support are often required by patients with CAP, and these include supplemental oxygen delivered via either nasal cannula or different types of face masks, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV), and invasive mechanical ventilation.\r\n There is a strong association among ventilation, air movement in buildings, and the transmission of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 3 In patients who are hospitalized with viral pneumonia, there is a potential risk that the respiratory therapy itself may generate and disperse infective aerosols, resulting in a superspreading event. The use of a nebulizer in an overcrowded medical ward with inadequate ventilation was thought to be the cause of a major nosocomial outbreak of SARS in our hospital in 2003. 4 -6 Influenza virus A\/H5N1 has become the major emerging infectious disease of global concern since late 2003. The widespread occurrence of the H5N1 avian influenza infection in poultry and birds on several continents has increased the risk of human exposure to avian influenza. Respiratory failure is the major complication in patients who are hospitalized with influenza A\/H5N1 infection, and many patients progress rapidly to ARDS and multiorgan failure. 7 As part of our influenza pandemic preparedness, we studied the safety of oxygen therapy by examining exhaled air dispersion from a simple oxygen mask attached to a human patient simulator (HPS) during the delivery of oxygen at different levels of flow.\r\n This study was conducted in a quiet laboratory room that was 7.1 \u03eb 8.5 m in size with a height of 2.7 m. The room ventilation was temporarily suspended during the experiment to avoid potentially confounding environmental factors, such as ventilation air currents. The experimental design and method of data analysis have been described in detail in our previous study 8 on exhaled air dispersion related to NPPV.\r\n We studied the air particle leakage from the side vents of a simple oxygen mask (HS-3031; Hsiner; Taichung Hsien, Taiwan) applied to a high-fidelity HPS (HPS 6.1; Medical Education Technologies Inc; Sarasota, FL) [Fig 1] . The HPS contains a realistic airway and a lung model that undergoes gas exchange (ie, it removes oxygen and adds carbon dioxide to the system). The lung compliance and airway resistance also respond in a realistic manner to relevant challenges. In addition, the HPS produces an airflow pattern that is close to the in vivo human situation and has been applied in previous studies 9 -13 to simulate human respiration. In this study, we set the lung compliance and oxygen consumption of the HPS to 35 mL\/cm H 2 O and 350 mL\/min, respectively. This represented a patient with mild lung injury. 14, 15 Tidal volume and respiratory rate were regulated so that a respiratory exchange ratio of 0.8 was maintained during the measurements. In this setting, the HPS breathed at a respiratory rate of 14 breaths\/min with a tidal volume of 0.5 L. Oxygen flow was delivered to the HPS via the simple mask at 4 L\/min initially, which was gradually increased to 6, 8, and 10 L\/min during the study.\r\n While the HPS was breathing oxygen at 6 L\/min, cough was produced by a short burst (2 s, 400 L\/min) of air (marked by smoke) generated by a jet ventilator (Monsoon; Acutronic Medical Systems; Baar, Switzerland) connected to the proximal trachea. This represented cough efforts in patients with mild lung injury. 16 \r\n The visualization of airflow around the simple oxygen mask was facilitated by marking air with smoke particles produced by a smoke generator (M-6000 N19; DS Electronics; Tempe, AZ). 8 The oil-based smoke particles, which measured \u03fd 1 m in diameter, are known to follow the airflow pattern precisely with negligible slip. 17 The smoke was introduced continuously to the right main bronchus of the HPS. It mixed with alveolar gas and then was exhaled through the airway. Jet plume leakage in sections was then revealed using a thin laser light-sheet that was created by an Nd:YVO 4 Q-switched, frequency-doubled laser (OEM T20-BL 10 -106Q; Spectra Physics, Inc; Mountain View, CA) with custom-made cylindrical optics for two-dimensional laser light-sheet generation. 8 The experiments were recorded with a video system (DV video system [3 charge-coupled device, \u03eb48 zoom, 30-Hz]; Sony; Tokyo, Japan). The laser light-sheet (green, 527-nm wavelength, in TEM 00 mode) was adjusted to encompass the largest crosssection of the entire leakage jet plume. The light-sheet was initially positioned in the median sagittal plane of the HPS and was subsequently shifted to the paramedian planes. This allowed us to investigate the regions directly above and lateral to the mask and the patient. 8 \r\n We estimated the normalized smoke concentration of the oxygen mask leakage jet plume from the light scattered by the smoke particles. 8 This extended the laser flow visualization and Figure 1 . A simple oxygen mask attached to a high-fidelity HPS with a laser light-sheet on the right side. The simulator represented a 70-kg adult male sitting on a hospital bed inclined to 45 o and was programmed to breathe spontaneously. The lung compliance was set as 35 mL\/cm H 2 O, and the oxygen consumption to 350 mL\/min. Tidal volume and respiratory rate were regulated so that a respiratory exchange ratio of 0.8 was maintained during measurements. Typically, this was achieved with a tidal volume of 500 mL at a rate of 14 breaths\/min. These conditions represent a patient with mild lung injury.\r\n www.chestjournal.org CHEST \/ 132 \/ 2 \/ AUGUST, 2007 provided a useful quantitative method for understanding the range and shape of the leakage jet plumes. This analysis technique was previously developed for turbulent two-phase, airparticle flows and was as reliable as the isokinetic sampling 18 or particle image velocimetry that was used in a previous study. 19 The laser light-sheet illuminated the smoke particles around the oxygen mask. We assumed that the intensity of the laser light-sheet was near constant because the oxygen mask was positioned relatively far from the light-sheet optics (ie, the point of divergence). The laser light scattered by the smoke particles was then collected and integrated by the video camera chargecoupled device elements. For a small region, the number of smoke particles within the region (or particle concentration) is proportional to the total scattered light intensity in that corresponding region. This is true as the smoke particles are monodisperse. 17, 20, 21 Image Capture and Frame Extraction\r\n The motion video of several breathing cycles for a given oxygen flow rate setting was captured by a computer, and individual frames were extracted as grayscale bitmap images for intensity analysis. Frames were extracted at times relative to the beginning of inspiration (at a given oxygen flow rate) to generate an ensemble average for the corresponding instant of the respiratory cycle. 8 The largest spread of contours from the mask was chosen, and this was found to be at approximately the mid-point of the respiratory cycle.\r\n All grayscale frames were read into a program that was specifically developed for this study (MathCad, version 8.0; Parametric Technology Corp; Needham, MA) 22 along with background intensity images taken with the laser switched off. The background intensity image was subtracted from each frame, pixel by pixel to remove any stray background light, and the pixel intensity values were averaged over all frames to determine the ensemble-averaged intensity. The resulting image was the total intensity of light scattered perpendicular to the light-sheet by the smoke particles and is directly proportional to the smoke concentration. The image was normalized against the highest intensity found within the leakage jet plume to generate normalized particle concentration contours.\r\n As the smoke particles marked air that originated from the airways of the HPS, before leaking from the mask, the concentration contours effectively represent the probability of encountering air around the patient that has come from within the mask and\/or the patient's respiratory system. The probability contours are made up of data collected from 10 breaths. A contour value of 1 indicates a region that consists entirely of air leaked after exhalation by the patient; where there is a 100% chance of exposure to the exhaled air, such as at the oxygen mask side vent. A value near 0 indicates no measurable air leakage in the region and a small chance of exposure to exhaled air. 8\r\n The final analysis step scaled the contour image to the dimensions of the measurement region and corrected any optical distortions introduced by the camera and lens. Scaling and image distortion correction mapped the image in pixel coordinates back into the actual measurement region coordinates (in millimeters). Nonlinear mapping functions were determined by experimentally \"testing\" the camera and lens system. An accurate target grid placed in the measurement region was imaged, and the image coordinates were compared to those on the grid to calculate third-order polynomial mapping functions using a least squares method. 23, 24 Previous work by Hall 18 has shown this approach to be reliable, with a variance on contours not exceeding 5%, but often \u03fd 3%. The maximum error on the x-y position from image distortion correction was \u03ee 4 mm for this study. The study received nonionizing radiation and biological\/chemical safety approval by the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\r\n The results of air particle dispersion distances are presented with reference to the median sagittal plane.\r\n The first scenario was conducted with the oxygen flow delivered at 4 L\/min. Probability contours of air leakage distribution around the patient and oxygen mask in the median sagittal plane are shown in Figure 2 , top left, A. The 20% probability contour line (green\/blue contour boundary) was taken as an arbitrary boundary that was representative of the exhaled air plume, and all distances were estimated to be outside of this boundary. Outside this boundary, the probability of exposure to the patient's exhaled air was \u03fd 20%. The leakage plume from the side vent of the simple mask was noted to a distance of 0.2 m lateral to the median sagittal plane for contours of \u03fe 20%.\r\n Probability contours of air leakage distribution around the HPS and oxygen mask in the median sagittal plane when oxygen was delivered at 6, 8, and 10 L\/min are shown in Figure 2 The relationships between different oxygen flows and the resultant leakage plume distances are shown in Figure 3 . Although the data are not correlated in a linear fashion, it is obvious that the higher the oxygen flow, the higher the leakage distances.\r\n The effect of coughing on the exhaled air dispersion distance while the HPS was receiving 6 L\/min of oxygen via the simple mask is shown in Figure 4 . The leakage plume through the side vent of the simple mask was noted to stretch to distances of 0.4 and 0.2 m lateral to the median sagittal plane for contours of \u03fe 25% and \u03fe 60%, respectively.\r\n This study was a \"worse-case\" scenario using the breathing patterns of a healthy man, in a room that was free of air currents, and an extremely fineparticle tracer in order to demonstrate the maximum distribution of exhaled air. Using laser smoke visualization methods, we have shown that exhaled air . Exhaled air dispersion during coughing. While the HPS was breathing oxygen at 6 L\/min, cough was produced by a short burst (2 s, 400 L\/min) of air (marked by smoke) generated by a jet ventilator connected to the proximal trachea. This represented cough efforts in a patient with mild lung injury. 16 Although the video camera was not able to capture the maximum dispersion distance beyond 0.4 m for contours of \u03fe 20%, the leakage plume through the side vent of the simple mask was noted to stretch to distances of 0.4 and 0.2 m lateral to the median sagittal plane for contours of \u03fe 25% and \u03fe 60%, respectively. Fig 2, top  right, B) to 0.2 m while the HPS was receiving 6 L\/min of oxygen with at least a 60% chance of exposure within that distance. These findings have important clinical implications for the health-care workers who often manage patients with respiratory failure due to CAP of unknown etiology at a short distance. It is important to provide adequate respiratory protection for the health-care workers, in addition to applying standard, contact, and droplet precautions in order to prevent nosocomial infections. During the major outbreak of SARS in 2003, respiratory failure was the major complication in the second week of the illness, when about half of the patients required supplemental oxygen in order to maintain satisfactory oxygenation. 25 Health-care workers were particularly vulnerable to SARS as the viral load of SARS coronavirus in patients increased to peak level on day 10 of the illness. 26 A case-control study 27 involving 124 medical wards in 26 hospitals in Guangzhou and Hong Kong has identified SARS patients requiring oxygen therapy or NPPV as independent risk factors for superspreading nosocomial outbreaks of SARS. While the major routes for the transmission of SARS were related to infected droplets and fomites, as is usually the case in patients with viral pneumonia, 28 there was evidence that SARS might have been spread by airborne transmission. 29 -32 It was not entirely clear whether different modalities of respiratory support had contributed to the nosocomial outbreaks of SARS through the generation of infective aerosols, but our previous study 8 showed that substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within a 0.5-m radius of patients who are receiving NPPV.\r\n Few studies have assessed the potential risk of oxygen therapy in spreading respiratory infection. Using an aerosolized 3% hypertonic saline solution and photographic techniques, Somogyi et al 33 demonstrated that throughout exhalation both the nonrebreathing and Venturi-type of oxygen masks could produce potentially infectious plumes of exhaled air that could be inhaled by health-care workers, whereas the addition of an expiratory port and a filter to an oxygen mask (Hi-Ox80; VIASYS Healthcare; Yorba Linda, CA) could reduce aerosol production. 33 Using a laser visualization technique and a mathematical model that was different from the one used in the current study for data analysis, we have previously shown a maximal dispersion distance of approximately 0.4 m during the application of oxygen at 4 L\/min via a simple mask to the HPS, which was programmed at a respiratory rate of 12 breaths\/min and a tidal volume of 0.5 L. 34 Our previous study 8 relied on image-processing techniques to define the edge of the visible smoke boundary from the captured digital video images, which represented the \"peak\" of simulated exhalation during one breath cycle by the HPS. 34 The current study, which is based on our previous work on the safety of NPPV, 8 has the advantage of allowing the smoke concentration in the exhaled plume to be estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles, whereas the probability contours were made up of data collected from at least 10 breaths. Outside the boundary contour of 20%, the probability of exposure to a patient's exhaled air was \u03fd 20% in this study.\r\n This study was limited by the use of smoke particles as markers for exhaled air. The inertia and weight of larger droplets in an air-droplet, two-phase flow would certainly cause them to have less horizontal dispersion than the continuous air carrier phase in which they traveled. However, the evaporation of water content in some droplets during oxygen therapy may produce droplet nuclei that are suspended in air, whereas the larger droplets will fall to the ground in a trajectory pathway. As the smoke particles in this study mark the continuous air phase, our data contours refer to exhaled air. Our results would represent the \"upper bound\" estimates for the dispersion of droplets that would be expected to follow a shorter trajectory than the air jet due to gravitational effects, but would not fully reflect the risk of droplet transmission. 8 Second, the room airflow was switched off during the experiment in order to reveal the maximum distribution of exhaled air without interference by external factors. Further work is needed to assess the interaction between ward ventilation and the dispersion distances related to oxygen therapy. Last, we were unable to capture the maximum dispersion distance during coughing due to the limitation of the equipment used in this study. A higher speed camera with a wider laser beam will be required in future studies to detect the full range of dispersion distances during maneuvers such as coughing and sneezing.\r\n A recent review 3 has demonstrated a strong asso-ciation among ventilation, air movements in buildings, and the transmission\/spread of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, influenza, and SARS, but there are insufficient data to specify and quantify the minimum ventilation requirements in hospitals and isolation rooms in relation to the spread of infectious diseases via the airborne route. In a study of the dispersion characteristics of polydispersed droplets in a general hospital ward equipped with a ceiling-mixing type of ventilation system, the small droplets or droplet nuclei (initial size, \u0545 45 m) behaved as airborne-transmittable particles (ie, staying airborne for \u03fe 360 s) and the dispersions were strongly affected by the ward ventilation airflow pattern, with the expiratory droplets exhibiting an initial rapid dispersion followed by slower dispersion in the subsequent stage. 35 In contrast, large droplets (initial sizes, 87.5 and 137.5 m) were subjected to gravitational effects and stayed airborne for \u03fd 30 s, demonstrating the upper-bound reasoning that was discussed previously in this article. 35 Thus, the location of exhaust air vents on the medical ward has a significant impact on the dispersion pattern of expiratory droplets.\r\n In conclusion, we have shown in a worst-case scenario that substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within 0.4 m of patients receiving supplemental oxygen via a simple oxygen mask but that coughing can extend the dispersion distance further. Health-care workers must take precautions when managing patients with CAP of unknown etiology that is complicated by respiratory failure. In addition to maintaining contact, droplet, and standard precautions among the health-care workers when providing routine care to patients infected with H5N1 influenza, the World Health Organization recommends airborne precautions in health-care facilities including placing patients with suspected and confirmed H5N1 influenza in isolation rooms with at least 12 air exchanges per hour (if available) during aerosol-generating procedures due to the high lethality of the disease and the uncertainty about the mode of human-to-human transmission. 36 While other investigators have examined the filtration capacity of different surgical and N95 masks in protecting health-care workers from viral infection, [37] [38] [39] further studies are needed to examine the dispersion of exhaled air from common respiratory therapy devices in relation to the air exchange rate and airflow patterns on the medical ward in the control of airborne viral infections.","sha":"3d2c1c848225a99f51159739a87d008e33480247","publish_time":"2007-08-31","authors":"Hui, David S.; Hall, Stephen D.; Chan, Matthew T.V.; Chow, Benny K.; Ng, Susanna S.; Gin, Tony; Sung, Joseph J.Y.","journal":"Chest","doi":"10.1378\/chest.07-0636","Title":"Chest","H index":267.0,"transmission_indicator":true,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"C ommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder with significant morbidity and mortality.

The continued circulation of the H5N1 virus in migratory birds and the widespread occurrence of the H5N1 avian influenza infection in poultry and birds in several continents have increa-sed the risk of human exposure to avian influenza. 2 Respiratory failure is the major complication in and multiorgan failure, requiring intensive care support. [2] [3] [4] Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) may play a limited supportive role for early ARDS\/acute lung injury as a bridge to invasive mechanical ventilation in an influenza pandemic, although it is contraindicated in critically ill patients with multiorgan failure and hemodynamic instability. 5, 6 However, as influenza virus may be contained in fine particles generated during tidal breathing, 7 the application of NPPV may further disperse potentially infected aerosols and contribute to nosocomial transmission of influenza. We have previously reported 8 that exhaled air particles could be dispersed up to a radial distance of 0.5 m from patients receiving NPPV using the Ultra Mirage mask (ResMed; Bella Vista, NSW, Australia). This current study aimed to examine the directions and dispersion distances of exhaled air during application of NPPV via other commonly used face masks. Knowledge about the directions and extent of exhaled air leakage in different masks is essential for the development of preventive measures to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission during application of NPPV to these high risk patients in an influenza pandemic.\r\n The experiments were conducted in one of 36 double-door, negative-pressure (\u03ea5 Pa) isolation rooms specifically constructed on the top floor of the hospital after the major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to facilitate the management of patients with highly infectious diseases. 9 The isolation room measured 2.8 \u03eb 4.22 \u03eb 2.4 m (Fig 1) . The experimental design and method of data analysis have been described in detail in our previous studies 8,10 -12 on exhaled air dispersion related to the application of NPPV, simple oxygen mask, and jet nebulizer.\r\n We studied the deliberate leakage from the exhalation ports of ComfortFull 2 (Fig 2A) and Image 3 ( Fig 2B) masks (Respironics; Murrysville, PA), firmly attached to a high fidelity human-patient simulator (HPS) [HPS 6.1; Medical Education Technologies Inc; Sarasota, FL]. The HPS represented a 70-kg adult man sitting on a 45\u00b0inclined hospital bed. It was programmed to breathe spontaneously to mimic mild lung injury. The lung compliance was set as 35 mL\/cm H 2 O, and the oxygen consumption was set as 300 mL\/min. Tidal volume and respiratory rate were regulated so that a respiratory exchange ratio of 0.8 was maintained during measurements. Typically, this was achieved with a tidal volume of 300 mL and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths\/min. 13, 14 The HPS contains a realistic airway and a lung model that undergoes gas exchange by removing oxygen and adding carbon dioxide to the system simultaneously. The lung compliance and Figure 1 . The room dimension and equipment layout inside the negative-pressure isolation room. The camera (arrow a) and the laser device (arrow b) were positioned along the coronal plane on the left side of the patient and along the sagittal plane of the patient at the end of the bed, respectively. Two fresh air diffusers, serving as air inlets, were mounted on the ceiling (arrow c). The negative pressure of the isolation room was provided by the air exhausts positioned at the bottom of the bed (arrow d).\r\n airway resistance also responds in a realistic manner to relevant respiratory challenges. In addition, the HPS produces an airflow pattern that is close to the in vivo situation and has been applied in previous studies [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] to simulate human respiration.\r\n NPPV was applied using a bilevel positive airway pressure device (VPAP III ST; ResMed) via each mask. The inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) was initially set at 10 cm H 2 O and gradually increased to 18 cm H 2 O. The expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) was maintained at 4 cm H 2 O throughout the study. 8 \r\n The visualization of airflow around each NPPV face mask was facilitated by marking the air with smoke particles (M-6000 smoke generator, N19; DS Electronics; Sydney, NSW, Australia), as in our previous studies. 8,10 -12 The oil-based smoke particles, measuring \u03fd 1 m in diameter, are known to follow the airflow pattern precisely with negligible slip. 20 The smoke was introduced continuously to the right main bronchus of the HPS. It mixed with alveolar gas and then exhaled through the airway. Sections through the leakage jet plume were then revealed by a thin laser light sheet (green, 532-nm wavelength, continuouswave mode) created by a diode-pumped solid stated laser (OEM UGH-800 mW; Lambdapro Technologies; Beijing, People's Republic of China) with custom cylindrical optics for two-dimensional laser light sheet generation. 8,10 -12 The light sheet was initially positioned in the median sagittal plane of the HPS and was subsequently shifted to the paramedian sagittal planes. This allowed us to investigate the regions directly above and lateral to the mask and the HPS. 8,10 -12 All leakage jet plume images revealed by the laser light sheet were captured by the high-definition video camera (Sony highdefinition digital video camcorder, HDR-SR8E ClearVid complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensor; Sony; Tokyo, Japan [with Vario-Sonnar T* Lens; Carl Zeiss; Jena, Germany]) with an optical resolution of 1,440 \u03eb 1,080 pixels per video frame. Normalized smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light intensity scattered by smoke particles. 8,10 -12\r\n We estimated normalized smoke concentration in the mask leakage air from the light scattered by the particles. The analysis was based on scattered light intensity being proportional to particle concentration under the special conditions of constant intensity laser light sheet illumination and monodisperse, small (submicromolar) particles. 20 In short, the thin laser light sheet of near constant intensity illuminated smoke particle markers in the mask airflow leakage. Smoke particles scattered laser light perpendicular to the light sheet, and the data were collected and integrated by the video camera element and lens. 8,10 -12\r\n The motion video of at least 20 breathing cycles for each NPPV setting was captured, and individual frames were extracted as gray-scale bitmaps for intensity analysis. Frames were extracted at times initiated from the beginning of each inspiration to generate an ensemble average for the corresponding instant of the respiratory cycle. 8,10 -12 The time at which the normalized concentration contours spread over the widest region from the NPPV mask was chosen for the ensemble average to estimate the greatest dispersion distance. This was found to be approximately at the mid-respiratory cycle. 8 \r\n All gray-scale frames were read into a program specifically developed for this study (MathCad 8.0; MathSoft Inc; Cambridge, MA) 21 along with background intensity images taken with the laser switched off. The background intensity image was subtracted from each frame pixel by pixel to remove any stray background light, and the pixel intensity values were averaged over all frames to determine the ensemble-averaged intensity. The resulting image was the total intensity of light scattered perpendicular to the light sheet by the smoke particles and was directly proportional to smoke concentration under the conditions mentioned above. The image was normalized against the highest intensity found within the leakage jet plume to generate normalized particle concentration contours. 8,10 -12 As the smoke particles marked air that originated from the airways of the HPS before leaking from the mask, the concentration contours effectively represent the probability of encountering air around the patient that has come from within the mask and\/or the respiratory system of the patient. The normalized concentration contours are made up of data collected from at least 20 breaths. A contour value of 1 indicates a region that consists entirely of air exhaled by the patient, where there is a very high chance of exposure to the exhaled air, such as at the mask exhaust vents. A value near 0 indicates no measurable air leakage in the region and a small chance of exposure to the exhaled air. 8,10 -12 The study received nonionizing radiation and biological\/chemical safety approval by the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\r\n The results are presented with reference to the median sagittal plane.\r\n The first scenario was conducted with the bilevel positive airway pressure device (VPAP III ST; ResMed) set at IPAP of 10 cm H 2 O and an EPAP of 4 cm H 2 O. The normalized concentration contours of air leakage distribution around the patient and mask in the median sagittal plane are shown in Figure 3A and B. We observed a vertical, coneshaped leakage plume from the mask exhalation diffuser that propagated well above and almost perpendicular to the patient. The maximum dispersion distance of smoke particles, defined as the boundary with a region encountering \u03fd 5% normalized concentration of exhaled air (light blue contour smoke concentration scale), was 0.65 m, whereas that of a high concentration (containing \u03fe 75% normalized concentration of exhaled air, red zone and above) was 0.36 m. There was no significant room contamination by exhaled air (as reflected by the blue background in the isolation room) other than the exhalation jet plume.\r\n As IPAP increased from 10 to 14 cm H 2 O, the maximum exhaled dispersion distance of the lowconcentration exhaled air was similar at 0.65 m, but that of high-concentration exhaled air increased to 0.40 m, with contamination of the isolation room, with some exhaled air concentration outside the exhalation jet plume (Fig 3C) . When IPAP was increased to 18 cm H 2 O, the dispersion distance of low-concentration exhaled air was 0.85 m, whereas that of high-concentration exhaled air increased to 0.51 m along the median sagittal plane (Fig 3D) . More background contamination of the isolation room by smoke particles was noted at higher IPAP, due to interaction between the downstream ceilingmounted ventilation vent and the upstream exhaled air from the HPS.\r\n The Image 3 mask required an additional exhalation device (Whisper Swivel; Respironics) to prevent carbon dioxide rebreathing. The exhaled air leakage was much more diffuse than that of the ComfortFull 2 mask because of the downstream leakage of exhaled air through the Whisper Swivel exhalation port. At IPAP of 10 cm H 2 O, the maximum dispersion distance of low-concentration exhaled air (light blue zone on smoke concentration scale) was 0.95 m toward the end of the bed, whereas that of mediumconcentration exhaled air (containing \u03fe 50% of normalized concentration of exhaled air, green zone and above) was about 0.6 m along the median sagittal plane (Fig 4A) . As IPAP increased from 10 to 14 cm H 2 O, the exhaled air of medium concentration increased to 0.95 m toward the end of the bed along the median sagittal plane of the HPS (Fig 4B) .\r\n When IPAP was increased to 18 cm H 2 O, the exhaled air of low concentration dispersed diffusely to fill up most of the isolation room (ie, beyond 0.95 m, as captured by the camera), whereas exhaled air of a medium concentration, occupying wider airspace, was noted to spread 0.8 m toward the end of the bed, with the accumulation of a high concentration of exhaled air (red zone on scale) within 0.34 m from the center of the mask, along the median sagittal plane of the HPS (Fig 4C) .\r\n As there is no reliable and safe marker that can be introduced into human lungs for experimental purposes, we have studied the maximum distribution of exhaled air, marked by very fine smoke particles, from the HPS during the application of NPPV using two different face masks. In this study, we have shown that the dispersion distances of a low normalized concentration of exhaled air through the Com-fortFull 2 mask exhalation diffuser increased from 0.65 to 0.85 m at a direction perpendicular to the head of the HPS along the sagittal plane when IPAP was increased from 10 to 18 cm H 2 O, respectively, with more background contamination of the isolation room at higher IPAP. In contrast, even when a low IPAP of 10 cm H 2 O was applied to the HPS via the Image 3 mask with the Whisper Swivel exhalation port, the exhaled air leaked far more diffusely than via the ComfortFull 2 mask, dispersing a low normalized concentration of 0.95 m along the median sagittal plane of the HPS, whereas a higher IPAP resulted in a wider spread of a higher normalized concentration of smoke around the HPS in the isolation room with negative pressure.\r\n NPPV is effective in the treatment of patients with respiratory failure due to COPD, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and pneumonia in immunocom-promised patients, but the evidence supporting its use in patients with pneumonia is still limited. 22 Moreover, there is a potential risk when applying NPPV in patients hospitalized with viral pneumonia. In this regard, the deliberate leakage via the exhalation ports may generate droplet nuclei and disperse infective aerosols through evaporation of water content of respiratory droplets and resulting in a superspreading event. 23 Nonetheless, NPPV has been applied to a small number of human H5N1 infections without causing any nosocomial outbreak, although the patients eventually died of multiorgan failure despite invasive mechanical ventilatory support. 24, 25 There were also anecdotal reports 26,27 that NPPV applied using a single circuit was effective in treating respiratory failure due to SARS and might reduce the need for intubation. However, a case-control study 28 involving 124 medical wards in 26 hospitals in Guangzhou and Hong Kong has identified SARS patients requiring oxygen therapy and NPPV as independent risk factors for superspread- ing nosocomial outbreaks of SARS. Similarly, a systematic review 29 has shown a strong association between ventilation, air movements in buildings, and the airborne transmission of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox, and SARS.\r\n The use of a jet nebulizer for the administration of aerosolized albuterol in an index patient on a crowded medical ward probably enhanced the spread of SARS, leading to a major nosocomial outbreak in our hospital in 2003. 9, 30 We have recently shown 12 that the maximum dispersion distance of exhaled air through the side vent of the jet nebulizer, driven by 6 L\/min air, was about 0.8 m lateral to the HPS. We have previously shown 8,11 that the maximum exhaled air distances from patients receiving oxygen via a Hudson mask and during NPPV via the Ultra Mirage mask (ResMed) were 0.4 and 0.5 m, respectively, when the HPS was programmed at very mild lung injury (Fig 5) .\r\n This study showed that the maximum exhaled air dispersion distance from the ComfortFull 2 mask was 0.95 m at a predictable direction from the exhalation diffuser perpendicular to the HPS, but leakage though the Image 3 mask, connected to the Whisper Swivel exhalation port, was far more extensive and diffuse. The Whisper Swivel is an efficient exhalation device to prevent carbon dioxide rebreathing, but it would not be advisable to use such an exhalation port in managing patients with febrile respiratory illness of unknown etiology, especially in the setting of an influenza pandemic with high human-to-human transmission potential for fear of causing major nosocomial infection. It is also important to avoid the use of higher IPAP, which could lead to wider distribution of exhaled air and substantial room contamination as demonstrated in this study. The World Health Organization interim guidelines on the prevention and control of acute respiratory diseases in health care has included NPPV among those aerosol-generating procedures in which there is a possibility of an increased risk of respiratory pathogen transmission. In addition to maintaining contact, droplet, and standard precautions among the health-care workers when providing routine care to such patients, the World Health Organization recommends 31 full personal protection equipment for the health-care workers covering the torso, arms, eyes, nose, and mouth, and this should include a long-sleeved gown, single-use gloves, eye protection, and a N95 mask or the equivalent as the minimum level of respiratory protection. NPPV should be provided in an adequately ventilated single room, and the addition of an expiratory port with a bacterial\/viral filter can reduce aerosol emission. 31 Our study was limited by the use of smoke particles as markers for exhaled air. The inertia and weight of larger droplets in an air droplet two-phase flow would certainly cause them to have less horizontal dispersion than the continuous air carrier phase in which they travel due to increased inertia and drag. However, the evaporation of water content in some droplets during NPPV may produce droplet nuclei suspended in air, whereas the larger droplets will fall to the ground in a trajectory pathway. 25 As the smoke particles in this study mark the continuous air phase, our data contours are referring to exhaled air. Our results would therefore represent the \"upper bound\" estimates for the dispersion of droplets, which would be expected to follow a shorter trajectory than the air jet due to gravitational effects but not fully reflect the risk of droplet transmis-sion. 8,10 -12 Similarly, we would expect a higher concentration of droplets closer to the floor than that estimated by our contours because of the shorter trajectory of the droplets.\r\n In summary, substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within 1 m from patients receiving NPPV in an isolation room with negative pressure via the ComfortFull 2 mask and the Image 3 mask connected to the Whisper Swivel exhalation port, with far more extensive leakage and room contamination via the latter device, especially at higher IPAP. Health-care workers should take adequate precautions when providing NPPV support to patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology complicated by respiratory failure. Figure 5 .

Its in-hospital mortality rate is 41.1%, placing a large burden on public health. 1, 2 Th e most common underlying causes of ARDS include pulmonary risk factors, such as pneumonia or pulmonary contusion, and nonpulmonary risk factors, including sepsis, burn, severe trauma, and multiple transfusions. 3 Studies have focused on the role of genetics in ARDS pathophysiology and have identifi ed dozens of loci related to ARDS outcome (eg, IL1RN [IL1 receptor antagonist], ANGPT2 [angiopoietin -2] , PI3 [peptidase inhibitor 3] , and PPFIA1 [protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, f polypeptide]). [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] However, the roles of genetic susceptibility and its interactions with microenvironmental factors remain incomplete. 9, 10 Platelets are believed to make an important contribution to pulmonary-origin ARDS among critically ill patients acting in conjunction with fi brinogen to mediate endothelial damage through multiple signal transduction pathways. 11, 12 Indeed, if patients with ARDS develop thrombocytopenia or systemic coagulation disorders, such as platelet consumption and\/or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), they are at increased risk for a poor prognosis. 13 Genetic factors contributing to platelet count (PLT) are beginning to be uncovered. In particular, a meta-analysis of seven genome-wide association studies of 16,388 individuals from seven\r\n Th e study was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard School of Public Health (project approval number: 1999P0086071\/MGH). All participants or their surrogate care providers gave written informed consent.\r\n ARDS cases and control subjects were identified from critically ill patients from the ICU at MGH as described previously. 5 Briefl y, we screened each ICU admission for eligible subjects, who were defi ned as critically ill patients with at least one predisposing condition for ARDS: (1) sepsis, (2) septic shock, (3) trauma, (4) pneumonia, (5) aspiration, or (6) massive transfusion of packed RBCs (defi ned as . 8 packed RBC units during the 24 h before admission) and without any of the exclusion criteria (age , 18 years, diff use alveolar hemorrhage, chronic lung diseases other than COPD or asthma, directive to withhold intubation, immunosuppression not secondary to corticosteroid, and treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor). Aft er enrollment, subjects were followed daily for the development of ARDS, as defi ned by the American-European Consensus Committee. 18, 19 Control subjects were identifi ed as at-risk patients who did not meet criteria for ARDS during the ICU stay and had no prior history of ARDS. Patient demographic and baseline clinical characteristics including sepsis, pneumonia, trauma, transfusion, and PLT were collected at ICU admission.\r\n Genotyping DNA was extracted from peripheral WBCs using the protocols as described previously. 20 Subjects were genotyped using the Infi nium HumanExome BeadChip (Illumina, Inc). Before analysis, a systematic quality evaluation was conducted on the raw genotyping data according to the general quality control (QC) procedure described by Anderson and colleagues. 21 Briefl y, unqualifi ed samples were excluded if they fi t the following QC criteria: (1) overall genotype completion rates , 95%, (2) sex discrepancies, (3) unexpected duplicates or probable relatives (based on pairwise identity by state value, PI_HAT in PLINK . 0.185), or (4) heterozygosity rates more than six times the SD from the mean. Unqualifi ed SNPs were excluded when they fi t the following QC criteria: (1) SNPs had a call rate , 95% in all samples, (2) the genotype distri butions of SNPs deviated from those expected by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( P , .000001), or (3) SNPs were too rare to detect variants under our sample size. Aft er quality evaluation, 629 ARDS cases and 1,026 at-risk control subjects and 19 SNPs were included in the initial analyses.\r\n A validation study of genome-wide gene expression profi les were generated from total RNA samples extracted from peripheral blood collected at ICU admission of 18 at-risk control subjects from the MGH ARDS study cohort. Protocols for sample collection and processing, whole \r\n population-based cohorts identifi ed fi ve quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with PLT: BAD at 11q13, LRRC16A at 6p22, CD36 at 7q11, JMJD1C at 10q21, and SLMO2 at 20q13. 14 Although the identifi cation of these loci provides a foundation for understanding the genetic contributions to PLT, no studies have yet examined the role of PLT-associated loci in ARDS pathophysiology.\r\n Our hypothesis is that PLT may act as an important causal mediator of genetic eff ect on ARDS development. In causal inference, the mediation modeling is a rigorous approach to identify and explain the mechanism by which an independent variable (eg, genetic variant) aff ects the outcome (eg, ARDS risk) via a third explanatory variable, known as a mediator variable (eg, PLT) ( Fig 1 ) . Th is approach has been successfully applied in research on several lung diseases. [15] [16] [17] Using exome-wide genotyping data (Illumina ExomeChip), in this study we validated QTLs of PLT within fi ve candidate genes-BAD , LRRC16A , CD36 , JMJD1C , and SLMO2 -among critically ill patients. We further evaluated the fi ndings by independent gene expression experimental data. Finally, we explored the eff ect of these genetic variants on ARDS risk and whether their eff ects are causally mediated through PLT. blood total RNA extraction, and quality assessment were described previously. 22 RNA samples were hybridized to Aff ymetrix Hu133A 2.0 GeneChips (Aff ymetrix, Inc). Expression values for four probe sets within LRRC16A were extracted, normalized, and log 2 -transformed using dChip soft ware. 23 Th ree probe sets were excluded from the analysis because they had absent calls in . 50% of samples. Only one probe set of LRRC16A (230793_at) was included in the analysis.\r\n Baseline characteristics including demographics and baseline measurements are described as mean \u03ee SD (minimum, maximum) for continuous variables and number (%) for categorical variables. Th e Student t test or Fisher exact test were used for comparisons between groups for continuous or categorical variables, respectively. All SNPs were encoded at additive genetic format (0: wild type; 1: heterozygosity; 2: homozygosity, minor allele as eff ect allele). Th is study included three main scenarios of analyses in the predefi ned order of (1) QTL analysis of PLT, (2) ARDS risk analysis of SNP variants, and (3) causal inference analysis. Th e sequential testing strategy-borrowed from serial gatekeeping procedure-was used, in which the analysis would move forward only if the previous one reached a reasonable signifi cance. [24] [25] [26] Th is strategy is broadly used to control for family-wise type 1 error in clinical trials with multiple comparisons that have a predefi ned sequence. All models were adjusted for covariates of age, sex, sepsis, and pneumonia at admission, unless stated otherwise.\r\n Th e Sequence Kernel Association Test was used for gene-based QTL analysis. 27 Th e log 2 -transformed gene expression was further standardized as z score ( z ) for QTL analysis using linear regression. Th e results are indicated by the b coeffi cient (explained by the change of PLT per 1 SD increase of log 2 -transformed expression level) and the 95% CI. For SNP-level QTL analysis, linear regression was used for analyzing of fi ve common SNPs, respectively. Th e results are indicated by b coefficient (the change of PLT per eff ect allele of SNP) and the 95% CI. Th e SNP with false discovery rate (described as q -value) , .10 was selected for ARDS risk analysis. Only one SNP (rs7766874) reached the criteria. Th e proportion of PLT variance explained by the SNP rs7766874 was estimated using analysis of variance as the ratio of the sum of squares of SNP (SS SNP ) to the sum of squares total (SS Total ).\r\n For ARDS risk analysis, the association of SNP, PLT, and the interaction with ARDS risk were evaluated by logistic regression and are described by OR (the exponential function of the coeffi cient) and the 95% CI :\r\n where u SNP , u PLT , and u Interaction represent the coeffi cients of SNP, PLT, and SNP-PLT interaction, respectively; B is a vector of coeffi cients of covariates. Th e analysis would move forward if the statistical P value of u SNP or u Interaction test , .05.\r\n For causal inference analysis, the VanderWeele mediation model was applied to evaluate the causal indirect eff ect of a SNP that was mediated through PLT. 17 Th e results are described by indirect OR ( OR Indirect , per eff ect allele of SNP) and the 95% CI:\r\n where b SNP was estimated by the following weighted linear regression model of PLT on SNP:\r\n In model (3), the weights ( w ) were calculated for cases or control subjects, respectively: (4)\r\n where the prevalence represents the prevalence of ARDS among the at-risk critically ill population, and r represents the proportion of ARDS cases in the analytical dataset. Bootstrapping with 1,000 replications was used to estimate the 95% CI of OR Indirect and statistical signifi cance. Th e Imai causal inference method was also used with the same weights for cross-validation with the VanderWeele mediation model. 28 The statistical signifi cance level was 0.05. All analyses were performed using R statistical soft ware, v 2.15.1 (Th e R Foundation ).\r\n Th e distributions of demographic and clinical characteristics at ICU admission among 629 patients with ARDS and 1,026 at-risk control subjects are described in Table 1 .\r\n All the control subjects and 97.77% of the ARDS cases were white. No signifi cant diff erences were observed in age or sex distributions between ARDS and at-risk control groups. PLT and number of subjects with sepsis or pneumonia (as risk factors for ARDS) were signifi cantly diff erent between cases and control subjects.\r\n Since the design of the Illumina ExomeChip focuses on functional exonic SNPs, most of the covered SNPs are either low-frequent or rare alleles (minor allele frequency [MAF] , 0.05). 29 No SNPs were mapped within BAD , CD36 , or SLMO2 . Two rare SNPs were mapped within JMJD1C ; these were excluded from further analysis to ensure adequate statistical power. Th e 17 SNPs identifi ed within LRRC16A were included in the analysis ( Table 2 ) . Th e analysis workfl ow is described in Figure 2 .\r\n We initially conducted a gene-based QTL analysis of PLT on LRRC16A genetic variants ( Table 3 ) . Five common SNPs (MAF \u0546 0.05) showed a signifi cant joint association with PLT among at-risk control subjects ( P 5 .036). We validated this fi nding by using independent whole-genome gene expression data from 18 at-risk control subjects. A linear regression model detected a signifi cant association between LRRC16A expression level and PLT ( b 5 77.03 per 1 SD increase of expression level; 95% CI, 27.26-126.80; P 5 .005) ( Fig 3 ) . Aft er adjustment for common covariates including age, sex, sepsis, and pneumonia using stepwise regression, the association remained signifi cant ( P 5 .011).\r\n We then performed a single SNP QTL analysis for each common SNP within LRRC16A ( Table 4 ) . Only SNP rs7766874 was signifi cantly associated with PLT among at-risk control subjects ( b 5 2 13.00 per eff ect allele of SNP; 95% CI, 2 23.22 to 2 2.77; P 5 .013; false discovery rate adjusted q -value 5 .065), which explained around 1% of PLT variance. To evaluate more potential confounders, we did a sensitivity analysis with adjustment for all covariates in Table 1 Because SNP rs7766874 was a signifi cant QTL marker of PLT ( Table 4 ) , and was associated with ARDS risk by interacting with PLT ( Table 5 ), PLT may act as an important causal mediator of the genetic effect of LRRC16A on ARDS outcome. To test this hypothesis, we performed a causal inference test using mediation analysis. Based on previously reported studies [31] [32] [33] and considering that our cases were all Berlin moderate or severe ARDS, 30 the ARDS prevalence among the at-risk population was set as 5%; this was in turn used to calculate the weights for mediation analysis. Signifi cant causal indirect eff ect was detected for SNP rs7766874 on the increased risk of ARDS that was mediated through PLT (VanderWeele method, OR Indirect 5 1.045 per eff ect allele; 95% CI, 1.007-1.085; P 5 .021) ( Table 6 ) . Signifi cance was confi rmed by the Imai method ( P 5 .038) ( Table 6 ) . We also performed two sensitivity analyses that excluded the control subjects who could be reclassifi ed as patients with ALI or excluded the ARDS cases who were diagnosed on the day of ICU admission. Consistently significant or borderline signifi cant associations were observed ( Table 6 ). To evaluate the impact of diff erent ARDS prevalence on our results, we set the ARDS prevalence at 10% or 15% for further sensitivity analyses; these results were consistent with that at 5% ARDS prevalence ( Table 6 ).\r\n Genetic variants within LRRC16A were previously reported to be associated with PLT among relatively healthy African American populations. 14 In this study, we replicated these results by validating the association between a common intronic SNP (rs7766874, G allele frequency 5 47.59%) within LRRC16A and PLT in a white population of 1,655 critically ill patients. Th e SNP rs7766874 showed limited population diversity in the National Center for Biotechnology Information dbSNP database (G allele frequency in African American 5 51%). Interestingly, among ARDS cases and at-risk control subjects, the association was inconsistent. Th e mechanisms for this are not well understood. It is possible that LRRC16A plays a diff erent role in at-risk control subjects vs ARDS cases and needs to be further studied. In this study, we demonstrate strong evidence that a low platelet count contributes to a higher risk of ARDS. A low PLT could be caused by thrombocytopenia or DIC; both are common complications among critically ill patients and are independent risk factors aff ecting prognosis. [34] [35] [36] [37] However, we could not rule out the role of low platelets in ARDS pathophysiology from platelets consumption in DIC.\r\n Notably, our results suggest that LRRC16A plays an important role in ARDS risk mediating through PLT. Th e indirect hazard eff ect of SNP rs7766874 on ARDS risk may be explained because SNP rs7766874 causes a Regression coeffi cient and its 95% CI, representing the change in PLT per eff ect allele. c q represents adjusted P value by false discovery rate method. P 5 .231, also known as total eff ect in mediation analysis). It is possible to have a signifi cant indirect eff ect in the absence of total eff ect. 38, 39 Th is can be explained by the presence of several mediating paths (multiple potential mediators) that confl ict with each other and become noticeable when one of the cancelling mediators is controlled for. Th us, the indirect eff ect identifi ed in our study is a \"partial\" mediation eff ect. However, this mechanism needs to be better understood through well-controlled experiments. Also the interaction between LRRC16A and PLT implies that LRRC16A has eff ect beyond platelet count but also on function and, in turn, on ARDS risk. Extensive evidence demonstrates a role of platelet function in increased morbidity and mortality among patients in the ICU, [40] [41] [42] [43] whereas the precise mechanism of how the genetic variants impact platelets and in turn aff ect ARDS risk requires further studies of functional genomics.\r\n LRRC16A encodes capping protein ARP2\/3 and myosin-I linker (CARMIL), a cytoskeletal scaff old protein that binds CAPZA2 (capping protein muscle Z-line a 2), with high affi nity and signifi cantly decreases the affi nity of CAPZA2 for actin barbed ends. 44 CAPZA2 is the b subunit of the barbed-end actin binding protein, the heterodimeric actin-capping protein that blocks actin fi lament (F-actin) assembly and disassembly at the fastgrowing (barbed) fi lament ends and functions in regulating actin fi lament dynamics as well as in stabilizing actin fi laments. Actin-based cellular processes are essential for end-amplifi cation of proplatelet processes during megakaryocyte maturation. 45, 46 Th e intronic SNP rs7766874 may be in linkage disequilibrium with latent functional variants that alter the activity of CARMIL and thereby result in abnormal megakaryocyte matura-tion and altered platelet formation. Interestingly, platelets contain actin-binding proteins that can bind to and shorten actin fi laments. [47] [48] [49] [50] Moreover, F-actin acts as a key step in ARDS induced by systemic infl ammatory response syndrome via increased blood neutrophil adhesion and migration and by the production of infl ammatory factors. 51 An alternative postulated mechanism of LRRC16A on ARDS is platelet independent that the variant LRRC16A prevents actin polymerization , which impacts the alveolar capillary barrier function. 52 We acknowledge some limitations in our study. Th e Illumina ExomeChip includes a high percentage of low-frequent alleles. Our study was limited in power to study the association of these low-frequent functional SNPs with ARDS outcome. Additionally, further investigation is needed to evaluate the mechanisms that underlie the mediation of platelets in the association between LRRC16A genetic variants and risk of ARDS.\r\n Considering the heterogeneity and various manifestations of ARDS, these study results should be examined in even larger samples to evaluate our fi ndings among specifi c subgroups. Another limitation is that the attribution of causality is solely based on the results of mediation analysis, which requires follow-up well-designed functional studies.\r\n In summary, we validated LRRC16A as associated with platelet count among critically ill patients. Our fi ndings suggest that LRRC16A plays an important role in ARDS pathophysiology by interacting with and being causally mediated through platelets.","sha":"bb37289058a4161e7e46c8066982d37cb95add6a","publish_time":"2015-03-01","authors":"Wei, Yongyue; Wang, Zhaoxi; Su, Li; Chen, Feng; Tejera, Paula; Bajwa, Ednan K.; Wurfel, Mark M.; Lin, Xihong; Christiani, David C.","journal":"Chest","doi":"10.1378\/chest.14-1246","Title":"Chest","H index":267.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"[ 1 4 7 # 3 C H E S T M A R C H 2 0 1 5 ] ARDS is characterized by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates.

Respiratory infections have a relatively limited repertoire of clinical manifestations, so that there is often nothing characteristic enough about a specific infection to make the diagnosis obvious. Thus, the pathway to the diagnosis of infections that are not endemic in a region relies heavily on taking a thorough history of both itinerary and of specific exposures. One important caveat is that on occasion, the history of a recent trip creates an element of \"tunnel vision\" in the evaluating health-care provider. It is tempting to relate a person's problem to that recent trip; however, when evaluating recent returnees, it is always important to remember that the travel may have nothing to do with the patient's presentation. Recent travel may add diagnostic considerations to the list of possibilities, but an astute clinician must not disregard the possibility that the patient's illness has nothing to do with the recent trip. (CHEST 2008; 134:163-171) ","text_body":"R espiratory tract infections are among the most common causes of medical problems that physicians manage. Recent foreign and domestic travel can add additional diagnostic considerations to the list of likely possibilities. Transportation is rapid enough that it can exceed the incubation period of many illnesses, so that patients might initially present after returning to health-care providers who are not accustomed to dealing with them. An outbreak of coccidioidomycosis in Washington State in a church group recently returned from Mexico is an example. 1 A number of reviews have noted that respiratory infections are common in international travelers, accounting for up to 25% of the febrile illness that health-care workers are asked to evaluate. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Table 1 shows important diagnostic possibilities based on the region of the world traveled that should be added to the local possibilities for returning travelers with respiratory problems. Each will be discussed in this review. Not only is the region of the world important, but any specifics of exposure might be the clue to trigger appropriate diagnostic tests and treatment. Table 2 list some specific exposures to consider in the history. outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the Far East was associated with aircraft transmission. 7 In May 2007, a person with possible extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis was quarantined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) after air travel. Events such as these alert the public to infectious disease transmission on planes. Accurate data about the infectious risks of air travel are limited, and therefore this risk is difficult to quantify. Published reports of such transmission are rare. There were 120 people, 1 of whom with symptomatic SARS, on a Boeing 737-300 traveling from Hong Kong to Beijing. Laboratory-confirmed SARS developed in 16 passengers, and 6 others possibly were infected. Passengers with infection were clustered in a few rows directly in front of or behind the ill passenger. 8 Despite this outbreak the risk is low. By May 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) reviewed information on 35 flights in which a patient with symptomatic SARS had been onboard. Only four flights appeared to be associated with possible transmission. 9 Vogt et al 10 found no transmission on seven international flights carrying SARS patients. In May 2003, the WHO issued guidelines for the containment of in-flight SARS. 11 Tuberculosis has also been transmitted on aircraft, and like SARS the risk appears to be very small. 12, 13 Since screening for active tuberculosis is not required for most air travelers, persons with active disease may travel on commercial aircraft without being aware of their contagion. From 1992 to 1994, the CDC investigated seven flights that carried persons with highly active tuberculosis. There was evidence of transmission on three of the flights (one case was from a flight attendant to other crew members). As with SARS, the risk was related to the proximity to the index patient. 14 However, despite intensive investigation, these seven exposures to active tuberculosis on aircraft resulted in few new tuberculous infections and no tuberculous disease. Air travel represents a negligible risk factor for the acquisition of tuberculosis. 15 Aircraft have been a great concern as a potential vector for the global spread of influenza. Air travel has resulted in international outbreaks of influenza and will likely be a major vector when the next pandemic occurs. 16 -18 However, during an epidemic, actual transmission of influenza during flight is much less of a health concern.\r\n Although a worry of the traveling public, \"common cold\" outbreaks related to airplane transmission have not been reported. A study 19 that compared the risks for an upper respiratory tract infection developing during air travel in 50% recirculated vs 100% fresh cabin air noted no difference in the two groups.\r\n Environmental control measures on commercial aircraft have recently been reviewed by Mangili and Gendreau. 20 While an aircraft is parked at the gate with the engines off, passenger cabin ventilation is normally supplied by the air conditioning system and the natural airflow through the open door(s) of the aircraft. During flight, the aircraft cabin has systems that control air exchanges. At cruising altitude, outside ambient air is virtually free of microorganisms. Air enters the cabin from overhead vents and flows downwards toward the outflow grills along both side walls of the cabin near the floor. Air enters and leaves the cabin at approximately the same row; airflow along the length of the cabin is minimal. All commercial jet aircraft built after the late 1980s recirculate the cabin air: from 10 to 50% of the cabin air is filtered, mixed with outside, and then reintroduced into the passenger cabin. On most aircraft, the recirculated air passes through high-efficiency particulate air filters before reentering the passenger cabin. The most efficient high-efficiency particulate air filters will remove 99.99% of particles (bacteria, fungi, and larger viruses). 21 All large commercial jet aircraft provide approximately 20 air exchanges per hour during cruising. This can be compared to that of the standard modern office building that averages 12 exchanges per hour. The concentration of microorganisms in cabin air is much lower than shopping malls and the air terminal. 22 There is no evidence that recirculation of cabin air facilitates transmission of infectious disease agents on board, and the mechanisms described above to manage air flow should make risks minimal for passengers other than those sitting within close proximity to an index patient. 23 However, when the aircraft is delayed on the ground and the doors are closed, the ventilation system should be operating. An influenza outbreak associated with an airplane flight resulted when a ground delay lasted 3 h, during which the ventilation system did not operate and the passengers did not receive outside air. 18 Thus, although inflight risks are minimal, ground delays without adequate ventilation could be a problem. According to a study by the US Department of Transportation: \"If the ventilation system is not operating, passengers should not stay aboard the plane for long time periods (ie, \u03fe 30 min).\" 24 Overall, airplane travel appears to represent a low risk of acquiring a respiratory infection. This risk is probably not out of line with other situations in which people are in close proximity to each other, such as office buildings and theaters. This risk is a function of the contagion and proximity to the index case and the duration of the flight. This risk is also related to the efficacy of the cabin ventilation system. Properly functioning systems are probably very effective at decreasing this risk; however, when systems are not working, such as when passengers are kept aboard grounded aircraft, outbreaks are facilitated.\r\n Cruise ships have also been associated with outbreaks of respiratory diseases, particularly Legionnaires disease. 25, 26 As with land-associated outbreaks, those aboard ship have been linked to contaminated water sources. Given the nature of the prolonged exposure on cruises, it is not surprising that outbreaks of influenza have also been reported. 27 Specific Respiratory Diseases To Consider in a Returning Traveler\r\n Although tuberculosis rarely presents acutely, it can; and this is such an important disease worldwide that it deserves some brief mention here. Primary tuberculosis most commonly has a lowerlobe presentation and can be indistinguishable clinically from other causes of pneumonia. There are few data on the actual risk for a traveler. 28 In a Dutch study 29 of 656 young adults who traveled to areas of the world with high tuberculosis endemicity, the overall risk of skin test conversion was 3.5 per 1,000 person-months. In our ongoing study of medical personnel working in a hospital in Botswana where 80% of the patients are infected with tuberculosis, we have found a rate of skin test conversion of 42\/1,000 person-months (Z. Szep, MD; personal communication; December 20, 2007) . Any traveler who returns from an area of high incidence of tuberculosis to an area of low incidence should be tested for latent tuberculosis. 30 \r\n There is an extensive literature on travel-related outbreaks associated with cruise ships; however, a number other sources of travel-related outbreaks have been reported. 31, 32 According to the CDC, 20% of patients hospitalized with Legionnaires disease in the United States acquired their infection while traveling. 33 Pneumonia is the major clinical manifestation of infection with Legionella pneumophila. The onset tends to be subacute. Respiratory symptoms may not be initially prominent. Although accompanying GI symptoms and hyponatremia might be more prominent with Legionella pneumonia, there are no clinical, radiologic, or initial laboratory features that allow one to reliably distinguish this from other causes of lobar pneumonia. 34, 35 There are several options for diagnosis. Testing for urinary antigen can be done in hours, and is very specific if the infection is with L pneumophila serogroup I, which accounts for 80% of the cases. It will not identify any of the other Legionella species or serogroups. Culture on selective media is also very specific but takes several days and has a relatively low sensitivity. Serology can only confirm the diagnosis after recovery. Most patients should have sputum sent for urinary antigen testing and culture. Treatment should be with a newer macrolide or a quinolone. In resource-poor settings, erythromycin plus rifampin can be used.\r\n Burkholderia pseudomallei is distributed throughout most of the world but is endemic in parts of China, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Subclinical infection is common in endemic areas. Risk factors for clinical disease include diabetes, chronic alcoholism, chronic lung disease, and chronic renal disease. 36 Most disease is pulmonary, although bacteremic spread can involve virtually any organ. Pulmonary syndromes include acute pneumonia, chronic pneumonia, and latent pulmonary infection with reactivation. Latent infection can clinically manifest many years after initial exposure. Acute pneumonia has an incubation period of days and has a presentation with fever, productive cough, rigors, and dyspnea that is similar to other bacterial pneumonias. 37 Both subacute pneumonia and reactivation pneumonia are clinically indistinguishable from tuberculosis and some fungal pneumonias manifesting fever, night sweats, productive cough, and hemoptysis. Chest radiographic appearance can vary widely depending on the pulmonary syndrome. In acute pneumonia military nodules, lobar or multilobar consolidation and pleural effusions can be seen. As the disease progresses, cavitation can occur. In chronic melioidosis, infiltrates may be cavitating, nodular, or linear and fibrotic mimicking tuberculosis. The diagnosis of melioidosis is established by culture of sputum and\/or blood. B pseudomallei is resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, aminoglycosides, and first-or second-generation cephalosporins. Recommended antibiotics include ceftazidine or carbapenems. In severe infections, many would add trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. In resource-poor, settings chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole have been used. Initial IV therapy should be given for 2 to 8 weeks depending on the severity of the illness, and then oral therapy with high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent relapse should be continued for at least 3 months. 38 Plague Yersinia pestis is widely distributed in the world. It is particularly prevalent in the developing world. In the United States, there is an endemic pocket in the Southwest. Worldwide, the major reservoir is the rat, although in the United States it is the prairie dog. The flea is the vector for transmission from animals. In addition to bubonic and septicemia syndromes, pneumonia can be a manifestation. After a relatively brief incubation period of 2 to 7 days, fever, productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, and often hemoptysis develop. The disease progresses rapidly with cavitation common. Plague pneumonia is not reliably distinguishable from other causes of rapidly progres-sive necrotizing pneumonia on clinical grounds alone. 39 The diagnosis is confirmed by isolating Y pestis from sputum, blood, and\/or an aspirate of an enlarged lymph node. Up to 40% of patients have the organism visible on peripheral blood smear. The sputum is highly contagious, and patients should be in strict isolation for the first 48 h of therapy. Treatment needs to be initiated quickly. The traditional medication has been streptomycin. However, a number of other drugs have been shown to have in vitro activity and clinical success, including tetracyclines and gentamicin. 40 Postexposure prophylaxis with tetracycline, doxycycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should be administered to all persons with close contact. 41 Tularemia Francisella tularensis is only found in the northern hemisphere. Reservoirs are rabbits and small rodents, and the vectors are several different hemophagic arthropods. Pneumonia, one of a number of clinical presentations, begins abruptly after a severalday incubation period. The cough is typically nonproductive. Chest radiographs reveal lobar consolidations, sometimes with hilar adenopathy and pleural effusions. 42 The organism can be isolated from sputum and blood but will not grow on standard media, and it represents a transmission risk for laboratory workers. Although the clinical syndrome is not unique, recognition is greatly facilitated by obtaining a potential exposure history related to outdoor activity. Diagnosis is usually confirmed serologically. Treatment options include streptomycin, gentimicin, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol. 43 \r\n New-world hantaviruses such as the Sin Nombre virus, found primarily in the Southwest United States, and strains found in Central and South America cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). 44 Old-world hantaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. All medically important hantaviruses have rodent reservoirs. Although person-to-person transmission has been described, most transmission to humans occurs via aerosolization in buildings with heavy rodent infestations. 45 HPS has clinical features that along with a potential exposure history should make it a strong consideration. The incubation period can be relatively long, lasting 1 to 4 weeks before the onset of initial symptoms of a \"typical\" viral syndrome with fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and myalgias; respiratory symptoms are generally at presentation. After several days, the abrupt onset of severe tachypnea and dry cough indicates noncardiogenic pulmonary edema due to severe capillary leak into the lungs. This stage lasts 24 to 48 h and ends with either death in 50% of those infected or a rapid recovery. In addition to the exposure and characteristic clinic history, clues that suggest the diagnosis include thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, and circulating immunoblasts. 46 Diagnosis can be confirmed serologically or by polymerase chain reaction on blood. Treatment is supportive. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has also been successfully used to sustain patients through the capillary leak part of the illness. 47 No antiviral treatment is presently recommended.\r\n There are a number of viruses that can produce a hemorrhagic fever syndrome. These include yellow fever, dengue, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Marburg, and Ebola. Dengue is widespread throughout the developing world, and yellow fever is endemic in periequatorial Africa and South America, while the others tend to occur in localized outbreaks primarily in Africa. Incubation period is 1 to 2 weeks. The initial presentations are typical of a viral illness with fever, headache, and myalgias. Pulmonary manifestations are seen and are due to ARDS. These viral infections are diagnosed serologically, and treatment is supportive.\r\n Travelers are often in close contact with relatively large numbers of individuals in hotels, airport terminals, ships, and other destinations where tourists congregate. This increases the possibility of exposure to influenza and other respiratory pathogens. In 2003, the Haji pilgrimage was associated with an estimated 24,000 cases of influenza. 48 Influenza is typically a winter-time disease in the temperate regions of both the northern and southern hemispheres, but it circulates throughout the year in equatorial regions. Both the Canadian Committee to Advise on Tropical Medicine and Travel and the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommend influenza vaccination for a traveler going to the southern hemisphere from April through September and at any time of year when in tour groups if the traveler has not been vaccinated in the previous year. A potential problem with this recommendation is the lack of available vaccine in the \"off\" season in the northern hemisphere. It is reasonable to consider giving a traveler a treatment dose of oseltamivir to carry if they have been inadequately vaccinated and are in a risk group for severe disease. In addition to this background concern the emergence of Avian influenza (H5N1) in Asia in 2003 has further height-ened concerns. Avian influenza is now a firmly established zoonosis in birds in many countries. The risk to humans involves close exposure to poultry; human-to-human transmission remains very uncommon at this time. The WHO does not suggest travel restrictions based on concerns about avian influenza but does suggest avoidance of poultry farms and markets in countries affected by avian influenza. The CDC has offered similar guidelines. 49, 50 Additional recommendations regarding travel and avian influenza are listed in Table 3 .\r\n Several species of the fluke, paragonimus, are distributed throughout the world. Most human infections are associated with the Far East and are due to Paragonimus westermani. Human infection occurs after the ingestion of undercooked fresh-water crabs or crayfish. After ingestion, the acute larval migratory phase lasts 4 to 8 weeks, and symptoms include abdominal discomfort, pleuritic chest pain, and nonproductive cough. Fever and hemoptysis are rare. Radiologic findings can include pleural effusions and migratory parenchymal infiltrates. 51 Important laboratory clues include eosinophilic pleural fluid and a marked peripheral eosinophilia. After several months, the larva develop into adult flukes and most infections then become asymptomatic. When chronic symptoms occur, the most common are recurrent hemoptysis and pleuritic chest pain. Eosinophilia is no longer present. This can last for many years. The differential diagnostic concerns for chronic paragonimiasis are principally tuberculosis and malignancy. 52, 53 During the acute larval migratory phase before adult worms have developed to produce eggs, the diagnosis of paragonimiasis is primarily clinical. After about 2 months, identification of the ova in the sputum or feces confirms infection. Serologic testing is also available. Treatment is highly effective with a 2-day course of praziquantel, 54,55 but triclabendazole (available through the CDC) appears to be as effective or better tolerated. \r\n Pulmonary manifestations of schistosomiasis are uncommon and, if present, generally occur early in the illness as part of the Katayama fever syndrome. 56 Fresh-water swimming in endemic areas of South America, Africa, and Asia exposes the patient to the larva that penetrate the skin. During the initial 2 to 6 weeks of infection, some persons have a hypersensitivity reaction characterized by fever, arthralgias, myalgias, headache, generalized adenopathy, and pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia. Nodular infiltrates seem to be particularly common. 57 The diagnosis of Katayama fever is based on an appropriate exposure history and consistent clinical findings. As with paragonimus, it is too early in the infection for eggs to be detectable in the stool. There is no specific treatment for acute pulmonary schistosomiasis. The benefit of praziquantel for acute schistosomiasis is controversial because it only has efficacy against the adult worms. If praziquantel is used for acute infection, it should be administered at about 8 weeks when the adult worms have developed. Corticosteroids are often prescribed to lessen symptoms. 56 -58 Intestinal Nematodes Strongyloides (Strongyloides stercoralis), ascaris (Ascaris lumbricoides) and occasionally hookworm (Necator americanus and Ancelostema duodenale) can all produce a syndrome of pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia during the larval migratory phase (Loeffler syndrome). Patients complain of a nonproductive, blood-tinged cough plus dyspnea and occasionally fever. During larval migration, the stool is generally negative, although larva can be identified in sputum specimens. Eosinophils and Charcot Leyden crystals in the sputum should suggest the diagnosis in a recent traveler. The pulmonary syndrome is generally self-limited; however, the infection should be treated. Strongyloides are treated with ivermectin. Ascaris and hookworm are treated with mebendazole. Tropical eosinophilia is a related syndrome, although a more serious disease due to a hypersensitivity reaction and the larval migration of microfilaria. The vector for the filaria is the mosquito, and it can found throughout the tropics, especially India. Diagnostic clues are a very high blood eosinophilia and high IgE levels. Elevations of filarial antibodies support the diagnosis. 59 Diethylcarbamazine has some efficacy, especially when administered early in the infection, but progressive interstitial fibrosis can result even if treated. A number of parasites are associated with the syndrome of pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia. They are listed in Table 4 .\r\n Histoplasmosis is a fungus that is found throughout the world. It is particularly endemic in the Midwestern United States in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys. Exposure history often involves soil that has been enriched with bird or bat droppings. Most infections are asymptomatic, but when symptomatic pulmonary disease is the most common manifestation. Mild disease appears as a subacute \"flu-like\" illness 2 to 4 weeks after exposure with nonproductive cough, myalgias, and fever. Chest radiograph reveals pulmonary infiltrates and hilar or mediastinal adenopathy. In most cases, the symptoms resolve without treatment over several weeks, but a sustained period of asthenia is not unusual. Antifungal therapy is generally not needed in these patients. This form of pulmonary histoplasmosis is not distinctive enough to be able to distinguish it on clinical grounds from other atypical pneumonias; the clue should be in eliciting an exposure history such as working with soil (cleaning a chicken coop) or spelunking in the weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. Heavy exposure results in a much more severe illness after an incubation period of a week. Patients can be severely dyspneic and can progress to respiratory failure. Chest radiographs have a military pattern. There are a number of modalities available for diagnosing acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. The sensitivity of the tests varies with the severity of the syndrome. In mild disease, sputum smear and culture results are rarely positive; urinary antigen testing is better but still only positive in up to 25 to 75% of infected persons, increasing in sensitivity with the severity of the illness. Antibody testing is the most sensitive, although it usually takes at least 4 weeks for antibodies to be detected. 60 If the patient undergoes BAL, the fluid can also be tested for antigen and stained for histoplasma. Culture of this fluid and\/or biopsy material has the highest yield but can take several weeks to become positive. Since most acute pulmonary disease is mild and self-limited, most persons do not need treatment. Treatment is generally indicated in severe disease (hypoxia) and in 61, 62 suggest excellent activity, there is not enough human experience with posaconazole or voriconazole to recommend them and echinocandins should not be used. Steroid therapy is generally indicated when using antifungals to treat histoplasmosis; their use is associated with a rapid clinical improvement and allows a quicker transition to itraconazole. Treatment should be continued for 2 to 3 months.\r\n Coccidioides immitis is endemic in the soil of the arid regions of the Western Hemisphere (not just the US southwest). Most infections are subclinical, with acute disease occurring with an incubation period of 1 to 4 weeks in less than one half of those infected. 63 The syndrome is that of an atypical pneumonia with fever, nonproductive cough, myalgias, chest pain, and headache (Valley fever). Erythema nodosum is seen in approximately 10% of cases, and when present is a helpful clue to distinguish coccidioides infection from other causes of community-acquired pneumonia. Erythema multiforme is also associated with infection with this organism. The only unusual laboratory marker is an eosinophilia seen in approximately one fourth of cases. Chest radiographic findings can be normal or may show infiltrates with associated hilar adenopathy. These may result in residual nodules and\/or thin-walled cavities. Symptoms resolve in most patients in 2 to 3 months without treatment. Particularly severe infections or infections in persons with impaired cell-mediated immunity often show pulmonary progression and\/or dissemination and should be treated. In addition, pregnant women, diabetics, and persons of African or Philippine origin are more likely to have complications. Diagnosis is generally made serologically, although the organism can be isolated from respiratory secretions and coccidioides spherules can occasionally be seen in sputum. When treatment is necessary, imidazoles and amphotericin are used. 64 -66 Q Fever Coxiella burnetti is found throughout the world. Infection with this organism can produce a number of different syndromes, but one of the more commonly diagnosed is pneumonia. The incubation period is relatively long, 2 to 6 weeks. Pneumonia in Q fever is clinically indistinguishable from other atypical pneumonias with fever, a nonproductive cough, and interstitial infiltrates. The disease is generally mild, although severe cases can occur with about a 1% mortality. 67 Exposure history involves sheep and goats, especially around the time of delivery. A normal leukocyte count is the rule, and thrombocytopenia is frequently seen. Moderately elevated transaminase levels are seen in most patients. 68 The diagnosis is confirmed serologically, and standard treatment is with a tetracycline for 2 weeks, although macrolides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and floroquinones all are of benefit. \u2424-Lactam antibiotics should not be used.\r\n Chlamydophila psittaci (formerly Chlamydia) is found throughout the world, and most infected persons have a history of contact with birds. This disease is clearly not just associated with psittacine birds; many bird species are reservoirs including domestic poultry. The birds may not be ill. Psittacosis presents abruptly with a 1-to 2-week incubation period after bird exposure. It is a systemic illness with a respiratory component characterized by lobar pneumonia syndrome that can occasionally be fatal. Severe headache is a very prominent symptom in most patients. 69 The diagnosis is generally confirmed serologically. Treatment is with tetracyclines or macrolides.\r\n Many other infections can have respiratory symptoms as generally a minor manifestation of the clinical picture. Table 5 list several of the more common travel-related infections.\r\n Because, as noted, respiratory infections have a limited repertoire of signs and symptoms, it is un- likely that one can make a specific diagnosis of an infection on clinical grounds alone. The following can be used as a guideline for approaching the returning traveler with a potential respiratory infection: (1) consider non-travel-related pulmonary problems, including noninfectious causes; (2) consider the itinerary; (3) consider the incubation period; how long after return did the symptoms develop? (4) are there other travelers with a similar illness? (5) were there specific exposures on the trip that might predispose to a particular illness, eg, fresh-water swimming and schistosomiasis?\r\n Travel is common, and most incubation periods for acute infectious pulmonary diseases are long enough that patients may have symptoms after returning home to a health-care system that is not familiar with \"foreign\" infections. Respiratory infections have a relatively limited repertoire of clinical manifestations, so that there is often nothing characteristic enough about a specific infection to make the diagnosis obvious. Thus, the pathway to the diagnosis of infections that are not endemic in a region relies heavily on taking a thorough history of both itinerary and of specific exposures (eg, freshwater swimming in Africa, caving in Virginia, desert hiking in Arizona). One final caveat is that on occasion, the history of a recent trip creates an element of \"tunnel vision\" in the evaluating healthcare provider. It is tempting to relate a person's problem to that recent trip; however, when evaluating recent returnees it is always important to remember that the travel may have nothing to do with the patient's presentation. Recent travel adds diagnostic considerations to the list of possibilities.","sha":"cceb471096767cae3d64521532428afe376d78f7","publish_time":"2008-07-31","authors":"Gluckman, Stephen J.","journal":"Chest","doi":"10.1378\/chest.07-2954","Title":"Chest","H index":267.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"R espiratory tract infections are among the most common causes of medical problems that physicians manage. Recent foreign and domestic travel can add additional diagnostic considerations to the list of likely possibilities. Transportation is rapid enough that it can exceed the incubation period of many illnesses, so that patients might initially present after returning to health-care providers who are not accustomed to dealing with them. An outbreak of coccidioidomycosis in Washington State in a church group recently returned from Mexico is an example. Table 2 list some specific exposures to consider in the history. 7 In May 2007, a person with possible extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis was quarantined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) after air travel. Events such as these alert the public to infectious disease transmission on planes. Passengers with infection were clustered in a few rows directly in front of or behind the ill passenger. 9 Vogt et al 10 found no transmission on seven international flights carrying SARS patients. 15 Aircraft have been a great concern as a potential vector for the global spread of influenza. Air travel has resulted in international outbreaks of influenza and will likely be a major vector when the next pandemic occurs. During flight, the aircraft cabin has systems that control air exchanges. At cruising altitude, outside ambient air is virtually free of microorganisms. All commercial jet aircraft built after the late 1980s recirculate the cabin air: from 10 to 50% of the cabin air is filtered, mixed with outside, and then reintroduced into the passenger cabin. This can be compared to that of the standard modern office building that averages 12 exchanges per hour. 22 There is no evidence that recirculation of cabin air facilitates transmission of infectious disease agents on board, and the mechanisms described above to manage air flow should make risks minimal for passengers other than those sitting within close proximity to an index patient. This risk is also related to the efficacy of the cabin ventilation system. Cruise ships have also been associated with outbreaks of respiratory diseases, particularly Legionnaires disease. In our ongoing study of medical personnel working in a hospital in Botswana where 80% of the patients are infected with tuberculosis, we have found a rate of skin test conversion of 42\/1,000 person-months (Z. Szep, MD; personal communication; December 20, 2007) . Respiratory symptoms may not be initially prominent. Although accompanying GI symptoms and hyponatremia might be more prominent with Legionella pneumonia, there are no clinical, radiologic, or initial laboratory features that allow one to reliably distinguish this from other causes of lobar pneumonia. 34, 35 There are several options for diagnosis. Treatment should be with a newer macrolide or a quinolone. In resource-poor settings, erythromycin plus rifampin can be used. Subclinical infection is common in endemic areas. Recommended antibiotics include ceftazidine or carbapenems. In the United States, there is an endemic pocket in the Southwest. The disease progresses rapidly with cavitation common. The traditional medication has been streptomycin. Reservoirs are rabbits and small rodents, and the vectors are several different hemophagic arthropods. Although the clinical syndrome is not unique, recognition is greatly facilitated by obtaining a potential exposure history related to outdoor activity. Diagnosis is usually confirmed serologically. Although person-to-person transmission has been described, most transmission to humans occurs via aerosolization in buildings with heavy rodent infestations. The incubation period can be relatively long, lasting 1 to 4 weeks before the onset of initial symptoms of a \"typical\" viral syndrome with fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and myalgias; respiratory symptoms are generally at presentation. After several days, the abrupt onset of severe tachypnea and dry cough indicates noncardiogenic pulmonary edema due to severe capillary leak into the lungs. These include yellow fever, dengue, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Marburg, and Ebola. Dengue is widespread throughout the developing world, and yellow fever is endemic in periequatorial Africa and South America, while the others tend to occur in localized outbreaks primarily in Africa. A potential problem with this recommendation is the lack of available vaccine in the \"off\" season in the northern hemisphere. 51 Important laboratory clues include eosinophilic pleural fluid and a marked peripheral eosinophilia. Nodular infiltrates seem to be particularly common. There is no specific treatment for acute pulmonary schistosomiasis. The benefit of praziquantel for acute schistosomiasis is controversial because it only has efficacy against the adult worms. Corticosteroids are often prescribed to lessen symptoms. During larval migration, the stool is generally negative, although larva can be identified in sputum specimens. Strongyloides are treated with ivermectin. Ascaris and hookworm are treated with mebendazole. 59 Diethylcarbamazine has some efficacy, especially when administered early in the infection, but progressive interstitial fibrosis can result even if treated. Histoplasmosis is a fungus that is found throughout the world. It is particularly endemic in the Midwestern United States in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys. Most infections are asymptomatic, but when symptomatic pulmonary disease is the most common manifestation. Heavy exposure results in a much more severe illness after an incubation period of a week. The sensitivity of the tests varies with the severity of the syndrome. Antibody testing is the most sensitive, although it usually takes at least 4 weeks for antibodies to be detected. 60 If the patient undergoes BAL, the fluid can also be tested for antigen and stained for histoplasma. Treatment should be continued for 2 to 3 months. The only unusual laboratory marker is an eosinophilia seen in approximately one fourth of cases. Chest radiographic findings can be normal or may show infiltrates with associated hilar adenopathy. 64 -66 Q Fever Coxiella burnetti is found throughout the world. 68 The diagnosis is confirmed serologically, and standard treatment is with a tetracycline for 2 weeks, although macrolides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and floroquinones all are of benefit. Severe headache is a very prominent symptom in most patients.

Neutrophils infiltrate the airways of pediatric patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis in vast numbers: approximately 80% of infiltrated cells are neutrophils. However, why neutrophils are recruited to the site of viral respiratory tract infection is not clear. In this review we discuss the beneficial and pathologic contributions of neutrophils to the immune response against RSV infection. Neutrophils can limit viral replication and spread, as well as stimulate an effective antiviral adaptive immune response. However, low specificity of neutrophil antimicrobial armaments allows for collateral tissue damage. Neutrophilinduced injury to the airways during the delicate period of infant lung development has lasting adverse consequences for pulmonary architecture and might promote the onset of asthma in susceptible subjects. We suggest that pharmacologic modulation of neutrophils should be explored as a viable future therapy for severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis and thereby prevent the inception of subsequent asthma. The antiviral functions of neutrophils suggest that targeting of neutrophils in patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis is best performed under the umbrella of antiviral treatment. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2015;136:838-47.) ","text_body":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a ubiquitous seasonal human pathogen that, on infection of the upper respiratory tract, causes cold-like symptoms in most healthy adults and children. At 2 years of age, nearly all children will have been infected with RSV at least once. Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) by RSVare a major cause of morbidity and mortality among infants. Annual RSV-associated mortality is estimated at a quarter million deaths per year, of which 99% occur in developing countries, and it accounts for approximately 7% of deaths among infants younger than 1 year of age. 1 In the developed world 1% to 2% of infants are admitted to the hospital with RSV-induced bronchiolitis; therefore it is the foremost cause of infant hospitalization during the winter season. 2, 3 Severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis in infancy is linked to impaired lung function in adulthood and causally implicated in the onset of recurrent wheezing and asthma. [4] [5] [6] [7] Massive pulmonary neutrophil infiltration is observed in pediatric patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis. [8] [9] [10] In the lower airways neutrophils account for a median of 76% of infiltrated cells and a median of 93% in the upper airways, as measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and nasopharyngeal aspirates, respectively. 9 Similarly, postmortem histopathologic analyses of fatal RSV-related LRTI cases reveal extensive neutrophil infiltration of the airway wall and lumen, as well as the alveoli. 11 This begs the question of why neutrophils are recruited en masse to the site of viral respiratory tract infection. A wide variety of inflammatory stimuli purposefully attract neutrophils to the lungs, such as to clear invading bacteria, apoptotic debris, or foreign substances. Could neutrophils also function protectively during RSV infection?\r\n Neutrophils, the most abundant leukocytes in human circulation, are classically portrayed as unsophisticated, first-line foot soldiers with a role limited to the engulfment and subsequent elimination of invading extracellular bacteria and fungi. In this view lung-infiltrated neutrophils seem out of place during RSV infection. The promiscuous cytotoxicity of neutrophil antimicrobial armaments might even potentiate virus-induced lung injury. 12 Indeed, the degree of neutrophilic inflammation correlates with disease severity in patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis. 13 Moreover, a common single nucleotide polymorphism just upstream of the IL-8encoding gene that is tentatively associated with increased production of IL-8, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, is more frequent among infants with severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis, in particular among infants who lack other known risk factors. 14 Increased IL-8 levels in the airways of patients with bronchiolitis are linked to increased disease severity, as measured based on oxygen saturation, Silverman score, and respiratory rate. 15, 16 Genes related to neutrophil function, such as those encoding a-defensin-1 and elastase, are overexpressed in the blood of patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis, and expression levels positively correlate with disease severity. 17 Thus neutrophils are thought to contribute to lung injury in patients with severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis, but their exact role in pathogenesis is still unclear.\r\n A large body of epidemiologic evidence, including prospective case-control and cohort studies, implicates RSV-induced bronchiolitis during infancy in the inception of recurrent wheeze and lasting lung function impairment. [5] [6] [7] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] However, the association between wheeze and a history of RSV-induced bronchiolitis during infancy partially subsides with age. 7,32 It is not clear to what extent RSV-induced bronchiolitis is related to increased risk of asthma at school age or beyond. Nonetheless, nearly half of children with severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis present with asthma at 6 years of age. 5 Estimates indicate that early-life RSV-induced bronchiolitis is responsible for up to 13% of childhood asthma cases. 24 Moreover, smoking adults with RSVinduced bronchiolitis during infancy, but not those without LRTIs in early life, have an increased risk of persistent asthma. 26 However, association does not necessarily imply causation. Severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis could occur mainly in infants with pre-existing susceptibility to asthma development. Common genetic and\/or environmental factors appear to underlie predisposition to both diseases. 21 We recently addressed the issue of causality in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with RSV immunoprophylaxis of healthy preterm infants, in which we demonstrated a causal relationship between RSV-induced bronchiolitis and the development of recurrent wheeze. 4 Although wheezing in early life is a strong risk factor for asthma in (early) adulthood, 33 asthma trials are needed to provide conclusive evidence that RSV disease is causally related to persistent asthma.\r\n Neutrophils play an important role in asthma exacerbations by inducing mucus hypersecretion and airway remodeling, which result in acute reversible and progressive irreversible airway obstruction, respectively. 34, 35 Although neutrophils are thought to affect lung function decrease, their role in asthma inception during viral bronchiolitis is understudied. Nonetheless, the severity of infant bronchiolitis shows a dose-response relationship with the risk and morbidity of childhood asthma, 22 and as discussed above, the degree of neutrophilic inflammation correlates with the severity of RSV-induced bronchiolitis. 13, 15, 16 Therefore severe neutrophilic lung inflammation during infancy could tenably predispose children to subsequent wheezing and onset of asthma. Indeed, a functional IL-8 polymorphism more frequent among infants with severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis is also overrepresented in infants who had postbronchiolitis wheezing compared with patients with bronchiolitis who did not have wheezing afterward. 14,36 Neutrophilic inflammation-induced collateral tissue damage and airway sensitization could mediate the development of asthma susceptibility.\r\n Transient damage to development of infant lungs can have farreaching and lasting adverse consequences for pulmonary anatomy and function; this is particularly true if the critical process of alveolar multiplication by septation is disrupted. 37 Elastin fibers, which are present in alveolar duct and septal walls, provide elasticity to the lungs and transmit cues of mechanical stress to stimulate alveolarization. Neutrophil elastase, which is released on neutrophil recruitment to the lungs, degrades elastin fibers and thereby demolishes lung tissue structure. 38 Through elastase release and other lung-damaging mechanisms discussed below, the massive pulmonary neutrophil infiltrate of pediatric patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis might thus cause irreparable disruption of lung development that predisposes these infants to subsequent asthma inception (Fig 1) . In addition to inducing airway remodeling through collateral tissue damage, neutrophils might sensitize the airways to asthma through mast cell recruitment. IL-9 is detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis, and airwayinfiltrated neutrophils are the principal producers. 39 In response to pulmonary expression of IL-9, long-lived mast cells migrate to and accumulate in lung tissue. 40, 41 Lung-resident mast cells, specifically those located in the bronchial smooth muscle bundles, contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness and are considered crucial to the pathogenesis of (allergic) asthma (Fig 1) . 42 Dampening excessive neutrophilic inflammation during RSVinduced bronchiolitis might protect lung function, curtail airway sensitization, and reduce the risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma. A proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial of macrolide treatment in patients with RSVinduced bronchiolitis provides tentative clinical support in favor of dampening neutrophilic inflammation. 43 Macrolides have antineutrophilic activities in vitro and attenuate neutrophilic airway inflammation in patients with refractory asthma and during RSV infection in mice. [44] [45] [46] In comparison with placebo-treated patients, macrolide-treated patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis showed reduced nasal lavage IL-8 levels, experienced fewer days after bronchiolitis with respiratory symptoms, tended toward fewer subsequent wheezing episodes, and exhibited a delayed third wheezing episode. 43 RSV immunoprophylaxis is costly and available only to highrisk infants, for whom it reduces RSV-related hospitalization by approximately 50%. 47 For patients, supportive care is the sole treatment regimen available. Clearly, new treatment options for severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis are required to ameliorate disease and reduce sequelae, asthma in particular. The prominent neutrophilic inflammation in patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis represents a promising target.\r\n Below, we examine the role of neutrophils in patients with RSV infection and discuss the relevance thereof for therapy and asthma prevention. Because studies performed with RSV in this regard are scarce, we will also draw information from the literature on other viruses, in particular influenza virus, infections with which also exhibit severe pulmonary neutrophil infiltration.\r\n Neutrophils can injure the lungs in multiple ways: (1) release of proteolytic enzymes, including elastase, into the microenvironment through degranulation; (2) production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); (3) formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by the cell death program known as NETosis; and (4) stimulation of mucus production (Fig 2) .\r\n Neutrophil migration into the airways during influenza infection in mice depends on the neutrophil tertiary granule-expressed matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9, which digests extracellular Protective and lung-injurious roles of neutrophils during respiratory tract viral infection. Neutrophilinduced mucus production limits access of viral particles to the epithelium but obstructs airflow. Degranulation releases antimicrobial mediators that are also cytotoxic to host cells. Phagocytosis of (opsonized) viral particles and virus-infected cells limits viral spread. NETs capture and deactivate viral particles but also damage healthy bystander cells. ECM, Extracellular matrix; PRMs, pattern recognition molecules.\r\n matrix. MMP9-mediated neutrophil influx into the airways is required for the control of influenza virus replication in mouse lungs. 48 However, excessive MMP9 proteolytic activity in response to high viral loads exacerbates pathology. 48 Pulmonary inflammation caused by noninfectious agents, such as cigarette smoke, implicate other neutrophil proteolytic enzymes, including cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase, and proteinase 3, in lung tissue destruction as well. 49 The inflammatory milieu in the lungs during RSV infection induces the neutrophil oxidative burst. 50 The abundantly produced ROS indiscriminately oxidize biomolecules, which compromises their function. Therefore ROS are potently antimicrobial but also damage host cellular structures. Oxidative stress during RSV infection promotes lung injury. 51, 52 Thus neutrophil-derived ROS are likely to contribute to lung damage in patients with RSV infection.\r\n NETs are DNA-based meshes decorated with histones and granular antimicrobial proteins and peptides, including elastase, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and a-defensins. By trapping microbes in NETs, microbial spread can be minimized and microbe killing optimized by high local concentrations of antimicrobial proteins and peptides. 53 Exposure of neutrophils to RSV particles in vitro induces NET formation through specific interaction of RSV fusion (F) protein with neutrophil-expressed Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4. 54 Data on the in vivo antiviral activity of NETs are conflicting. 55 Genetic ablation of peptidylarginine deiminase 4, which is required for NET formation, did not affect viral replication or mortality in mice infected with influenza virus. 56 Instead, NETs are located in areas of alveolar damage in the lungs of influenza virus-infected mice. 57 In vitro NETs directly damage alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells. The histone component of NETs is chiefly responsible for this cytotoxic effect. 58 This suggests that NETs induce lung injury rather than suppressing viral replication. However, the absence of NETs in peptidylarginine deiminase 4-deficient mice does not reduce lung pathology during influenza infection either. 56 In this mouse model of human influenza virus infection, NETs appear to play neither a beneficial nor a pathologic role. The contribution of NETs during viral infection might be virus specific and depend on the degree of NET induction.\r\n In addition to directly damaging the respiratory tract, neutrophils can contribute to airway obstruction by inducing mucus production. Mucus forms a protective barrier to viral infection by limiting access of viral particles to the pulmonary epithelium. However, excessive mucus production might cause airway obstruction. Mouse neutrophils promote the expression of mucin, the chief component of mucus, during RSV infection. 59 Thus the extensive neutrophil infiltration in the lungs might contribute to the airway obstruction and resultant wheezing observed in patients with severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis.\r\n Pulmonary IL-17 enhances neutrophil recruitment to the lungs early in RSV infection by inducing IL-8 production in airway epithelial cells. 60 The amount of IL-17 in the lungs of pediatric patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis correlates to the degree of subsequent pulmonary neutrophil influx. 60 Additionally, IL-17 induces the production of obstructive mucus in the airways. 61 This suggests that IL-17 plays a pathogenic role during LRTIs by RSV. The association of a polymorphism in the gene encoding IL-17 with severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis supports this notion. 62 Moreover, the response of T H 17 cells, noted producers of IL-17, is enhanced in infants with RSV-induced bronchiolitis. 63 An RSV mouse model also links IL-17 and T H 17 responses to RSV disease severity: pulmonary neutrophil recruitment and lung pathology are exacerbated in RSV-infected mice, which have increased T H 17 responses caused by genetic ablation of the IL-27 receptor. 64 Moreover, genetic ablation or antibody-mediated blocking of IL-17 in RSV-infected mice reduces neutrophilic inflammation, mucus production, and viral loads and improves the cytotoxic T-cell response against RSV. 65 Nonetheless, it is not clear whether local IL-17 levels are protective or harmful. IL-17 reduces airway reactivity of RSV-infected mice presensitized with ovalbumin, 66 and mice that received a novel attenuated Bordetella pertussis vaccine were protected from RSV infection in an IL-17-dependent fashion. 67 It is possible that a limited IL-17 response is protective, whereas excessive IL-17 production induces immune pathology through unrestrained neutrophil recruitment. However, the early recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs of patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis is unlikely to be mediated by an adaptive T H 17 response because RSV antigen-driven clonal expansion and differentiation of T H 17 cells require several days. Instead, there might be a role for natural T H 17 cells that acquire effector functions during thymic development and regulate early-phase airway neutrophil responses. 68, 69 Thus (natural) T H 17 cells and IL-17 might promote a pathogenic neutrophildominated response to RSV infection.\r\n The neutrophil antimicrobial arsenal, although damaging to the lungs if deployed excessively, has also shown efficacy against viruses in addition to its traditional bacterial and fungal targets. Based on this, a contribution of neutrophils to antiviral defense is suggested. 55, 70, 71 Indeed, a beneficial role for neutrophils in patients with viral respiratory tract infections has been reported for influenza virus. [72] [73] [74] [75] Neutrophil depletion in mice by neutrophil-specific anti-Ly6G antibody treatment results in enhanced viral replication and lung damage. 72 Therefore neutrophil recruitment to the airways during RSV infection could also be a protective response. Neutrophils mediate direct antimicrobial effects through, in essence, 3 known effector mechanisms, namely (1) phagocytosis, (2) degranulation, and (3) NET formation (Fig 2 and Table I ). [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] By means of phagocytosis, neutrophils can eliminate RSVinfected cells, thereby preventing further viral replication, and engulf virions to limit infection of new cells. Blocking the recognition and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by local Annexin V administration 1 day after influenza virus inoculation increases mortality among mice. 76 Both mouse macrophages and neutrophils phagocytose influenza virus-infected apoptotic cells in vivo. 77 This process is amplified by TLR4, 77 which recognizes RSV F protein expressed on the surfaces of virions and infected cells. 87 Moreover, as shown in vitro for herpes simplex virus, antibody-and complement-mediated opsonization facilitates the phagocytosis of viral particles and virus-infected cells by neutrophils. 88 Neutrophil granules contain antimicrobial proteins and peptides, including a-defensins 1 to 4 (or human neutrophil peptides [HNPs] 1-4), cathelicidins (ie, LL-37), pentraxin (PTX) 3, and MPO, which are released into the microenvironment on degranulation. 89 Neutrophils degranulate in response to in vitro stimulation with RSV particles. 90 HNPs are small, cationic amphipathic peptides that demonstrate antiviral activity. For instance, multiple steps of cellular entry by HIV-1 are inhibited by HNP-1, 78 and HNPs promote influenza virus aggregation and uptake by neutrophils. 79 Whether the antiviral activity of HNPs extends to RSV is not currently known, but the broad antiviral activities of HPNs against multiple enveloped and nonenveloped viruses hints at the possibility. 91 Recent in vitro work demonstrates that the cationic antimicrobial peptide LL-37 possesses direct antiviral activity against RSV virions, protects infected epithelial cells against RSV-induced cell death, inhibits production of new viral particles, and reduces the susceptibly of epithelial cells to RSV infection. 80 Low serum levels of LL-37 precursor (ie, hCAP-18) are associated with severe infantile RSV-induced bronchiolitis. 81 PTXs are soluble pattern recognition molecules that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and mediate innate humoral immunity, functionally resembling antibodies of the adaptive immune system. PTX3 can activate compliment through recruitment of C1q (ie, the classical pathway) and act as opsonins by interacting with the FcgRIII (CD16) and FcgRII (CD32) receptors, which are expressed by phagocytes, including neutrophils. 92 Mature neutrophils represent a major reservoir of preformed ready-to-use PTX3, as well as other pattern recognition molecules. 93 Direct evidence of PTX3-mediated antiviral activity against RSV is lacking but has been demonstrated for influenza virus and mouse coronavirus. PTX3 reduces the infectivity of both viruses. Moreover, PTX3-deficient mice inoculated with either virus fare worse than their wild-type counterparts but can be rescued by administration of exogenous PTX3. 82, 83 MPO catalyzes the production of hypochlorous acid, which is a potent antimicrobial ROS, because of its ability to chlorinate and oxidize a great variety of biomolecules. Secreted and NET-bound MPO deactivates HIV-1 particles in vitro. 84, 85 The RSV F protein induces formation of MPO-coated NETs through TLR4, 54 and HIV-1 triggers NETosis through a TLR7\/TLR8-and ROSdependent pathway. NET-bound MPO and HNPs abolish the infectivity of HIV-1 particles. In coculture neutrophils reduce the infection of CD4 1 T cells by HIV-1 in a NET-dependent manner. 85 Thus NETs are elicited by stimulation with virus and possess direct antiviral activity in vitro.\r\n Furthermore, the release of NETs by neutrophils during intravenous myxoma poxvirus challenge in mice protects against viral infection of liver cells. 86 Therefore NETs can benefit antiviral defense in vivo. As discussed above, NETosis deficiency does not affect the course of disease in human influenza virus-inoculated mice. 56 A contribution, protective or damaging, of NETs to antiviral defense might be virus and organ (eg, liver vs lung) specific.\r\n Recent studies demonstrate multiple immune regulatory functions for neutrophils. In addition to their role as effector cells in patients with RSV infection described above, neutrophils can also act as immune regulatory cells (Fig 3) . Although neutrophilmediated immune regulation in the context of RSV infection has yet to be examined directly, general concepts can be derived from studies with other viruses and guide further research into the severely understudied role of neutrophils in patients with RSV infection. Here we focus on regulatory roles potentially involved in RSV infection. For a more complete overview, the reader is referred to a number of recent reviews. 89, [93] [94] [95] Neutrophils can promote antiviral CD8 1 T-cell responses. Influenza virus antigen-displaying neutrophils stimulate lunginfiltrated CD8 1 T cells to produce IFN-g, whereas infected epithelial cells only elicit their own cytolysis. 96, 97 Stimulation of IFN-g production by neutrophils can enhance antiviral defense against RSV infection. 98 The CD8 1 T-cell response to influenza in the airways of mice is maintained by infiltrated neutrophils. 75 Neutrophils thus regulate CD8 1 T-cell effector function at the site of viral infection. Neutrophils efficiently cross-present phagocytosed antigen to naive CD8 1 T cells in vivo to stimulate proliferation, IFN-g production, and cytolytic activity. 99 By acting as viral antigen shuttles, neutrophils can indirectly induce an antiviral CD8 1 T-cell response. Mouse neutrophils take up modified vaccinia Ankara virus in skin, transport viral antigen to the bone marrow, and there, through local phagocytic antigen-presenting cells, trigger virus-specific CD8 1 T-cell proliferation and establishment of memory. 100 Moreover, neutrophils can indirectly stimulate T-cell responses by recruiting immature dendritic cells (DCs) to a site of infection through CCL3 secretion 101 and by inducing DC maturation through direct cell-cell contact, which depends on altered glycosylation patterns of Mac-1 (CD11b\/CD18) and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CAECAM1) that are specific to activated neutrophils. 102, 103 The homeostasis of innate cytotoxic lymphocytes (ie, natural killer [NK] cells) is neutrophil dependent. [104] [105] [106] Neutropenic patients and neutrophil-depleted mice present with immature hyporesponsive NK cells. 104 Neutrophils stimulate NK cells through IL-18 production and the interaction of The adaptive humoral response is stimulated by neutrophils as well. Through cytokine secretion (ie, B cell-activating factor of the TNF family [BAFF], a proliferation inducing ligand [APRIL], and IL-21), splenic neutrophils induce immunoglobulin classswitch recombination, somatic hypermutation, and antibody production by marginal zone B cells. 107 Neutrophils can also suppress adaptive immune responses. Systemic inflammation in human subjects induces a neutrophil subset with T cell-suppressive capabilities. These suppressive neutrophils form Mac-1-dependent immunologic synapses with T cells and locally produce bursts of membrane-associated hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) that suppress T-cell proliferation. 108 Furthermore, neutrophil-derived thromboxane limits T-cell cytokine production in response to protein-in-adjuvant vaccination of mice and suppresses the spread of the T-cell response from the draining lymph nodes of the injection site to distal lymph nodes. 109 Neutrophils can indirectly suppress T-cell responses through deposition of MPO in lymph nodes, which impairs DC function. 110 In a more passive manner neutrophils might contribute to the resolution of inflammation. Depending on environmental stimuli, macrophages can acquire a proinflammatory or proresolution phenotype. The phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages induces a regulatory phenotype in macrophages, which might contribute to the resolution of inflammation. 111 In RSVinfected cotton rats, proresolution macrophages limit lung pathology. 112 \r\n Is it conceivable that neutrophils are abundantly present in the airways during severe RSV infection without playing a major role in either the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis or the subsequent inception of asthma? Although indicators of neutrophilic inflammation, including airway IL-8 levels and neutrophil elastase activity, correlate with the severity of bronchiolitis, cell counts of airway-infiltrated neutrophils, which are invariably high, are not associated with RSV disease severity. 10, 13, 15, 16, 113 Similar to RSV-induced bronchiolitis, extensive neutrophil infiltration of the airways and alveoli is observed during bacterial pneumonia, usually in the absence of wheezing. If neutrophils contribute to the inception of asthma after bronchiolitis, an increased risk of asthma should also be observed after bacterial respiratory tract infections in early childhood. Evidence in support of this is limited to observations in a high-risk birth cohort. 31 Future studies should attempt to validate the relationship between bacterial respiratory tract infection during infancy and the subsequent development of reactive airway disease.\r\n The vast number of lung-infiltrating neutrophils in patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis appears to be the principal instigator of pulmonary immunopathology. The secretion of proteolytic enzymes, such as elastase, the production of ROS, and NET release can clearly injure the lungs. This might disrupt the delicate process of lung development in infancy and have lasting adverse consequences for lung anatomy, function, and susceptibility to chronic disease, including asthma. However, through direct antiviral activity of these and other neutrophil mechanisms, as well as through regulation of adaptive immune responses, neutrophils can also contribute to a protective antiviral response. In patients with severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis, the balance between neutrophil antimicrobial activity and collateral tissue damage appears to have shifted toward a pathologic response. Hence pharmacologic suppression of neutrophil activity could curtail lung injury. Possible approaches include (1) neutrophil-inhibitory macrolides 43,46 ; (2) inhibiting damaging neutrophil-derived products, such as elastase 114 ; (3) antagonizing neutrophil-modulatory adenosine 115 ; (4) neutrophil chemokine receptor blockade 116, 117 ; (5) and targeting neutrophil-expressed inhibitory receptors. 118, 119 We eagerly await the results of future clinical trials for the treatment of RSV infection with pharmacologic agents that can effectively dampen neutrophilic inflammation, such as the selective small-molecule CXCR2 (IL-8 receptor) antagonist danirixin (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02201303). 117 The relationship between extensive neutrophil infiltration of the airways in early life and later asthma development might not be limited to RSV infection. Lower respiratory tract illnesses in infants induced by other viruses are also associated with subsequent wheeze and asthma. 7,31,120 Limited evidence also hints at a causal association between bacterial invasion of the respiratory tract and subsequent asthma development. [121] [122] [123] Colonization of neonatal airways by pathogenic bacteria induces neutrophil response-associated cytokines and is associated with development of persistent wheezing and childhood asthma in a prospective birth cohort. 124, 125 Moreover, among prospectively followed high-risk children, respiratory tract infections by pathogenic bacteria in early life were associated with an increased risk of school-age asthma. 31 In fact, rather than a specific viral or bacterial pathogen, the total number of early respiratory tract infections correlated with the risk of childhood asthma in this study. 31 Although injurious when present in excess, neutrophils are essential to antimicrobial defense. The safety of treating RSVinduced bronchiolitis with neutrophil suppression could improve with the administration of RSV antivirals and prophylactic antibiotics. Recently, a newly developed RSV antiviral was successfully tested in a clinical trial wherein healthy adult subjects were challenged with RSV. 126 By itself, however, an RSV antiviral might confer limited benefit when administered several days after onset of symptoms. For influenza, oseltamivir is only effective when administered within 36 to 48 hours after symptom onset. 127 Similarly, antiviral treatments against RSV should ideally be administered as close to initial infection as possible to be at their most effective, yet RSV loads are already on the decrease when patients are admitted to the intensive care unit. 128 Nonetheless, neutrophils are still abundantly present in the lungs, [9] [10] [11] and thus neutrophil-mediated damage to the airways persists (Fig 2) . Therefore we propose that suppressing neutrophil activity under the umbrella of RSVantivirals and prophylactic antibiotics offers a promising treatment strategy to improve the outcomes of infants with RSV-induced bronchiolitis and reduce the risk of subsequent asthma.","sha":"b1735d2bf2120775db46e1803d1c92023d22e60d","publish_time":"2015-10-31","authors":"Geerdink, Ruben J.; Pillay, Janesh; Meyaard, Linde; Bont, Louis","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","doi":"10.1016\/j.jaci.2015.06.034","Title":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","H index":262.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a ubiquitous seasonal human pathogen that, on infection of the upper respiratory tract, causes cold-like symptoms in most healthy adults and children. 1 In the developed world 1% to 2% of infants are admitted to the hospital with RSV-induced bronchiolitis; therefore it is the foremost cause of infant hospitalization during the winter season. 2, 3 Severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis in infancy is linked to impaired lung function in adulthood and causally implicated in the onset of recurrent wheezing and asthma. [ 17 Thus neutrophils are thought to contribute to lung injury in patients with severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis, but their exact role in pathogenesis is still unclear. 5] [6] [7] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] However, the association between wheeze and a history of RSV-induced bronchiolitis during infancy partially subsides with age. 26 However, association does not necessarily imply causation. Common genetic and\/or environmental factors appear to underlie predisposition to both diseases. 21 We recently addressed the issue of causality in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with RSV immunoprophylaxis of healthy preterm infants, in which we demonstrated a causal relationship between RSV-induced bronchiolitis and the development of recurrent wheeze. 34, 35 Although neutrophils are thought to affect lung function decrease, their role in asthma inception during viral bronchiolitis is understudied. 14,36 Neutrophilic inflammation-induced collateral tissue damage and airway sensitization could mediate the development of asthma susceptibility. Transient damage to development of infant lungs can have farreaching and lasting adverse consequences for pulmonary anatomy and function; this is particularly true if the critical process of alveolar multiplication by septation is disrupted. Neutrophil elastase, which is released on neutrophil recruitment to the lungs, degrades elastin fibers and thereby demolishes lung tissue structure. 47 For patients, supportive care is the sole treatment regimen available. Clearly, new treatment options for severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis are required to ameliorate disease and reduce sequelae, asthma in particular. Neutrophils can injure the lungs in multiple ways: (1) release of proteolytic enzymes, including elastase, into the microenvironment through degranulation; (2) production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); (3) formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by the cell death program known as NETosis; and (4) stimulation of mucus production (Fig 2) . Neutrophil migration into the airways during influenza infection in mice depends on the neutrophil tertiary granule-expressed matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9, which digests extracellular Protective and lung-injurious roles of neutrophils during respiratory tract viral infection. Degranulation releases antimicrobial mediators that are also cytotoxic to host cells. ECM, Extracellular matrix; PRMs, pattern recognition molecules. Oxidative stress during RSV infection promotes lung injury. However, the absence of NETs in peptidylarginine deiminase 4-deficient mice does not reduce lung pathology during influenza infection either. The contribution of NETs during viral infection might be virus specific and depend on the degree of NET induction. In addition to directly damaging the respiratory tract, neutrophils can contribute to airway obstruction by inducing mucus production. 60 The amount of IL-17 in the lungs of pediatric patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis correlates to the degree of subsequent pulmonary neutrophil influx. 62 Moreover, the response of T H 17 cells, noted producers of IL-17, is enhanced in infants with RSV-induced bronchiolitis. Based on this, a contribution of neutrophils to antiviral defense is suggested. 72] [73] [74] [75] Neutrophil depletion in mice by neutrophil-specific anti-Ly6G antibody treatment results in enhanced viral replication and lung damage. 72 Therefore neutrophil recruitment to the airways during RSV infection could also be a protective response. 89 Neutrophils degranulate in response to in vitro stimulation with RSV particles. 90 HNPs are small, cationic amphipathic peptides that demonstrate antiviral activity. For instance, multiple steps of cellular entry by HIV-1 are inhibited by HNP-1, 78 and HNPs promote influenza virus aggregation and uptake by neutrophils. 91 Recent in vitro work demonstrates that the cationic antimicrobial peptide LL-37 possesses direct antiviral activity against RSV virions, protects infected epithelial cells against RSV-induced cell death, inhibits production of new viral particles, and reduces the susceptibly of epithelial cells to RSV infection. PTX3 reduces the infectivity of both viruses. Secreted and NET-bound MPO deactivates HIV-1 particles in vitro. As discussed above, NETosis deficiency does not affect the course of disease in human influenza virus-inoculated mice. Recent studies demonstrate multiple immune regulatory functions for neutrophils. In addition to their role as effector cells in patients with RSV infection described above, neutrophils can also act as immune regulatory cells (Fig 3) . Although neutrophilmediated immune regulation in the context of RSV infection has yet to be examined directly, general concepts can be derived from studies with other viruses and guide further research into the severely understudied role of neutrophils in patients with RSV infection. Here we focus on regulatory roles potentially involved in RSV infection. For a more complete overview, the reader is referred to a number of recent reviews. Influenza virus antigen-displaying neutrophils stimulate lunginfiltrated CD8 1 T cells to produce IFN-g, whereas infected epithelial cells only elicit their own cytolysis. 75 Neutrophils thus regulate CD8 1 T-cell effector function at the site of viral infection. 100 Moreover, neutrophils can indirectly stimulate T-cell responses by recruiting immature dendritic cells (DCs) to a site of infection through CCL3 secretion 101 and by inducing DC maturation through direct cell-cell contact, which depends on altered glycosylation patterns of Mac-1 (CD11b\/CD18) and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CAECAM1) that are specific to activated neutrophils. 109 Neutrophils can indirectly suppress T-cell responses through deposition of MPO in lymph nodes, which impairs DC function. 112 \r\n Is it conceivable that neutrophils are abundantly present in the airways during severe RSV infection without playing a major role in either the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis or the subsequent inception of asthma? 10, 13, 15, 16, 113 Similar to RSV-induced bronchiolitis, extensive neutrophil infiltration of the airways and alveoli is observed during bacterial pneumonia, usually in the absence of wheezing. 124, 125 Moreover, among prospectively followed high-risk children, respiratory tract infections by pathogenic bacteria in early life were associated with an increased risk of school-age asthma. Recently, a newly developed RSV antiviral was successfully tested in a clinical trial wherein healthy adult subjects were challenged with RSV. Therefore we propose that suppressing neutrophil activity under the umbrella of RSVantivirals and prophylactic antibiotics offers a promising treatment strategy to improve the outcomes of infants with RSV-induced bronchiolitis and reduce the risk of subsequent asthma."},{"Unnamed: 0":45,"Unnamed: 0.1":45,"doc_id":"03a2f9a8c86cde90a603a64a608290d98fed9aa0","title":"Health care delivery and quality Risk factors for wheezing in a subtropical environment: Role of respiratory viruses and allergen sensitization","abstract":"Background: Risk factors for acute wheezing among children in subtropical areas are largely unknown.

(J Allergy Clin Immunol 2004;113:551-7.)","text_body":"Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood. Evidence indicates that more than half of the cases of persistent asthma start before the age of 3 years, and it is now clear that airway inflammation and irreversible remodeling may be initiated early in life. 1, 2 Definitive diagnosis of asthma and subsequent decision to initiate long-term anti-inflammatory treatment at an early age has been a challenge in pediatric practice. 3 Although asthma in young children appears to represent a heterogeneous disease with distinct phenotypes, sensitization to common inhalant allergens including those derived from dust mites, cockroach, cat, and Alternaria remains a major risk factor for persistent asthma associated with airway hyperreactivity and decreased lung function. [4] [5] [6] Respiratory viruses have been recognized as major triggers of wheezing episodes and asthma exacerbation. 7 In the northern hemisphere, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for the majority of wheezing episodes in children younger than 2 years of age, being detected in 60% to 80% of infants. 7 Results of the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study 8 revealed that lower respiratory tract infection with RSV early in life was associated with persistent wheezing; however, by age 13 years, lung function abnormalities were no longer present and wheezing resolved in most children. In one study, severe RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of life has been linked to asthma and allergic sensitization at age 7 years 9 ; however, studies to determine whether RSV infections enhance allergy have provided conflicting results. 7 It has been definitely established that specific IgE response to RSV is not an important element in the pathogenesis of RSVinduced wheezing 10 ; however, the virus has been shown to induce expression of cytokines and chemokines and activation of monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes, which may influence the mechanisms involved in the development of asthma in children. 7 In older children, rhinovirus becomes the dominant viral pathogen linked to wheezing exacerbations. This has been demonstrated in community-based and emergency department studies. 11, 12 In the emergency department setting, rhinovirus infections act synergistically with allergen sensitization and\/or allergen exposure to induce severe asthma symptoms in both children and adults. 12, 13 In keeping with this, lower respiratory tract symptoms and markers of inflammation in young adults with mild asthma experimentally infected with rhinovirus are more pronounced in those with high total IgE. 14 It is thought that a deficient T H 1-type response with decreased IFN-\u03b3 production underlies the observation that rhinovirus infections in atopic individuals are more severe and longer-lasting and induce more lower respiratory symptoms as compared with nonatopic subjects. 15 The purpose of the current study was to investigate the role of viral infections, allergen sensitization, and exposure to indoor allergens as risk factors for acute wheezing in children 0 to 12 years old living in a subtropical environment. The results of the current study may contribute to promote better care of children with wheezing in these areas.\r\n One hundred thirty-two children 0 to 12 years of age (80 boys) who sought emergency department (ED) care for wheezing either at the Clinical Hospital of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo School of Medicine of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto or Santa Lydia community Hospital were enrolled in this case-control study. Patients were selected for the study if they presented with wheezing that required therapy with inhaled \u03b22-agonists as judged by the attending physician. In addition, 65 children 0 to 12 years of age (39 boys) without respiratory symptoms and no previous history of wheezing who sought ED care at the same hospitals for other reasons were selected as control subjects. The most frequent complaints among the control subjects were acute gastroenteritis, fever, abdominal pain, headache, vomiting, and seizures. Children with chronic respiratory illnesses (n = 2) (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) and those who reported therapy with corticosteroids within 4 weeks before the ED visit (n = 8) were not included in the study. All children were residents in the city of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto. Wheezing and control children were enrolled every month from October 1998 to June 2000, except for December 1998. Approximately 3% of all children seen in the ED over the study period were enrolled in the study, and 95% of the children approached were enrolled. Peaks of attendance to the ED for wheezing were observed in both years; 61% and 68%, respectively, of wheezing and control children under 2 years of age were enrolled from February through May and 52% and 60% of wheezing and control children older than 2 years were enrolled from March through June.\r\n Parents or guardians completed a questionnaire that included questions on personal and family history of allergies and asthma, passive exposure to tobacco smoke, breast-feeding, and housing conditions. A positive personal history of allergy was defined as a report of physician-diagnosed asthma, rhinitis, and\/or atopic dermatitis. A positive family history for allergy was characterized by the report of asthma, rhinitis, and\/or atopic dermatitis diagnosed by a physician in the mother, father, and\/or sibling(s). History of prior wheezing illnesses was reported for 48% of the wheezing children younger than 2 years and for 93% of the older wheezing children. However, only 16% of the wheezing infants and 51% of the wheezing children older than 2 years reported asthma diagnosed by a physician. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of both hospitals and the children's parents and\/or guardians gave written informed consent to participate in the study.\r\n Nasal washings were collected and processed for detection of respiratory viruses as previously described. 12 RSV antigen was detected by using both a rapid enzyme immunoassay (Test-Pack, Abbott, Chicago, Ill) and an indirect immunofluorescence (Chemicon, Temecula, Calif). Human rhinovirus and coronavirus RNA was detected by RT-PCR. 12, 16 Influenza and parainfluenza viruses were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. 17, 18 In a subset consisting of 90 of 132 wheezing children and 48 of 65 control subjects, from whom remaining material was available, detection of adenovirus was investigated by culture of frozen nasal aspirates on A549 cells, with cytopathic effect confirmed by immunofluorescence. Typing of adenovirus isolated from cultures to the subgenus level was performed by amplification of the VA-RNA region of the viral genome by PCR, according to previously described method. 19 PCR products of 520 to 522 bp and 505 bp in length corresponded to adenovirus subgenera B and C, respectively. Certain adenovirus serotypes including those of subgenus C can be identified in nasal aspirates up to several weeks after acute infection. 20 To minimize the interference of latent adenovirus, only subgenus B was included in the analysis.\r\n Serum levels of total IgE and specific IgE to mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, D farinae, and Blomia tropicalis), cockroach (Blattella germanica), cat, dog, foods (cow's milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanut, and fish), and to Ascaris lumbricoides were measured with the use of the UniCAP system (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Specific IgE levels \u22650.7 kU\/L (CAP score \u22652) were considered positive. Automated white blood cell counts were carried out with the use of a Colter T540 system, and differential counts, including eosinophil quantification, were performed manually.\r\n Dust samples were collected from four sites in each subject's home: bedding, bedroom floor, TV room, and kitchen, within 3 weeks of the ED visit. Dust collection and preparation of dust extracts were performed according to standard procedures. 21 Measurements of major allergens from mites (group 1 and group 2), cockroach (Bla g 1 and Bla g 2), cat (Fel d 1), and dog (Can f 1) in dust extracts were carried out with the use of monoclonal antibody-based ELISA. 22 Group 1 mite allergens comprised the sum of levels of Der p 1 and Der f 1. Group 2 allergens (Der p 2 and Der f 2) were simultaneously detected in the monoclonal antibody ELISA with a cross-reactive capture antibody (1D8). High-level exposure was defined as the presence of at least one dust sample in the house containing concentrations of group 1 mite allergens (\u226510 \u00b5g\/g, Bla g 1 \u22658 U\/g, and\/or Bla g 2 \u22650.32 \u00b5g\/g, Fel d 1 \u22658 \u00b5g\/g, and Can f 1 \u226510 \u00b5g\/g). 22 Health care delivery and quality\r\n ED: Emergency department GM: Geometric mean RSV: Respiratory syncytial virus\r\n Data from wheezing and control children were compared in two age groups: children younger than 2 years of age (n = 74 and n = 30, respectively) and children 2 to 12 years of age (n = 58 and n = 35, respectively). Data on total IgE levels were log-transformed and analyzed by Student t test. Peripheral blood eosinophils and allergen levels in house dust were analyzed by Mann-Whitney test. Chisquare analysis was used to compare the prevalence of elevated specific IgE, positive viral tests, frequency of passive smoke exposure, and high-level allergen exposure. Univariate and multivariate analysis were carried out by logistic regression, using the software STATA version 6.0.\r\n In the group of children under 2 years of age, respiratory viruses were detected in 60.8% (45 of 74) wheezing infants and in 13.3% (4 of 30) control infants (P < .001). RSV was detected in 39% wheezing children and none of the control infants (P < .001). Rhinovirus RNA was found in 20.2% and 10% of the wheezing and control children, respectively (P = .21). Adenovirus was cultured from 29.4% (15\/51) of wheezing children and 20.8% (5\/24) of control children; 4 and 1 isolates were identified as subgenus B (7.8% and 4.1%), respectively (P = .55). Coronavirus RNA was found in 3 of 73 wheezing subjects and none of 30 control subjects. Influenza A and B and parainfluenza viruses were not detected (Fig 1) . Five wheezing children were positive for more than one virus.\r\n In the group of children 2 to 12 years of age, respiratory viruses were not significantly associated with wheezing. Rhinovirus RNA was detected in 19.3% wheezing children as compared with 17.1% of the nonwheezing control children (P = .80); RSV antigen was detected in 10.3% and 8.5%, respectively (P = .70), and adenovirus was isolated from 23% (9\/39) and 17.8% (5\/28), respectively; 4 and 0 (10.5% and 0%) of the adenovirus isolates were identified as subgenus B (P = .07). Coronavirus, influenza A and B, and parainfluenza viruses were not found in children older than 2 years (Fig 1) .\r\n In children under 2 years of age, geometric mean (GM) total IgE levels were 19.7 IU\/mL (range <2 IU\/mL to 1709 IU\/mL) in wheezing infants and 9.4 IU\/mL (range < 2 IU\/mL to 620 IU\/mL) in control infants (P = .09). Only four wheezing infants, all over 1 year old, presented IgE antibodies to inhalant allergens: three to mites and one to mites, dog, and egg; three of these had a reported history of allergy in both mother and father. Both wheezing and control infants presented IgE to foods: 8.9% (6 of 67) and 11.1% (3 of 27) were sensitized to at least one food allergen, respectively (P = .74). The most common allergens were egg and cow's milk, followed by wheat and soy. No sensitization to peanut or fish was found. IgE to Ascaris lumbricoides was not detectable in children under 2 years of age. No signifi- cant differences in peripheral blood eosinophil counts were observed in the wheezing and control groups (GM = 218\/mm 3 and 208\/mm 3 , respectively) (P = .21).\r\n In children older than 2 years, GM value of total IgE was 278 IU\/mL (range, 7.9 to 2627 IU\/mL) in wheezing children and 97.4 IU\/mL (range, 2.0 to 1067 IU\/mL) in control children (P = .002). Sensitization to inhalant allergens was present in 72.4% of wheezing children and 42.8% of control children (P = .005). Mites and cockroach were the sensitizing allergens associated with wheezing. Specific IgE to A lumbricoides was more frequently found in wheezing children, 33.9% (19 of 56) as compared with 14.2% (5 of 35) of the control children (P = .04). Peripheral blood eosinophil counts were higher but did not reach significance (GM = 350\/mm 3 and 199\/mm 3 in wheezing and control children, respectively) (P = .08).\r\n Concentrations of mite, cockroach, cat, and dog allergens in dust samples of homes of wheezing children and control children were compared ( Table I) . Levels of group 2 mite allergens were significantly higher in homes of wheezing children under 2 years of age. Levels of group 1 mite allergens, Bla g 1 and Bla g 2, Fel d 1, and Can f 1, in the homes were not different between wheezing and control children for either age group (Table I) . The highest levels of mite allergens were found in bedding samples.\r\n Infection with respiratory viruses, particularly with RSV, was the major risk factor for wheezing among children younger than 2 years of age, as revealed by univariate analysis. Personal and family history of allergy were both significantly associated with wheezing (Table II) . In the multivariate model, viral infection and family history of allergy were each independently associated with wheezing, and sensitization to inhalant allergens played no significant role in wheezing in infants (Table III) .\r\n Among children 2 to 12 years old, allergy was the most important risk factor for wheezing, indicated by the higher frequency of positive tests for specific IgE to inhalant allergens and elevated total IgE levels (Table II) . IgE to A lumbricoides and personal history of allergy were both associated with wheezing (Table II) . On the other hand, viral infection was not a significant risk factor for wheezing in this age group. Two models of multivariate analysis were generated by using levels of specific IgE antibodies \u2265 0.7 kU A \/L or \u2265 3.5 kU A \/L (considered as high level). In both models, sensitization to inhalant allergens was the major independent risk factor for wheezing (Table IV) .\r\n Current exposure to high levels of indoor allergens was not significantly associated with wheezing ( Table I) . Levels of group 1 mite allergens >10 \u00b5g\/g of dust were found in approximately 70% of the homes of children older than 2 years and in 36% to 46% of the homes of children under 2 years, with no differences between wheezing and control groups. Approximately 25% of homes presented high levels of cockroach allergens in dust samples. In 13 of 172 (7.5%) homes, cats were present in the house. Levels of cat allergen were undetectable or very low in the majority of samples; however, Fel d 1 levels in homes with cats were higher than in those without a cat (GM = 1.06 \u00b5g\/g and 0.19 \u00b5g\/g, P < .0001). The presence of dogs was found in 87 of 172 (50.2%) homes visited, and Can f 1 levels were also higher in homes with dogs as compared with homes without dogs (GM = 6.4 \u00b5g\/g and 0.5 \u00b5g\/g, P < .0001). No synergistic effect was observed when the combination of sensitization and exposure to specific allergens was analyzed.\r\n No association of passive smoke exposure and wheezing was found (Table II) . Breast-feeding for at least 6 months was reported for 21.4% (12 of 56) of wheezing children older than 2 years of age as compared with 31.4% (11 of 35) of control children (P = .28). \r\n In the current study, we have identified for the first time risk factors associated with acute wheezing among children living in a subtropical area of South America. We have found that RSV infection was strongly associated with wheezing among children under 2 years of age. 7, 12 The frequency of RSV was lower than that reported in temperate regions (39% versus 60% to 80%). 7 However, if we consider the subgroup of infants 0 to 6 months old, 61% tested positive for RSV antigen. RSV infections were predominantly found in the months of February to May, corresponding to late summer and early to mid-fall, indicating that the virus occurs in a different seasonal pat-tern as compared with that of the northern hemisphere. The available data indicate that the main age group affected by RSV in developing countries is children under 6 months of age and that in tropical or subtropical climates RSV outbreaks are frequently associated with the rainy season. 23 Household and day care-based prospective studies in coastal northeast Brazil have identified RSV at an unexpectedly low frequency, 0% to 4%. 24, 25 A previous study in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, analyzing samples of 829 children under 5 years of age with nonspecific respiratory tract symptoms seen in the ED revealed that RSV was present in 21.6% of nasal washes. However, the vast majority of RSV infections (157\/188 episodes, 83.5%) were found in children under 1 year of age. 26 Health care delivery and quality \u00a7High-level exposure to mites, cockroach, cat, and dog were defined as group 1 mite allergen levels \u226510 \u00b5g\/g of dust; cockroach allergens Bla g 1 \u22658 U\/g or Bla g 2 \u22650.32 \u00b5g\/g of dust; cat allergen Fel d 1 \u22658 \u00b5g\/g of dust; and dog allergen Can f 1 \u226510 \u00b5g\/g of dust, respectively, at least in one site of the home. n.d., Not done. IgE to food allergens was not assayed on children ages 2 to 12 years; -, odds ratios for variables with a zero value could not be calculated with STATA 6.0. The lack of evidence for association of rhinovirus and wheezing in the current study is striking. It is possible that genetic factors may play a role in determining immunologic responses to rhinovirus in different populations. In addition, rhinovirus serotypes circulating in tropical areas may be different from those in temperate climates, particularly regarding their ability to replicate in the lower respiratory airways. Temperatures in the lower airways may be critical for the intensity of replication, at least for some rhinovirus serotypes. 27 It has been demonstrated that inhalation of cold air results in substantial temperature decrease in the lower airways 28 that may favor rhinovirus replication. In the northern hemisphere, rhinovirus peak prevalence occurs in early fall and late spring and has been associated with new school terms. 29 In subtropical climates, it is possible that higher temperatures year-round may be less conducive to productive growth of rhinovirus. Reduced rhinovirus spread in these areas could, at least in part, be due to the styles of housing peculiar to warmer climates, with homes and schools being ventilated by keeping windows open.\r\n The role of adenovirus in causing wheezing and persistent asthma in children is largely unknown. It has been suggested that latency of adenovirus in infected lung epithelial cells is associated with amplification of cigarette smoke-induced inflammation and may cause allergen-induced eosinophilic inflammation to become steroid resistant. 30 Adenoviruses play an important role as a cause of lower respiratory infections among children in Argentina and Chile, 31, 32 being secondary only to RSV.\r\n Similar to previous studies, 12,33-35 sensitization to inhalant allergens was the major independent risk factor for wheezing among children 2 to 12 years of age, and home exposure to high levels of inhalant allergens was not associated with current wheezing. We have previously reported that mites and cockroach were major causes of sensitization among children with asthma and\/or allergic rhinitis, seen at university-based allergy clinics in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. 36 In the current study, the frequency of allergic sensitization was very high, notably among control children (43% of the children). Part of the reason for finding a higher-than-expect-ed frequency of sensitization among control subjects may be due to the fact that we have not aimed to exclude subjects with allergic rhinitis from the control group. It would be difficult to have a definitive diagnosis of allergic rhinitis among children with respiratory distress at the ED setting. It is possible that some subjects with allergic rhinitis may have been included as control subjects, particularly in the group of children older than 2 years of age.\r\n The relation of asthma and allergy with parasitic infection is controversial. Our studies in children living in poverty in northeast Brazil have shown that current infection with A lumbricoides was an independent risk factor for wheezing, in addition to positive skin tests to inhalant allergens. 37 A study of 2164 children 8 to 18 years of age from China revealed that infection with A lumbricoides was associated with increased risk of asthma and with sensitization to common inhalant allergens. 38 On the other hand, studies in rural Africa point to an inverse correlation between helminthic infections and atopy and asthma. 39 Medeiros et al 40 have recently shown that subjects from a Schistosoma mansoni endemic area in Brazil had lower frequency of skin test positivity to indoor allergens and a milder course of asthma than individuals with asthma not living in an area endemic for S mansoni. In the current study, we have found that IgE antibodies to A lumbricoides were more frequently found in wheezing children than in control children; however, this association was no longer significant after multivariate analysis.\r\n In conclusion, results of the current study have shed light on risk factors associated with acute wheezing in children living in a subtropical environment, an area where the prevalence of asthma is comparable with that in the United States and other developed countries. 41 Wheezing in the prior 12 months, which has been shown to correlate better with diagnosis of asthma in Brazil, 42 was reported in 22.5% and 16.7% of children 6 to 7 years old and 13 to 14 years old, respectively, evaluated by the ISAAC questionnaire. 41 Some of the risk factors for acute wheezing identified in the current study, including RSV infections in the first 2 years of life, are similar to those previously reported in studies carried out in temperate developed countries. Inhalant allergens appear to be a major cause of asthma attacks in this environment, and rhinovirus does not appear to play a remarkable role in triggering asthma symptoms, as previously described in temperate regions.","sha":"03a2f9a8c86cde90a603a64a608290d98fed9aa0","publish_time":"2004-03-31","authors":"Camara, Ataide A; Silva, Jorgete M; Ferriani, Virginia P.L; Tobias, K\u00e1tia R.C; Macedo, Izolete S; Padovani, M\u00e1rcio A; Harsi, Charlotte M; Cardoso, M.Regina A; Chapman, Martin D; Arruda, Eurico; Platts-Mills, Thomas A.E; Arruda, L.Karla","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","doi":"10.1016\/j.jaci.2003.11.027","Title":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","H index":262.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood. 7 It has been definitely established that specific IgE response to RSV is not an important element in the pathogenesis of RSVinduced wheezing 10 ; however, the virus has been shown to induce expression of cytokines and chemokines and activation of monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes, which may influence the mechanisms involved in the development of asthma in children. This has been demonstrated in community-based and emergency department studies. Children with chronic respiratory illnesses (n = 2) (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) and those who reported therapy with corticosteroids within 4 weeks before the ED visit (n = 8) were not included in the study. All children were residents in the city of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto. Wheezing and control children were enrolled every month from October 1998 to June 2000, except for December 1998. A positive family history for allergy was characterized by the report of asthma, rhinitis, and\/or atopic dermatitis diagnosed by a physician in the mother, father, and\/or sibling(s). Nasal washings were collected and processed for detection of respiratory viruses as previously described. Human rhinovirus and coronavirus RNA was detected by RT-PCR. 19 PCR products of 520 to 522 bp and 505 bp in length corresponded to adenovirus subgenera B and C, respectively. Certain adenovirus serotypes including those of subgenus C can be identified in nasal aspirates up to several weeks after acute infection. 21 Measurements of major allergens from mites (group 1 and group 2), cockroach (Bla g 1 and Bla g 2), cat (Fel d 1), and dog (Can f 1) in dust extracts were carried out with the use of monoclonal antibody-based ELISA. 22 Group 1 mite allergens comprised the sum of levels of Der p 1 and Der f 1. Peripheral blood eosinophils and allergen levels in house dust were analyzed by Mann-Whitney test. Univariate and multivariate analysis were carried out by logistic regression, using the software STATA version 6.0. In the group of children under 2 years of age, respiratory viruses were detected in 60.8% (45 of 74) wheezing infants and in 13.3% (4 of 30) control infants (P < .001). Influenza A and B and parainfluenza viruses were not detected (Fig 1) . Five wheezing children were positive for more than one virus. In children under 2 years of age, geometric mean (GM) total IgE levels were 19.7 IU\/mL (range <2 IU\/mL to 1709 IU\/mL) in wheezing infants and 9.4 IU\/mL (range < 2 IU\/mL to 620 IU\/mL) in control infants (P = .09). The most common allergens were egg and cow's milk, followed by wheat and soy. No sensitization to peanut or fish was found. Mites and cockroach were the sensitizing allergens associated with wheezing. The highest levels of mite allergens were found in bedding samples. In the multivariate model, viral infection and family history of allergy were each independently associated with wheezing, and sensitization to inhalant allergens played no significant role in wheezing in infants (Table III) . Levels of cat allergen were undetectable or very low in the majority of samples; however, Fel d 1 levels in homes with cats were higher than in those without a cat (GM = 1.06 \u00b5g\/g and 0.19 \u00b5g\/g, P < .0001). 24, 25 A previous study in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, analyzing samples of 829 children under 5 years of age with nonspecific respiratory tract symptoms seen in the ED revealed that RSV was present in 21.6% of nasal washes. IgE to food allergens was not assayed on children ages 2 to 12 years; -, odds ratios for variables with a zero value could not be calculated with STATA 6.0. The lack of evidence for association of rhinovirus and wheezing in the current study is striking. 29 In subtropical climates, it is possible that higher temperatures year-round may be less conducive to productive growth of rhinovirus. 36 In the current study, the frequency of allergic sensitization was very high, notably among control children (43% of the children).

Diagnosis of COPD is based on meeting the physiologic criteria of fixed obstruction in forced expiratory flows and treatment focus on symptomatic relief, with limited effect on overall prognosis. However, patients with COPD have distinct features that determine very different evolutions of the disease. In this review we highlight distinct subgroups of COPD characterized by unique pathophysiologic derangements, response to treatment, and disease progression. It is likely that identification of subgroups of COPD will lead to discovery of much needed disease-modifying therapeutic approaches.

This hypothesis argued that bronchodilator responsiveness was an overlapping feature shared by various forms of obstructive lung diseases, including asthma. In contrast, the British hypothesis argued that bronchodilator responsiveness in patients with COPD was due to concomitant asthma. 1, 2 In 1959, during the Ciba Guest Symposium, the scientific community began to recognize the problems of poor phenotyping and published an article in Thorax under the title of ''Terminology, definitions, and classification of chronic pulmonary emphysema and related conditions.'' 3 That report stated the following: ''At present, the diagnosis of 'chronic bronchitis,' 'asthma,' and 'emphysema' are used without any general agreement about the clinical conditions to which they refer. Any one (or more) of these words may be used by different clinicians to describe the condition of the same patient. It appears that chronic bronchitis is often used in Great Britain to describe cases that would be called asthma or emphysema in the Unites States.'' Importantly, this remains an ongoing controversy in clinical practice. This blurred vision of disease was represented as a nonproportional Venn diagram of COPD, one of the most famous diagrams in pulmonary medicine. 4 For many years, a unifying view of COPD influenced physicians to take a one-size-fits-all approach to patients with COPD. This was applied to diagnostic approaches in which physicians rely on spirometry with bronchodilator responsiveness, as well as therapeutic management. In these approaches, first-line medications have been applied consistently once COPD is diagnosed without much consideration of possible distinct phenotypes of COPD.\r\n However, several lines of investigation have demonstrated that subgroups of COPD can have distinct pathophysiologic derangements, response to treatment, and disease progression. 5 Thus a precision approach to this disease is needed to overcome the many years of stagnant therapeutic advances by identifying novel treatable traits and treating them at a stage at which disease-modifying approaches are more likely to succeed. 6 This review will focus on the state of the art and knowledge gaps of COPD subpopulations and phenotyping.\r\n COPD is defined by airflow obstruction (postbronchodilator FEV 1 \/forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio <0.7) that is not fully reversible after bronchodilator administration. 7 FEV 1 has been used to quantify and grade obstruction severity. This criterion does not consider the multiplicity of pathophysiologic derangements and heterogeneous histopathologic conditions that lead to airway obstruction. Both decrease in elastic recoil and decrease in cross-sectional airway diameter (independent of [and frequently concomitant with] each other) will lead to an increase in airway resistance during expiration, leading to airflow limitation. 8 This ramification increases further if one considers the multiple molecular derangements that lead to loss of elastic recoil and airway damage. This definition also leaves a large proportion of subjects with physiologic abnormalities, respiratory symptoms, or both that do not reach COPD diagnostic criteria. For example, use of 0.7 as a cut point for FEV 1 \/FVC ratio excludes a significant portion of subjects (many of them with ratios of less than the predictive lower limit of normal values) that have significant symptoms. 9 In addition, the lower limit of normal for FEV 1 \/FVC ratio decreases with age. Thus the accuracy of these diagnostic criteria also changes with age, affecting the establishment of early diagnosis in this disease among younger patients. 10 Furthermore, the use of a fixed cut point might misclassify some older patients as having COPD. Although using the lower limit of normal would be a more desirable parameter, this value is dependent on the reference population and is unlikely to accurately reflect the normality of many different ethnic groups. In addition, FEV 1 normally decreases with age, and the rate of decrease is an important spirometric indicator of disease progression in patients with COPD. However, the rate of lung function decrease is not considered for diagnosing or staging the disease.\r\n The current approach to diagnosis and staging of COPD is based on spirometric values, even though disease is believed generally to begin in the small airways, 8 an area classically labelled as the ''quiet zone'' because it cannot be easily assessed by means of spirometry alone. 11 A large proportion of patients at risk for COPD have significant respiratory symptoms but without the spirometric abnormalities required to meet COPD criteria. Accordingly, there are several forms of smoke-related lung diseases, even with an FEV 1 \/FVC ratio of greater than 0.7, 12 including chronic bronchitis (based on frequency of cough and sputum production), emphysema (based on computed tomography [CT]), small-airway disease (based on specialized lung function or imaging), or asthma (based on symptom characteristics, bronchodilator response, or both). In addition, some patients present with overlap within these broad entities, whereas others do not fit any of the available definitions.\r\n The lack of clear agreement on how to define the above entities has delayed pathophysiologic understanding of these disease states. Several multicenter cohorts have been developed that allow study of these smoke-related lung diseases. Examples include the COPDGene, 13 Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS), 14 Canadian Cohort Obstructive Lung Diseases (canCOLD) study, 15 and the Copenhagen City Heart Study 16 cohorts. Overall, these smoke-related lung diseases are very common, with significant morbidity and possible risk for progression to COPD, as defined by using spirometric criteria. For example, in the COPDGene cohort, smokers without spirometric criteria for COPD have worse health status when assessed by using the St George Respiratory Questionnaire. 17 In the SPIROMICS cohort, respiratory symptoms are present in half of smokers with preserved pulmonary function; when compared with asymptomatic smokers, these symptomatic subjects had greater limitation of physical activity, impaired pulmonary function (although still within the limits considered as normal), and evidence of airway wall thickening on CT imaging of the chest. 9 Importantly, smokers with preserved lung function and respiratory symptoms had higher rates of exacerbations than asymptomatic smokers (COPD Assessment Test [CAT] score <10).\r\n In addition, the coexistence of asthma with other smoke-related lung diseases in subjects that do not fit the spirometric criteria for COPD has significant health implications. For example, coexistence of asthma with chronic bronchitis is associated with poor symptom control and a greater decrease in FEV 1 . 16, 18 The inflammatory changes observed in the airways of smokers with asthma are distinct from hose in never-smokers with asthma. In smokers with asthma, there are fewer eosinophils, increased numbers of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and goblet cell hyperplasia. 19, 20 Of note, there are no clear treatment guidelines for this group of symptomatic smokers who have no spirometric criteria for COPD. However, a large proportion (between 20% and 42%) receive respiratory treatment with inhaled medications, 9, 17 despite data that smokers with asthma might be poorly responsive to corticosteroid therapy. 21 The above considerations indicate that more research is needed to define the phenotypic changes and pathophysiologic derangements of smoke-related lung disease before meeting the spirometric definition for COPD.\r\n In patients with COPD, early pathologic derangements occur in bronchioles less than 2 mm in diameter, followed by parenchymal remodeling, 22, 23 leading to a minimal increase in total lung resistance. The 2-mm cutoff used to define small airways is based on experiments using retrograde catheters inserted into open lungs of dogs performed by Macklem and Mead 11 more than 50 years ago. As such, the physiologic abnormalities occur in a large silent region, and spirometric abnormalities become significant only later in disease development. Direct measurement of the distribution of resistance in the lower respiratory tract has confirmed that the small airways (ie, <2 mm in internal diameter) are the major sites in which obstruction starts in patients with emphysema. 24, 25 Micro-CT of surgical specimens from patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage I COPD further demonstrated airway narrowing and loss of the small conducting airways. 23 Therefore it is not surprising that respiratory symptoms and structural changes in the lung are frequently discordant with spirometric results.\r\n There is an increasing need to consider novel approaches using earlier indicators that would uncover underlying parenchymal and airway injury before meeting spirometric COPD criteria. Examples of such approaches include imaging methods, such as specialized CT methods, 26 and measurements of small-airway physiology, such as the forced oscillation technique. 8 \r\n Newer CT techniques can evaluate changes in lung density between inspiration and expiration to perform parametric response mapping, which suggests differentiation between small-airways disease and emphysema. 27 This methodology demonstrated the widespread presence of functional smallairway disease, even within smokers with GOLD 0 and those with early GOLD 1 COPD, suggesting a role for assessment of small-airway disease in COPD phenotyping. Moreover, additional data have strongly suggested that functional small-airways abnormalities identified by using this technique are associated with rate of FEV 1 decrease. 28 In addition, CT can provide a measure of airway count, a parameter shown recently to be an earlier marker of COPD and associated independently with rapid lung function decrease. 29 Expiratory central airway collapse can be identified by bronchoscopic visualization or expiratory CT and has been suggested to be associated with significant respiratory morbidity. [30] [31] [32] \r\n The forced oscillation technique applies an oscillating signal at the airway opening during tidal breathing and measures changes in flow and pressure to compute the respiratory system impedance that reflects the mechanical properties of the respiratory system. 33 Using mathematic modeling, impedance can be partitioned into resistance and reactance. Resistance reflects predominately the frictional forces related to airflow within the airways. Reactance reflects the elastic properties and inhomogeneities of ventilation across the respiratory system. Higher oscillation frequencies (approximately 20 Hz) reflect large airways, and lower oscillation frequencies (<10 Hz) reflect properties of the entire respiratory system, including the small airways. Thus in the presence of normal forced airflows (as noted by normal FEV 1 and FEV 1 \/ FVC ratio), abnormalities present in low oscillation frequencies can be attributed to small-airway dysfunction.\r\n Based on the above considerations, numerous studies have used the forced oscillation technique to evaluate small-airway function in patients with lower respiratory symptoms after toxic environmental inhalation. 34, 35 Of importance, respiratory symptoms in many of these subjects were unexplained by using routine clinical evaluation because chest radiographs and spirometric measures of airflow and lung volume were within the normal range, despite the presence of new-onset respiratory symptoms. Data demonstrated the presence of small-airways dysfunction despite normal airflow on spirometry. 36, 37 The clinical relevance of the small-airway dysfunction was demonstrated in multiple domains. Smallairway dysfunction was correlated with magnitude of inhaled toxin exposure, development\/severity of respiratory symptoms, response to therapy, presence of systemic inflammation, and histologic abnormalities within the small airways. [38] [39] [40] Additional studies have evaluated the clinical relevance of small-airway assessment in cigarette smoke-induced lung disease. For smokers at risk for COPD (ie, at a time point when airflow remains normal when assessed by means of spirometry), the presence of peripheral airway dysfunction and its response to bronchodilator was correlated with the severity of peripheral lung inflammation. 41 In addition, longitudinal data from patients with established COPD suggest that expiratory flow limitation, as assessed by using the forced oscillation technique, predicts clinically relevant outcomes, including exercise performance, exacerbations, and possibly mortality. 42 Further longitudinal investigations of large cohorts are needed to evaluate the use of these early physiologic markers to both understand the progression to clinically evident COPD and provide insight into mechanisms for disease progression once COPD is established.\r\n Multiple-breath nitrogen washout is another technique used to evaluate small-airway physiology. By using a mathematic model of gas mixing in the lung, one can obtain parameters that described inhomogeneity of gas mixing within the convectiondependent and diffusion-dependent airways. [43] [44] [45] In patients with COPD, physiologic dysfunction of the small airways can be detected by diffusion-dependent airways at early stages, whereas the convection airway physiology (convection-dependent airways) seems to be less affected. 46 In patients with COPD, abnormalities in diffusion capacity can occur as a consequence of either loss of alveolar capillary membrane surface area caused by emphysema and\/or heterogeneity of regional ventilation caused by airway obstruction. 47 In patients with established COPD, the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide is frequently reduced by one or both of these mechanisms. Although distinguishing these phenotypes might be of interest, the relative contribution of airway heterogeneity versus parenchymal destruction is not readily quantifiable, and both mechanisms coexist frequently in an individual patient. Of interest, either of these factors could also produce a reduction in diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide in the presence of normal spirometry, raising the possibility that measurement of diffusion could have a role in early diagnosis. 48, 49 \r\n Multivariable approaches to address disease might provide relevant information that can characterize different subtypes of COPD. These multiple dimensions can include clinical, physiologic, imaging, and endotyping dimensions (Fig 1) . Within each of them, data support the relevance of specific variables to COPD diagnosis and prognosis. Very few and limited combinations of these variables and dimensions have been studied and validated. Examples include questionnaires directed toward understanding symptoms and quality of life, such as CAT scores and St George Respiratory Questionnaire scores. 50, 51 Other approaches combine variables to create indices that correlate with patient outcomes, including body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity (BODE); age, dyspnea, and airflow obstruction (ADO); and dyspnea, airflow obstruction, smoking, and exacerbation (DOSE) indices. [52] [53] [54] As depicted in Fig 1, much less is known about the value of multiple other variables combined from different dimensions for what future investigations are needed to achieve a more holistic view of subjects with COPD to understand relevant subtypes amenable for different therapeutic approaches. Below is the status of the current knowledge showing that identification of COPD subtypes is relevant in this disease.\r\n The recent recognition of the need to characterize COPD phenotypes led to the creation of several large multicenter cohort studies. Although each of these have unique focuses and aims, they all share the premise that a multidimensional approach to evaluating this disease using large multicenter cohorts will help identify distinct phenotypes. Classification into groups of distinct phenotypes can provide pathophysiologic insights that would guide a more precise therapeutic approach and prognostic relevance for clinically meaningful outcomes. Here we propose that although some commonalities can be relevant to understand COPD, identification of distinct subpopulations might lead to a defined taxonomic annotation, with implications for prognosis and treatment (Fig 2) . Below are some of the most commonly cited and known COPD phenotypes and endotypes.\r\n As noted earlier, micro-CT studies have shown that in early stages there is a reduction in total bronchiolar area and a reduction in the number of small conducting airways. 23 The small-airway remodeling observed in patients with COPD is characterized by goblet cell hyperplasia, mucous gland enlargement, peribronchiolar wall infiltration with inflammatory cells, and bronchiolar smooth muscle hypertrophy. 55, 56 Small-airways disease, although characteristic of early stages of COPD, becomes more widespread over time as the disease progresses to more severe COPD. The therapeutic relevance of this phenotype can include use of therapies that allow the small airways to be targeted pharmacologically. 57 a 1 -Antitrypsin deficiency This condition affects less than 5% of patients with COPD and presents in younger subjects compared with the rest of the COPD population. 58 Mutation of the a 1 -antitrypsin gene leads to a much higher risk of COPD in smokers and workers exposed to particulate matter. 59 Homozygous a 1 -antitrypsin deficiency occurs in 1% to 4.5% of patients with COPD, and the heterozygous form, with less severe protein deficiency, occurs in 17.8% of patients with COPD. 60 a 1 -Antitrypsin is a proteinase inhibitor that protects lung tissue from damage by neutrophil elastase. Thus subjects with this condition experience an imbalance between proteinases and antiproteinases, leading to destruction of elastin fibers, which affects the elastic recoil of the lung and results in parenchymal destruction. This imbalance between proteinases and antiproteinases seems to be less evident in patients with other forms of emphysema. The therapeutic relevance of recognizing this phenotype is the benefit observed especially in subjects with severe deficiency through intravenous augmentation with pooled human a 1 -antitrypsin. 61 Emphysema Emphysema occurs in a significant proportion of smokers that might not fit the COPD spirometric criteria. 26 Multiple biological pathways have been implicated in this phenotype. Both macrophage and neutrophil numbers are increased with release of matrix metalloproteinases, elastases, and collagenases that degrade the parenchymal matrix. 62 In addition, parenchymal destruction has been associated with increased apoptosis, probably through downregulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway. 63, 64 Multiple different phenotypes of emphysema have been described, including centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal phenotypes. Some differences can be noted among these phenotypes. For example, the centrilobular phenotype is associated with greater smoking history, whereas the panlobular phenotype is associated with reduced body mass index independently from FEV 1 . 65 Paraseptal emphysema seems to be associated with fewer symptoms and less physiologic impairment. However, it is still not clear what determines the distribution of the emphysema. Careful phenotyping of the anatomic distribution also has important therapeutic implications. This is shown by the survival benefit for lung volume reduction surgery among patients with upper lobe emphysema and low exercise capacity. 66 Similarly, a significant clinical effect can be achieved by means of regional reduction by endobronchial valves based on identification of affected lobes without collateral ventilation. 67 On the basis of a model of the tree of life used to annotate living organisms, we represented our conceptualization of how subpopulations of COPD might be related but differentiated. In this review we proposed the need to define subpopulations of COPD that can share common variables (eg, physiologic and clinical variables) but that also had distinct features (eg, defined airway\/parenchymal abnormalities, specific inflammatory pathways, and\/or dysbiotic microbiota) that lead to a different natural history of disease and potential therapeutic targets.\r\n This phenotype is characterized by chronic cough with sputum production. Prior data suggested this phenotype was associated with a more rapid decrease in lung function and exacerbations. 68, 69 However, analysis of the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points (ECLIPSE) data showed that this phenotype was not independently associated with exacerbations in multivariate analysis. 70 The airway inflammation present in patients with this phenotype is characterized by increased neutrophil, macrophage, and cytotoxic CD8 1 lymphocyte counts. 71 Colonization with potential pathogenic microorganisms leads to further neutrophilic response. 72 In addition, patients with COPD frequently have microaspiration associated with gastroesophageal reflux caused by lack of coordination between breathing and swallowing. [73] [74] [75] Smoking impairs mucociliary clearance and reduces the ability to clear oral microbes from the lower airways, exacerbating inflammation. 76 This leads to chronic cough with progressive incoordination of breathing with swallowing. Therefore it is not surprising that newer culture-independent techniques used to characterize the lower airway microbiota demonstrate the presence of upper airway commensals such as Streptococcus, Prevotella, and Veillonella species. 77 Importantly, this phenotype is associated with greater extent of dyspnea, greater frequency of exacerbations, greater airway obstruction, and increased airway wall thickening. 78 It is also associated with cardiovascular comorbidities and sleep apnea. 79 The clear therapeutic relevance is reflected in the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor roflumilast, which appears to have the greatest clinical benefit in patients with such a clinical phenotype. 80, 81 Frequent exacerbators Frequent exacerbators are a group of subjects with 2 or more exacerbations per year. 70, 82 Although recent data suggest that the frequent exacerbator phenotype is quite infrequent in a large cohort study, this phenotype seems to be quite stable over time because the best predictor for exacerbations is past history of exacerbations. 83 Other circulating biomarkers have been examined as part of the SPIROMICS and COPDGene cohorts to characterize this phenotype, and except for high levels of decorin and a 2 -macroglobulin, none have proved to be robust enough to be replicated across cohorts. 84 Interestingly, gastroesophageal reflux has been suggested by one group to be associated independently with exacerbations, suggesting that chemical and\/or microbial challenge, as a result of microaspiration, can contribute to development of this phenotype. 70 During the course of a COPD exacerbation, two thirds of patients have bacteria, viruses, or both cultured from lower airway secretions, in which aerobic bacteria are isolated in half of patients, respiratory viruses are isolated in one third, and bacterial\/viral coinfection is present in one fourth. 85, 86 Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the bacterial pathogens most commonly isolated during COPD exacerbations. Acquisition of a new bacterial strain commonly precede exacerbations. [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] Among viruses, rhinovirus is the virus most frequently associated with exacerbations, 85, 92, 93 whereas coronavirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, influenza virus, and human metapneumovirus are less prevalent. 92, 94 Coinfections with viruses and bacteria produce higher bacterial burden, more sputum eosinophils, greater lung function impairment, and longer hospitalization. 85, 94 This vicious cycle could explain the association of poor oral health, increased airway bacterial load, COPD exacerbations, and reduced lung function. [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] Overall, frequent exacerbators generally experience more severe airway obstruction, as well as other multisystem parameters for evaluation of disease severity (eg, the Medical Research Council dyspnea scale and the body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise index). 100 In addition, exacerbations are particularly important because they are associated with accelerated lung function decrease and have a negative effect on quality of life and mortality. 101 Each exacerbation has negative short-and long-term effects on patients with COPD, including psychological effects. 102 The therapeutic relevance of the recognition of this phenotype is highlighted by multiple trials showing that inhaled steroids and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors provide therapeutic benefit in patients with this phenotype. 80, 103, 104 In addition, macrolides, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin, are effective at reducing exacerbations and hospitalizations. [105] [106] [107] [108] Macrolides have direct anti-inflammatory effects, with data showing that they decrease proinflammatory cytokine production, adhesion molecule levels, and reactive oxygen species levels. 109, 110 However, the mechanisms for the beneficial effects of macrolides can go beyond their direct anti-inflammatory effect because newer data showed that they also induce changes in the lower airway microbiota with increased production of bacterial metabolites with anti-inflammatory properties. 111\r\n According to both GOLD and the Global Initiative for Asthma, asthma-COPD overlap is ''characterized by persistent airflow limitation with several features usually associated with asthma and several features usually associated with COPD.'' 7, 112 This concept remains quite controversial. [113] [114] [115] In asthmatic patients the classical pathophysiologic derangements described are inflammation of the large airways with a T H 2 phenotype and eosinophilic inflammation. 116 In contrast, airway inflammation in patients with COPD occurs initially in the small airways and is characterized by neutrophilic inflammation and inflammation with CD8 lymphocytes. 116 However, although these 2 phenotypes seem quite distinct, there is increasing awareness of the involvement of the small airways and non-T H 2 type of inflammation in asthma, as well as involvement of the large airways and eosinophils in patients with COPD. In asthmatic patients irreversible airway obstruction with airway remodeling occurs as disease progresses, whereas in patients with COPD, bronchodilator response to b 2 -agonist occurs in approximately 45% of patients with COPD 117 and might be less common with an emphysema-dominant phenotype. 118 Genetic variation of the b 2 -adrenergic receptor might explain why some patients with COPD have better response to this type of drug. 119 Although the relevance of identification of this phenotype is still unclear, airway hyperresponsiveness has been associated with lung function decrease. 5 Furthermore, patients with asthma-COPD overlap have more severe disease burden when compared with other patients with COPD. 120 The implications of this phenotype in the current therapeutic approach likely involve better understanding of the endotype, 121 and this is an area of active investigation for the use of biologics (eg, anti-IgE and anti-IL-5). 122 For now, both GOLD and the Global Initiative for Asthma recommend treatment of asthma-COPD overlap according to the most dominant phenotype. 7, 112 Table I describes some of the differences and similarities between these subtypes of COPD and asthma.\r\n Eosinophilic airway inflammation has been described in approximately 15% to 40% of patients with COPD. 123 In patients with low blood eosinophil counts (<340 cells\/mL), inflammation tend to remain stable, whereas in those with high eosinophil counts, levels tend to fluctuate over time. 124 Importantly, during exacerbations, there is an increase in eosinophil numbers in sputum. 125 The highly eosinophilic phenotype has been proposed to be associated with the patient's responsiveness to corticosteroids during both acute exacerbations and stable disease. [126] [127] [128] [129] In addition, a meta-analysis that included 10 large trials suggested that use of corticosteroids in patients with low eosinophil counts (<2%) was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia. 130 The value of blood eosinophil counts has been questioned in the presence of significant emphysema (defined as >15% of pulmonary parenchyma affected in a high-resolution CT scan). 131 Data suggest that this phenotype is characterized by low eosinophil counts, with no significant association with exacerbation phenotype. It is possible that the presence of high eosinophil counts represents a biomarker of a distinct host endotype with predominance of a T H 2 phenotype and thus more responsive to corticosteroids. 132 However, eosinophil counts vary across compartments. For example, blood eosinophil counts do not correlate with levels present in the airways or lung parenchyma in smokers with and without COPD. 133 More recent data have questioned the value of using eosinophils as a biomarker. [133] [134] [135] In the Effect of Indacaterol Glycopyronium Vs. Fluticasone Salmeterol on COPD Exacerbations (FLAME) trial, the therapeutic response to a combination of a secondgeneration long-acting b-agonist (indacaterol) and long-acting muscarinic agonist (glycopyrronium) was similar to that to a combination of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting b-agonist (fluticasone\/salmeterol), even in the predefined group of subjects with high blood eosinophil counts. Mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 agent that affects proliferation, differentiation, and migration of eosinophils, was evaluated recently in patients with COPD, showing no significant differences in the annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations. 136 However, in a subgroup of patients with defined blood eosinophil counts (> _150 cells\/mm 3 at screening or > _300\/ mm 3 during the previous year), a dose of 100 mg of mepolizumab (but not 300 mg) was associated with a small but statistically significant lower annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations. Whether eosinophil levels alone are sufficient as biomarkers to identify a treatable distinct trait of COPD requires further longitudinal investigation. 137 Phenotyping beyond the lungs: Role of the comorbidome Patients with COPD experience a high prevalence of other nonpulmonary conditions. 138 This is important because approximately two thirds of patients with COPD die from these other diseases, and comorbidities have a significant effect on COPD. [139] [140] [141] Recent investigations using network analysis of comorbidities in patients with COPD reveals the presence of hubs of comorbid conditions highly associated with this disease beyond lung cancer and cardiovascular disease, in which common pathophysiologic pathways have been more clearly established. 142 For example, COPD was found to be associated with behavioral risk factors (eg, substance abuse), hepatitis, and pancreatitis. The relevance of identifying these subpopulations of patients with COPD is that it might lead to therapeutic interventions targeting the nonpulmonary comorbidity, with a significant effect on patients' health.\r\n Although here we outlined some more or less well-defined subtypes, much is unknown about how to stratify and taxonomically annotate subtypes of COPD. Table II depicts some of the still unanswered questions that we foresee as a focus for future investigations. It is possible that COPD represents more of a syndrome rather than a defined disease entity, and we are at a point of redefining what this means. By enclosing different entities under the umbrella of COPD, we are committing our pathophysiologic investigations and therapeutic discoveries to fail because of multiple confounders. This is now increasingly accepted in asthmatic patients, in whom relabeling asthma and identification of treatable traits is at the forefront of current investigations. [143] [144] [145] In patients with COPD, it is clear that novel endotyping approaches combined with small-airways physiologic evaluation and imaging are needed to define these different subpopulations of COPD. In addition, multidimensional systembased approaches that integrate symptoms, pulmonary function (beyond FEV 1 ), imaging, microbiology, and immunology profiling should provide a holistic view of this heterogeneous disease.\r\n As our ability to understand how these multiple variables help define subgroups of COPD, we will need a tailored precision medicine approach. [146] [147] [148] These distinct clusters of COPD phenotype will likely lead to identification of new drug targets, as well as new end points for clinical trials.\r\n What do we know? d COPD is a heterogeneous disease in which we are starting to recognize distinct phenotypes associated with different prognosis and potential therapeutic targets.\r\n d Different pathophysiologic derangements lead to the physiologic abnormalities that define COPD.\r\n What is still unknown? d A biomarker approach that would identify subjects at higher risk for progression d Well-defined treatable traits for each subgroup of COPD","sha":"99f8fe83ec882a7dd8dc34c703efe186e175c9d6","publish_time":"2018-06-30","authors":"Segal, Leopoldo N.; Martinez, Fernando J.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","doi":"10.1016\/j.jaci.2018.02.035","Title":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","H index":262.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"CAT: COPD Assessment Test COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease CT: Computed tomography FLAME: Effect of Indacaterol Glycopyronium Vs.

Any one (or more) of these words may be used by different clinicians to describe the condition of the same patient. Importantly, this remains an ongoing controversy in clinical practice. This criterion does not consider the multiplicity of pathophysiologic derangements and heterogeneous histopathologic conditions that lead to airway obstruction. 9 In addition, the lower limit of normal for FEV 1 \/FVC ratio decreases with age. Thus the accuracy of these diagnostic criteria also changes with age, affecting the establishment of early diagnosis in this disease among younger patients. 17 In the SPIROMICS cohort, respiratory symptoms are present in half of smokers with preserved pulmonary function; when compared with asymptomatic smokers, these symptomatic subjects had greater limitation of physical activity, impaired pulmonary function (although still within the limits considered as normal), and evidence of airway wall thickening on CT imaging of the chest. In addition, the coexistence of asthma with other smoke-related lung diseases in subjects that do not fit the spirometric criteria for COPD has significant health implications. For example, coexistence of asthma with chronic bronchitis is associated with poor symptom control and a greater decrease in FEV 1 . In smokers with asthma, there are fewer eosinophils, increased numbers of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and goblet cell hyperplasia. 21 The above considerations indicate that more research is needed to define the phenotypic changes and pathophysiologic derangements of smoke-related lung disease before meeting the spirometric definition for COPD. In patients with COPD, early pathologic derangements occur in bronchioles less than 2 mm in diameter, followed by parenchymal remodeling, 22, 23 leading to a minimal increase in total lung resistance. There is an increasing need to consider novel approaches using earlier indicators that would uncover underlying parenchymal and airway injury before meeting spirometric COPD criteria. 8 \r\n Newer CT techniques can evaluate changes in lung density between inspiration and expiration to perform parametric response mapping, which suggests differentiation between small-airways disease and emphysema. 33 Using mathematic modeling, impedance can be partitioned into resistance and reactance. Resistance reflects predominately the frictional forces related to airflow within the airways. Based on the above considerations, numerous studies have used the forced oscillation technique to evaluate small-airway function in patients with lower respiratory symptoms after toxic environmental inhalation. 43] [44] [45] In patients with COPD, physiologic dysfunction of the small airways can be detected by diffusion-dependent airways at early stages, whereas the convection airway physiology (convection-dependent airways) seems to be less affected. Very few and limited combinations of these variables and dimensions have been studied and validated. Examples include questionnaires directed toward understanding symptoms and quality of life, such as CAT scores and St George Respiratory Questionnaire scores. 52] [53] [54] As depicted in Fig 1, much less is known about the value of multiple other variables combined from different dimensions for what future investigations are needed to achieve a more holistic view of subjects with COPD to understand relevant subtypes amenable for different therapeutic approaches. Below is the status of the current knowledge showing that identification of COPD subtypes is relevant in this disease. Below are some of the most commonly cited and known COPD phenotypes and endotypes. As noted earlier, micro-CT studies have shown that in early stages there is a reduction in total bronchiolar area and a reduction in the number of small conducting airways. 57 a 1 -Antitrypsin deficiency This condition affects less than 5% of patients with COPD and presents in younger subjects compared with the rest of the COPD population. 58 Mutation of the a 1 -antitrypsin gene leads to a much higher risk of COPD in smokers and workers exposed to particulate matter. 60 a 1 -Antitrypsin is a proteinase inhibitor that protects lung tissue from damage by neutrophil elastase. Some differences can be noted among these phenotypes. However, it is still not clear what determines the distribution of the emphysema. Careful phenotyping of the anatomic distribution also has important therapeutic implications. This phenotype is characterized by chronic cough with sputum production. Therefore it is not surprising that newer culture-independent techniques used to characterize the lower airway microbiota demonstrate the presence of upper airway commensals such as Streptococcus, Prevotella, and Veillonella species. 70, 82 Although recent data suggest that the frequent exacerbator phenotype is quite infrequent in a large cohort study, this phenotype seems to be quite stable over time because the best predictor for exacerbations is past history of exacerbations. Acquisition of a new bacterial strain commonly precede exacerbations. [ 92, 94 Coinfections with viruses and bacteria produce higher bacterial burden, more sputum eosinophils, greater lung function impairment, and longer hospitalization. 95] [96] [97] [98] [99] Overall, frequent exacerbators generally experience more severe airway obstruction, as well as other multisystem parameters for evaluation of disease severity (eg, the Medical Research Council dyspnea scale and the body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise index). 111\r\n According to both GOLD and the Global Initiative for Asthma, asthma-COPD overlap is ''characterized by persistent airflow limitation with several features usually associated with asthma and several features usually associated with COPD.'' 7, 112 This concept remains quite controversial. [ 119 Although the relevance of identification of this phenotype is still unclear, airway hyperresponsiveness has been associated with lung function decrease. 125 The highly eosinophilic phenotype has been proposed to be associated with the patient's responsiveness to corticosteroids during both acute exacerbations and stable disease. [ 133] [134] [135] In the Effect of Indacaterol Glycopyronium Vs.

(J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010;125:S95-102.)","text_body":"Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder that is characterized by variable airflow obstruction, airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, and reversibility either spontaneously or as a result of treatment. Multiple etiologies no doubt exist for both its inception and symptom exacerbation once the disease is established. Factors underlying inception can range from viral respiratory tract infections in infancy 1,2 to occupational exposures in adults. 3 Factors underlying asthma exacerbations include allergen exposure in sensitized individuals, viral infections, exercise, irritants, and ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, among others. Exacerbating factors can include one or all of these exposures and vary both among and within patients. Asthma treatment is determined to a large extent after an initial assessment of severity and subsequent establishment of control, both of which can be variable over time and assessed in 2 domains: impairment (current) and risk (long-term consequences). 4 Unfortunately, despite the availability of effective therapies, suboptimal asthma control exists in many patients on a worldwide basis. 5 The future development of novel therapies and treatment paradigms should address these disparities.\r\n For many asthmatic subjects, the disease has its roots during infancy and early childhood. Viral respiratory tract infections produce wheezing episodes during the first 3 years of life in about 50% of children. 6 Some of these children will stop wheezing (transient wheezers), whereas others will go on to have persistent symptoms that will either dissipate before adolescence (primarily nonatopic subjects) or continue into adolescence (atopic wheezers). 7 Once in remission, the disease process might remain quiescent, or the subject could relapse in later life. 8, 9 The phenotype of severe asthma has also been recently well described. 10 The pattern and rate of loss of lung function in asthmatic subjects has been of interest and concern for many investigators. A number of groups have reported that the greatest absolute loss of lung function appears to occur very early in childhood. 8, 11, 12 Some have reported that the peak in lung function that is achieved at about 20 years of age in asthmatic subjects can be decreased 13 and that the rate of further loss during adulthood can be increased in asthmatic subjects. 14 About one fourth of children with asthma might experience greater rates of loss of lung function, and these children have certain phenotypic characteristics: younger age, male sex, higher postbronchodilator FEV 1 percent predicted, and greater airway eosinophilic inflammation. 15 Molecular and cellular mechanisms in asthma Children. The performance of invasive procedures in children to evaluate molecular and cellular mechanisms in asthma is obviously not as feasible from a variety of standpoints compared with adults. However, a few carefully and safely conducted studies in young children have provided insights into possible pathophysiologic features as they relate to developmental milestones and disease expression. When bronchoalveolar lavage has been performed in young wheezing children, a 3-fold increase in total cells, most significantly lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear cells, and macrophages\/monocytes, compared with counts seen in healthy children has been noted. In addition, levels of leukotriene B 4 and C 4 , prostaglandin E 2 , and the potentially epitheliumderived 15-hydroxyeicosattetranoic acid were all increased. 16 Several bronchial biopsy studies have been performed in children. In 53 infants with reversible airflow obstruction evaluated for severe wheezing or cough, bronchial biopsy specimens demonstrated no reticular basement membrane (RBM) thickening or the eosinophilic inflammation characteristic of asthma in older children and adults, even in the presence of atopic characteristics. 17 Conversely, children younger than 6 years with asthma had increased epithelial loss, basement membrane thickening, and eosinophilia compared with control subjects of the same age. However, similar pathologic changes were seen in atopic children without asthma. 18 Taken together, it appears that the inflammatory and structural changes associated with asthma occur sometime after infancy during the early preschool years, when children experience more persistent symptoms of airway dysfunction.\r\n In older children 6 to 16 years of age with difficult asthma receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), RBM thickening to a similar extent to that seen in adult asthmatic subjects has been demonstrated. 19 Additionally, there was no association with RBM thickening and age, symptom duration, lung function, or concurrent eosinophilic airway inflammation. However, unlike adults with asthma, no relationship was observed between RBM thickness and bronchial wall thickening on high-resolution computed tomographic scanning in children with difficult asthma. 20 Finally, persistent airflow obstruction has been associated with a greater density of CD4 1 T lymphocytes in endobronchial biopsy specimens in 27 school-aged children with difficult asthma after treatment with systemic corticosteroids compared with that seen in control subjects. 21 A number of biomarkers have been evaluated to avoid the invasive procedures of bronchial lavage, biopsy, or both in children. Exhaled nitric oxide might be useful as a diagnostic tool and in ongoing management of children with asthma. Exhaled nitric oxide levels have been demonstrated to differentiate young children with asthma from those without, 22 to identify children who are likely to respond to ICSs, 23 and to predict those children who will experience an asthma relapse after reduction of ICSs. 24 However, recent data indicate that when fraction of exhaled nitric oxide monitoring is used in conjunction with a National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines-based asthma management program, it might result in excessive ICS dosing without any significant gains in achieving or maintaining asthma control. 25 Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is obtained by cooling exhaled air and is believed to reflect the contents of the airway lining fluid. 26 Hydrogen peroxide, isoprostanes, aldehydes, and nitrotyrosine are considered markers of oxidative stress, and their levels are increased in the EBC of children with asthma, suggesting an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants. Conversely, levels of glutathione, a protective lung antioxidant, are decreased in children with acute asthma, suggesting a reduced antioxidant capacity. 27 Levels of the inflammatory mediators cysteinyl leukotrienes are increased in the EBC of children with atopic asthma, even while receiving corticosteroid treatment. 28 Finally, airway pH balance might have a role in asthma because a reduced EBC pH has been reported in children with acute or stable asthma. 26 Levels of several other mediators of inflammatory cells have been found to be significantly higher in very young children with asthma, including the number of blood eosinophils, serum eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and urinary eosinophil-derived neurotoxin. 29 In addition, both increased eosinophil cationic protein and cysteinyl leukotriene levels 30 have been obtained from nasal washings in wheezing children less than 2 years of age.\r\n Adults. Asthma for most, but not all, patients begins in early life. As noted above, the cellular and molecular patterns associated with airway inflammation in asthma are complex, interactive, redundant, and variable. 31 In adults, particularly those with established longstanding disease, the factors that contribute to the pathophysiology of airway abnormalities are dependent on the phases of asthma, such as acute, persistent, severe versus nonsevere, or during treatment.\r\n An understanding of the immunopathology of airways in asthma has been markedly advanced with the use of bronchoscopy and biopsy. These airway samples can then be analyzed by using histologic and immunologic methods, and the identified features can be evaluated in relationship to clinical features of asthma to more fully understand the contribution of cellular and molecular events to the resulting physiology and response to treatment. 32 In addition, it is now appreciated that the regulation of airway inflammation is distinct in different phases of asthma (ie, early-onset disease largely related to allergic inflammation and in the persistent or chronic phase of the disease). 33 It is helpful to arbitrarily consider asthma in terms of the traditional T H 2 inflammatory processes and the more chronic inflammatory phase, in which resident airway cells assume the more dominant component contributing to airway dysfunction (Fig 1) , 33 to appreciate the immunopathogenetic mechanisms associated with different phases of asthma.\r\n In the acute inflammatory aspects of asthma, allergen-IgEdirected processes are predominant features of airway pathology, with mast cells, T H 2 lymphocytes, and eosinophils the predominant histologic features. 32 The cytokine network associated with these processes often includes IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13. 34 Mast cells are important contributors both to the initiation of asthma with release of acute-phase mediators, including cysteinyl leukotrienes, and also inflammatory cytokines, which serve to perpetuate inflammatory events in the airway. 35 Subpopulations of lymphocytes polarized toward a T H 2 profile further the inflammatory process by release of cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. It is these factors that serve to drive inflammation (eg, recruitment of eosinophils) and also regulate IgE production. 32 Eosinophils are a characteristic feature of allergic inflammation. 32 The biology of eosinophils is well designed to cause airway inflammation, enhancement of airway hyperresponsiveness, and airflow obstruction. Eosinophils are recruited to the airway in asthmatic subjects by families of cytokines, and chemokines (eg, IL-5, RANTES, and eotaxin) undergo cell activation through processes not fully identified and release highly inflammatory granule-associated substances, the actions of which injure the airway and cause persistent inflammation. Eosinophils are also a rich source for leukotrienes, products of oxidative metabolism, and inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. 36 Although the eosinophil is a prominent feature of airway pathology in asthmatic subjects, its precise contribution to airway pathophysiology is undergoing re-evaluation.\r\n The pattern of airway injury in patients with chronic asthma tends to be more variable, with a shift in the histologic picture toward resident cells of the airway as the more likely cause of persistent disease. In some patients there will be a progressive decrease in lung function and the development of chronic irreversible changes in lung function with their asthma. Although these changes likely have their origins at the onset of asthma, many questions remain as to who is at risk for airway remodeling, when this process begins, and what factors regulate the transition from acute to chronic inflammation. The recognition of progressive loss of lung function in asthmatic subjects has led to a renewed interest in the role of resident airway cells in persistent inflammation.\r\n The airway epithelium is both a target and contributor of persistent inflammatory airway changes in asthmatic subjects. 37 Histologic evaluation of airways in asthmatic subjects, particularly those with more severe disease, reveals injury to epithelium and often a loss of these cells. Epithelial cells are also a rich source of inflammatory mediators and growth factors. In addition, airway smooth muscle often shows hypertrophic and hyperplastic changes in subjects with persistent severe asthma. Moreover, the airway smooth muscle can be a source of both inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. 38 There are other airway cells involved in asthma histopathology, including mucous glands and blood vessels. In subjects with asthma, mucous glands hypertrophy occurs. Activation of these cells leads to the release of mucus to occlude airways and, in severe exacerbations, to become the principal cause for resistance to treatment. Many factors generated in asthma (ie, vascular endothelial growth factor) can act on airway vessels to cause proliferation and, as a process, narrow the airways.\r\n Understanding that heterogeneity exists in the pattern of airway inflammation and the likely molecular factors regulating these processes explains why current therapy is not effective in all subjects with asthma. As the phenotypic features of asthma unfold and with them a recognition of the associated cellular and molecular events, a more specific approach to treatment will follow accompanied by improved control of disease.\r\n Risk factors in relationship to asthma have been evaluated in the context of disease inception (eg, viral infections 1,2,39 ), environmental exposures (eg, aeroallergens, 40 pollution, [41] [42] [43] and tobacco smoke) [44] [45] [46] [47] and lifestyle (eg, living on a farm, 48 diet, 49 and antibiotic use 50 ), comorbid conditions (eg, atopic dermatitis 51 and obesity 52 ) , and occupational exposures, 3 among others, as well as disease severity (as defined by the risk domain, which is discussed subsequently; hospitalizations, 53, 54 frequency and severity of exacerbations, 55 and loss of lung function 8, 56 ). Genetic factors also contribute significantly to disease expression and severity. Asthma is genetically classified as a complex disorder; as such, it does not follow simple Mendelian inheritance characteristics. Hundreds of genetic association studies on asthma-related phenotypes have been conducted in different populations; these have been recently reviewed. 57 Although the importance of gene-environment interactions in the expression of disease has recently been highlighted, 58 the complexities involved in analyzing these relationships from a functional perspective have proved challenging. 59 Recent pharmacogenetic evaluations in relationship to chronic b-agonist use 60 and corticosteroid efficacy have provided new insights into the variability of response in asthmatic patients.\r\n Allergens. Allergen exposure is important in host allergic sensitization and as a common precipitant of asthmatic symptoms in both children and adults. The formation of antigen-specific IgE antibody to aeroallergens (eg, mites, trees, grasses, and animal dander)-the development of allergic sensitization but not necessarily of allergic disease-does not usually occur until 2 to 3 years of life. Thus aeroallergen-induced asthma is uncommon during the first year of life, begins to increase in prevalence during later childhood and adolescence, and peaks in the second decade of life. Once established in genetically predisposed individuals, IgE-mediated reactions are a major contributor both to acute asthmatic symptoms and chronic airway inflammation. Chronic low-level exposure to indoor allergens, dust mite and cockroach in particular, might play a major role in both asthma inception and subsequent provocation of symptoms. 61 Although a wide variety of inhaled allergens can provoke asthma symptoms, sensitization to house dust mite, 62 cockroach, 63 Alternaria species, 64 and possibly cat 40 are important in the pathogenesis of asthma. Dog, but not cat, ownership during infancy has been shown to reduce the subsequent development of allergic sensitization and atopic dermatitis 65 ; numbers of pets and not the type of furred pet might also reduce future risk. 66 These diverse findings indicate that these relationships are indeed complex and might involve gene-environment interactions. Pollen immunotherapy in school-aged children with only allergic rhinitis at the start of treatment has been demonstrated to reduce significantly the subsequent risk of the development of airway hyperresponsiveness and asthma. 67 Infections. Respiratory tract infections caused by viruses, 1,68,69 Chlamydia species, 70 and Mycoplasma species 70 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. Of these respiratory pathogens, viruses have been demonstrated to be epidemiologically associated with asthma in at least 3 ways.\r\n First, during infancy, certain viruses have been implicated as potentially being responsible for the inception of the asthmatic phenotype. The viruses most convincingly demonstrated in this regard have been rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 1, 2 The propensity to respond to these infections differently in persons destined to have asthma might be due to aberrations in innate immune responses, epithelial cell barrier alterations that enhance viral replication, and potentially increased virulence of pathogenic viral strains. However, because nearly every child has been infected at least once with this virus by 2 years of age, additional genetic, environmental, or developmental factors must contribute to the propensity of RSV to be epidemiologically linked with childhood asthma.\r\n Second, in patients with established asthma, particularly children, viral upper respiratory tract infections play a significant role in producing acute exacerbations of airway obstruction that might result in frequent outpatient visits or hospitalizations. 1, 71 Rhinovirus, the common cold virus, is the most frequent cause of exacerbations, but other viruses, including parainfluenza, RSV, influenza, and coronavirus, also have been implicated, albeit to a lesser extent. The increased tendency for viral infections to produce lower airway symptoms in asthmatic subjects might be related, at least in part, to interactions among allergic sensitization, allergen exposure, and viral infections acting as cofactors in the induction of acute episodes of airflow obstruction. 72, 73 Abnormalities in the innate immune response that would prevent viral replication in airway epithelial cells from asthmatic subjects have recently been demonstrated. 68 Third, and paradoxically, infections have been considered to have the potential of actually preventing the development of allergic respiratory tract diseases, including asthma. Interest in this area increased after the advancement of the hygiene hypothesis, 74 which proposed that increasing family size coincident with an increased number of infections might protect against these developments. Based on a progressively broader interpretation of this initial hypothesis, 75 a number of other epidemiologic (eg, living on a farm 76 and early pathologic bacterial colonization of the airway 77 ) and biologic (eg, probiotics 78 ) factors have been evaluated regarding their ability to influence the development of allergic sensitization, asthma, or both.\r\n For infections with other microbial agents, recent attention has focused on Chlamydia and Mycoplasma species as potential contributors to both exacerbations and the severity of chronic asthma in terms of loss of lung function or medication requirements. 70 Finally, infections involving the upper airways (ie, sinusitis) have been considered to contribute to asthma control instability, evoking the concept of a unified airway in relationship to inflammatory responses and alterations in airway physiology.\r\n Exercise. Exercise is one of the more common precipitants of airway obstruction in asthmatic subjects. 79 The symptoms of exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) can include any or all of the following: wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath and, in children, chest pain or discomfort. The symptoms are most intense for 5 to 10 minutes and usually resolve within 15 to 30 minutes after exercise cessation. Under most circumstances, the degree of bronchoconstriction is rarely severe enough to be lifethreatening, and such a situation almost invariably reflects advanced untreated disease, confounding triggering factors (ie, concomitant allergen or irritant exposure), or both. Objective documentation of airflow obstruction after an exercise challenge test (15% decrease in FEV 1 ; 10% if symptoms accompany the decrease in FEV 1 ) 79 or a convincing history with an appropriate response to prophylactic or rescue medication is required to make the diagnosis of EIB. Exercise challenge testing, particularly in elite athletes, 80 must be of sufficient intensity and duration to be able to accurately diagnose the condition, keeping in mind that such confounding problems as vocal cord dysfunction might need to be considered in the differential diagnosis. 81 The pathophysiology of EIB can involve exaggerated responses to heat and water loss and the release of inflammatory mediators as a consequence of these thermodynamic alterations. 82 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Approximately 5% to 10% of adult asthmatic patients will have an acute worsening of symptoms to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 83 The aspirin triad, asthma, nasal polyps, and aspirin sensitivity, is usually found in adult asthmatic patients. The response to aspirin or other NSAIDs begins within an hour of aspirin ingestion and is associated with profound rhinorrhea, eye lacrimation, and, potentially, severe bronchospasm. Patients sensitive to aspirin usually are reactive to all other NSAIDs, and variations in the frequency and severity of adverse responses appear to depend on the potency of each drug within this class of compounds to inhibit the activity of the COX-1 enzyme. 83 The sensitivity to NSAIDs is not IgE mediated but involves the modulation of eicosanoid production. It has been suggested that NSAIDs act by reducing the formation of prostaglandins, which help maintain normal airway function, while increasing the formation of asthma-provoking eicosanoids, including hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids and large quantities of cysteinyl leukotrienes. 83 In addition, there is evidence that mast cell activation occurs, and its mediators can be detected in nasal secretions during an episode of aspirin-induced asthma. 84 This syndrome should be of concern in any asthmatic subject with nasal polyposis, chronic sinusitis, and eosinophilia, although the polyposis and sinusitis might precede the onset of recognized NSAID sensitivity by years.\r\n Aspirin desensitization is available for the aspirin-sensitive patient who might need anti-inflammatory treatment or for use in patients with ischemic heart disease. In patients with aspirininduced asthma, desensitization with aspirin has proved beneficial in improved asthma control, as well as improved sense of smell, reduced purulent sinus infections, and need for further polyp surgery. 85, 86 Gastroesophageal reflux. The true incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in asthmatic subjects and as a causative factor in disease severity has yet to be established. However, it has been estimated that as many as 45% to 65% of adults and children with asthma have GERD. The mechanisms by which GERD affects asthma are also not established but might include microaspiration or irritation of the esophagus with reflux bronchospasm. Although often asymptomatic in its presentation, many patients have nighttime exacerbations or difficult-to-control symptoms. Confirmation of the importance of GERD to asthma often requires endoscopy and 24-hour monitoring of intraesophageal pH levels with concomitant measures of peak expiratory flow rates.\r\n A number of clinical trials have begun to evaluate the effect of suppressing acid reflux on asthma symptoms. A systematic review of 12 small trials of proton-pump inhibitors used in asthma showed an improvement in asthma-related outcomes, but many studies had design flaws and variability in their outcomes. 87 In one study with patients experiencing nocturnal symptoms and symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux, comparisons were made between placebo and 40 mg of esomeprazole twice daily. 88 Improvements in peak flow were noted but not in FEV 1 , rescue inhaler use, or nocturnal awakenings. Finally, the American Lung Association-Asthma Clinical Research Center evaluated 40 mg of esomeprazole twice daily versus placebo in subjects who were asymptomatic for acid reflux disease but had documented acid reflux in 40% of the subjects. Proton-pump inhibitors had no significant effect on a variety of asthma outcomes. 89 These studies suggest that treatment of acid reflux is beneficial, but improvement in symptoms from this condition had no effect on asthma outcomes.\r\n Psychosocial factors. The role of psychosocial factors, or ''stress,'' has undergone an important re-evaluation both in terms of a disease risk factor and a concomitant component of severity. Evidence has shown that parental stress is a risk factor for asthma expression in some children. 90 The mechanisms by which this occurs have not been defined but might include the promotion of allergic inflammation. For example, Liu et al 91 found stress from final examinations to enhance eosinophil recruitment to the airway after an antigen inhalation challenge. Chen et al 92 evaluated the influence of socioeconomic status, which they related to stress, on cytokine generation. With peripheral blood cells from asthmatic subjects but not healthy control subjects, lower socioeconomic status was associated with greater generation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-5 and IL-13. These data are a further indication that stress can, in asthmatic subjects, promote an inflammatory profile. Recent work has also demonstrated dose-response-type relationships between panic and asthma and bidirectional longitudinal associations between the 2 conditions. 93\r\n Although a number of research groups are investigating strategies aimed at asthma prevention, 94,95 this goal has not yet been achieved. Therefore therapy at present is directed primarily at achieving optimal control while attempting to minimize both short-and long-term side effects from any therapeutic intervention. Asthma control is defined by an understanding of the patient's asthma severity, which can be viewed in 2 domains: impairment and risk. Impairment is an evaluation of the concurrent degree of control in achieving the following: minimal (or none) chronic symptoms, including nocturnal awakenings caused by asthma; minimal (or none) need for acute rescue therapy, such as inhaled b 2 -agonists; establishment of a normal lifestyle with no limitations on activities, including exercise; and normalization of pulmonary function. The risk domain includes criteria that deal with future events that the treatment program should either prevent or reduce to the greatest extent possible: reduction (or elimination of) in the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations; minimal or no loss of lung function over time (considered to be a potential consequence of airway remodeling); and minimal or no adverse effects from medications.\r\n The initial selection of pharmacologic treatment is determined based on the age of the patient and the severity of his or her asthma at the time of evaluation. Because asthma is a variable but chronic disease (or syndrome), specific treatment will need to be adjusted both acutely, or during exacerbations, and chronically in the context of eliminating or reducing both impairment and risk because they dynamically fluctuate over time to achieve acceptable control. a stepwise approach has been adapted for treatment to accomplish these goals (http:\/\/www.nhlbi.nih.gov\/guidelines\/ asthma\/asthgdln.htm). 4 The basis of the stepwise approach is to increase the number, frequency, and dose of medications with increasing asthma severity until the patient's disease has been put under ''control'' (ie, achieving optimal control for that patient). Once control has been established, step-down therapy can be attempted to minimize medication burden, when possible. Recently, the concept of response to therapy has also received increasing attention. Responsiveness is the ease with which asthma control is achieved by therapy. Responsiveness to an asthma treatment is highly variable, and it is likely that both genetic and phenotypic characteristics contribute to this intrapatient and interpatient variability in response over time. 96, 97 In the last few years, a number of published clinical trials with new therapeutic agents or novel treatment strategies are noteworthy based on their potential effect in initiating or adjusting medication based on this stepwise severity scheme. The first set of trials pertains to the treatment of preschool wheezing children. One trial 98 evaluated continuous ICS treatment (2 years receiving therapy with an ICS and the third year receiving as-needed medication, which served as the observation year) in children who had a positive asthma predictive index (API). Children with positive APIs in the first 3 years of life have about a 65% chance of having clinically diagnosed asthma by age 6 years. During the 2 years of treatment with a low-dose ICS (fluticasone, 88 mg twice daily) compared with matching placebo, treated children had significantly greater numbers of episode-free days and reduced exacerbations requiring oral steroid treatment. However, after discontinuation of the ICS treatment at the beginning of the observation period, episode-free days were no different than in the placebo group within about 3 months. Reduced airway resistance in the ICS group at the end of the treatment period was no longer evident at the end of the observation period. Thus early recognition and treatment of high-risk children can reduce symptom burden while receiving therapy but does not appear to alter the natural history of asthma. 98 Similar negative results were seen when intermittent ICS therapy was prescribed. 99 Intermittent therapy with either an ICS or montelukast at the onset of respiratory tract symptoms was able to reduce symptom burden during these illnesses; however, these beneficial effects were only seen in children with positive APIs. 100 In a third study in preschool-aged children with moderate-to-severe, presumed virus-induced wheezing, pre-emptive treatment with high-dose fluticasone (750 mg twice daily at the start of upper respiratory tract symptoms) compared with placebo reduced the use of rescue oral corticosteroids. However, treatment with fluticasone was associated with a smaller gain in height and weight. 101 Finally, in preschool children presenting to a hospital with mild-to-moderate wheezing associated with a presumed viral infection, oral prednisolone was not superior to placebo in reducing the duration of the hospital stay. 102 These disparate results in this age group might relate to host (eg, presence or absence of atopy 103 ), viral (cause\/pathogenicity of viral infection, such as rhinovirus vs RSV 104 ), or both factors that confer differential responses to these types of interventions. More studies are obviously needed before precise recommendations can be made in this age group.\r\n The second set of trials pertains to the use of long-acting b-agonists (LABAs) in combination with ICSs for the treatment of persistent asthma. Although a number of clinical trials have demonstrated both safety and efficacy in terms of asthma control in both the impairment and risk domains, 105 concern has been raised about the potential for adverse outcomes in a small number of patients with the use of LABAs. 106 Recent continued review of the available data has re-emphasized these potential safety issues in both children and adults. 107 Unfortunately, the possible mechanisms underlying these rare events are unknown. Moreover, the numbers of patients needed to be prospectively evaluated to ascertain the precise risks involved might be too large to realistically enroll. 108 Overall, however, the benefits of combination therapy appear to outweigh the risks in the majority of patients. Monotherapy with LABAs in asthmatic subjects should not be prescribed.\r\n Asthma is a complex genetic disorder that is characterized by airway inflammation and reversible airflow obstruction. It is further distinguished by multiple phenotypes that might differ based on age of onset, triggering factors, and patterns of severity both during acute exacerbations and on a more chronic basis, as reflected by variably reversible loss of lung function. As a result of this clinical heterogeneity, treatment approaches need to be individualized and modified to obtain and maintain adequate symptom and disease control over time. Although current therapy is targeted at the development of secondary and tertiary prevention strategies, ongoing research is evaluating the prospects of primary prevention as well.","sha":"b4a97a04b13b7436c036959ddb6019a435dcec66","publish_time":"2010-02-28","authors":"Lemanske, Robert F.; Busse, William W.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","doi":"10.1016\/j.jaci.2009.10.047","Title":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","H index":262.0,"transmission_indicator":true,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder that is characterized by variable airflow obstruction, airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, and reversibility either spontaneously or as a result of treatment. For many asthmatic subjects, the disease has its roots during infancy and early childhood. Viral respiratory tract infections produce wheezing episodes during the first 3 years of life in about 50% of children. 14 About one fourth of children with asthma might experience greater rates of loss of lung function, and these children have certain phenotypic characteristics: younger age, male sex, higher postbronchodilator FEV 1 percent predicted, and greater airway eosinophilic inflammation. 15 Molecular and cellular mechanisms in asthma Children. In addition, levels of leukotriene B 4 and C 4 , prostaglandin E 2 , and the potentially epitheliumderived 15-hydroxyeicosattetranoic acid were all increased. 27 Levels of the inflammatory mediators cysteinyl leukotrienes are increased in the EBC of children with atopic asthma, even while receiving corticosteroid treatment. Asthma for most, but not all, patients begins in early life. An understanding of the immunopathology of airways in asthma has been markedly advanced with the use of bronchoscopy and biopsy. 32 Eosinophils are a characteristic feature of allergic inflammation. Eosinophils are recruited to the airway in asthmatic subjects by families of cytokines, and chemokines (eg, IL-5, RANTES, and eotaxin) undergo cell activation through processes not fully identified and release highly inflammatory granule-associated substances, the actions of which injure the airway and cause persistent inflammation. Epithelial cells are also a rich source of inflammatory mediators and growth factors. 38 There are other airway cells involved in asthma histopathology, including mucous glands and blood vessels. In subjects with asthma, mucous glands hypertrophy occurs. Understanding that heterogeneity exists in the pattern of airway inflammation and the likely molecular factors regulating these processes explains why current therapy is not effective in all subjects with asthma. 57 Although the importance of gene-environment interactions in the expression of disease has recently been highlighted, 58 the complexities involved in analyzing these relationships from a functional perspective have proved challenging. 59 Recent pharmacogenetic evaluations in relationship to chronic b-agonist use 60 and corticosteroid efficacy have provided new insights into the variability of response in asthmatic patients. Once established in genetically predisposed individuals, IgE-mediated reactions are a major contributor both to acute asthmatic symptoms and chronic airway inflammation. 61 Although a wide variety of inhaled allergens can provoke asthma symptoms, sensitization to house dust mite, 62 cockroach, 63 Alternaria species, 64 and possibly cat 40 are important in the pathogenesis of asthma. Respiratory tract infections caused by viruses, 1,68,69 Chlamydia species, 70 and Mycoplasma species 70 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. The viruses most convincingly demonstrated in this regard have been rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The increased tendency for viral infections to produce lower airway symptoms in asthmatic subjects might be related, at least in part, to interactions among allergic sensitization, allergen exposure, and viral infections acting as cofactors in the induction of acute episodes of airflow obstruction. 72, 73 Abnormalities in the innate immune response that would prevent viral replication in airway epithelial cells from asthmatic subjects have recently been demonstrated. Exercise is one of the more common precipitants of airway obstruction in asthmatic subjects. The symptoms are most intense for 5 to 10 minutes and usually resolve within 15 to 30 minutes after exercise cessation. 83 In addition, there is evidence that mast cell activation occurs, and its mediators can be detected in nasal secretions during an episode of aspirin-induced asthma. In patients with aspirininduced asthma, desensitization with aspirin has proved beneficial in improved asthma control, as well as improved sense of smell, reduced purulent sinus infections, and need for further polyp surgery. A number of clinical trials have begun to evaluate the effect of suppressing acid reflux on asthma symptoms. Proton-pump inhibitors had no significant effect on a variety of asthma outcomes. 90 The mechanisms by which this occurs have not been defined but might include the promotion of allergic inflammation. For example, Liu et al 91 found stress from final examinations to enhance eosinophil recruitment to the airway after an antigen inhalation challenge. Chen et al 92 evaluated the influence of socioeconomic status, which they related to stress, on cytokine generation. With peripheral blood cells from asthmatic subjects but not healthy control subjects, lower socioeconomic status was associated with greater generation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-5 and IL-13.

For dust mite and cockroach allergens, there is a dose response relationship between domestic exposure and sensitization. Given that allergen provocation can induce many of the features of asthma, the findings strongly suggest that there is a causal relationship between allergen exposure in the home and asthma. However, it remains unclear at what time the critical exposure occurs (ie, in infancy or later) and what role allergen exposure has played in the increasing prevalence and severity of asthma. Objective evidence of an immune response to allergens is generally not present until after 2 years of age. Viral infections play several different roles in asthma in childhood. In infancy, respiratory syncytial virus infection can induce bronchiolitis and set up recurrent wheezing over the next few years. However, the risk factors for this are maternal smoking and small lungs at birth, rather than allergy. By contrast, the role of rhinovirus in precipitating attacks in children and young adults is strongly associated with allergy. Thus the likely scenario is that allergen exposure over the first few years of life induces sensitization (ie, T H2 cells and IgE antibodies). Continuing exposure can maintain inflammation in the nose and lungs. However, many other factors contribute to wheezing such that there is no simple relationship between allergen exposure and asthma. Nonetheless, it is clear that the changes that have increased asthma have acted on allergic children. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2000;105:S503-8.)","text_body":"Because all plants and animals produce enzymes and other proteins, it is inevitable that humans are exposed to a wide range of foreign proteins that are potentially immunogenic. For many of these noninfectious sources, exposure consists of inhaling small quantities repeatedly over a period of months or years; in keeping with results in mice, the most common immune response to this form of exposure is immediate hypersensitivity (ie, IgE antibodies and T cells of the T H2 type. Given the consistent evidence that inhaled allergens play an important role in chronic asthma among school-aged children, it becomes very important to understand when immune responses to inhalants occur and how they interact with other factors that are involved in the development of asthma. Infants and children are also exposed to foreign proteins in their food, and immune responses to these may influence both the development of lung disease and subsequent responses to inhalant allergens.\r\n Traditionally, the best recognized and best understood inhaled allergens were those derived from pollens. However, it has long been recognized that house dust extracts could produce positive skin tests. Over the last 15 years, the contents of house dust have become well defined. More important, it has become clear that it is sensitization to indoor allergens that is most strongly associated with asthma. 1 In many humid countries, allergens derived from dust mites are by far the most important cause of sensitization, and much of the epidemiologic and immunologic data relate to mites (Table I) . [1] [2] [3] Evaluation of the immunologic data has been made possible by the availability of purified allergens from dust mites that allow measurement of specific antibodies and evaluation of T-cell responses in vitro. 4, 5 It is also possible to measure dust mite allergens in the environment with the use of monoclonal antibody-based immunoassays. 6 Thus we can consider 3 separate but related areas: (1) the nature of the immune response, (2) the relationship between exposure and immune responses to mite allergens, and (3) the relevance of this immune response to the development of asthma.\r\n In almost all epidemiologic studies, sensitization to allergens has been determined by skin tests or serum assays for IgE antibodies. However, the immune response also includes IgG, IgG4, and IgA antibodies. These antibodies are most reliably detected with radiolabeled purified allergens. Following children from birth, antibodies only become detectable around 2 years of age. 2, 7 In general, IgG antibodies are detected first, but IgE can be detected in the serum of many atopic children by the age of 4 years. 2, 8 With ELISA assays, rather different results have been obtained. In some of these studies, IgG antibodies can be detected in a large proportion of sera and can be detected very early in life. It has even been suggested that IgG antibodies detected in chord sera The relevance of allergen exposure to the development of asthma in childhood reflect an immune response in utero. 9 Solid-phase assays such as ELISA have 2 problems. First, the nonspecific background is related to the total serum level of the isotype being measured. This makes sensitive measurement of IgG or IgG1 antibodies difficult or impossible. By contrast, measurements of IgG4 or IgE antibodies are more reliable. Second, because the antigen is fixed, solid phase assays will detect antibodies of lower affinity than those detected with fluid phase assays. In addition, the solid phase has a wide range of proteins so that the IgG antibodies that are binding to proteins other than those recognized by IgE antibodies may be detected. Thus results for IgG antibodies with ELISA need to be interpreted with caution.\r\n Evidence for T-cell responses to allergens was obtained as early as 1973. Most, but not all, studies reported that individuals with allergy had specific T cells although individuals with no allergy made little or no response. These studies have always been most convincing when purified allergens have been used. 10, 11 Once it became possible to measure cytokines, it was clear that T cells from individuals with allergy produced cytokines in vitro. Subsequently, it became clear that T cells from individuals with allergy make cytokines typical of T H2 responses (ie, IL-4 and IL-5). 12 By contrast, when allergen-specific T-cell clones can be derived from individuals with no allergy, they generally produce IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3. 12, 13 It is now undoubted that circulating T cells of the T H2 type are characteristic of the response to dust mite allergens among individuals with allergy. However, there are confusing reports about the timing of the response. In some studies, T-cell proliferation in response to mite extracts has been detected in chord blood, suggesting that the first recognition of allergens occurs in utero. 9, 14 However, these responses are not detectable at 6 months of age, and it remains to be estab-lished that the cells that proliferate are part of an immune response. Some of these studies have used a serum-free medium (Aim V), which may allow nonspecific effects of the antigen preparation used. Studies with the Aim V medium that used other antigens showed very marked inhibition of both proliferation and cytokine production. 15 A further problem with interpreting the data on responses in infants comes from the report that similar responses are found with the chord blood of infants whose mothers were not exposed to significant mite allergen during pregnancy. 16 It is unlikely that sufficient mite allergen can be absorbed and cross the placenta when the quantity inhaled per day is only 10 to 100 ng, and it is not conceivable that the fetus makes an immune response when the mother is exposed to a quantity of antigen that is not associated with immune responses in children.\r\n Intuitively, it is obvious that individuals will only experience an immune response if they are exposed to sufficient antigen. However, accurate definition of these parameters depends on being able to measure exposure. The measurement of allergens in house dust became possible when the allergens were purified and has become easier and more consistent with monoclonal antibodies. [4] [5] [6] We can now measure representative allergens derived from dust mites, cockroach, cat, and dog. [4] [5] [6] 17 In addition, the relationship between airborne levels of each allergen and floor or reservoir concentrations has been defined. 1, 18, 19 However, this does not amount to an accurate measurement of the quantities inhaled by an infant or child over a prolonged period of time. This caveat also applies to avoidance measures, because their success is The main conclusions for dust mite are clear. In communities where the mean group I mite allergen concentration in bedding is more than 2 \u00b5g\/g of dust, dust mite sensitization will be common among atopic individuals and will be significantly associated with asthma (Table  II) . In Germany, Kuehr et al 24 confirmed that the threshold for atopic children was approximately 2 \u00b5g. By contrast, for \"nonatopic\" children (ie, those children who had no positive skin tests), sensitization was unlikely to occur at concentrations less than 40 \u00b5g\/group I allergen\/g. The threshold values for exposure can be seen simply in relation to sensitization or in relation to the risk of asthma among atopic individuals. Understanding the timing of the immune response is important because it defines the time at which avoidance measures, or other interventions, would have to be performed to influence these responses. The only convincing data relates to avoidance measures in the first year of life. 8 Those studies strongly suggest that exposure in the first year of life can influence responses. Our own data from the prospective study found that measurements of mite allergen in children's bedrooms during the first 2 years of life predicted subsequent sensitization. In addition, measurement of exposure at age 1 to 2 years was a better predictor of asthma at age 11 years than measurements of exposure at age 11 years. 2 In that study, very high levels of exposure in the first year were also associated with earlier onset of disease. Peat et al 20, 25 in Sydney have found similar data supporting the importance of early exposure to high levels of mite allergen. Overall, there is good evidence that early exposure to dust mite allergens is a significant factor in sensitization and the development of asthma. However, whether this needs to occur within some defined period of time or is cumula-tive over the period up to the time when immune responses are detectable is not clear. Although it seems clear that early exposure to high concentrations of allergen is important, it is still difficult to define the age at which the critical events in this response occur. In prospective studies, some children do not experience skin tests, antibodies, or symptoms until after the age of 5 years. 2 For allergens other than dust mite, the dose response relationship to sensitization is less well defined. This is in part because the studies have not been done, but also because exposure is influenced by decisions of the inhabitants and because there are very different patterns of distribution. The quantities of animal dander or cockroach antigens are in large part influenced by whether the occupants choose to allow these animals to share the house. For cat and dog allergens, it is clear that allergen remains airborne so that there is a different relationship between reservoir measurements and inhaled allergen. 18 The particles carrying cat and dog allergen are \"sticky\" and are transferred extensively from houses with a cat to other houses or to school. 26, 27 It is possible to identify communities where very few of the families have pets and where sensitization to these allergens is not significantly associated with asthma. Thus in several recent studies on African American children living in poverty, sensitization to cat allergens was not found to be a risk factor for asthma. The mean concentration of allergen found in dust from those houses (ie, <1 \u00b5g Fel d 1\/g dust) could be said to define a threshold below which sensitization to cat allergen is unlikely. [28] [29] [30] [31] Allergens derived from the German cockroach are an important source of sensitization in areas where infestation is common. 28 However, it is not clear at what age sensitization occurs, nor where the main exposure occurs. In most infested houses, the highest concentrations are found in kitchens, and this may be the best site to sample to define whether a house is infested. 30 On the other hand, the recent National Cooperative Inner City Asthma Study found that cockroach allergen in children's bedrooms was an important predictor of hospitalization. 31 The results allow the conclusion that in communities where less than 5% of the houses have more than 10 units Bla g 2\/g dust, sensitization to cockroach allergens will be rare and will not be associated with asthma. \r\n Among school-aged children, sensitization to 1 or more of the major indoor allergens is the dominant risk factor for asthma defined as symptomatic bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR). 3, 23, 32 In keeping with the view that these proteins cause asthma, inhalation of allergens in a bronchial challenge can produce both immediate and late falls in FEV 1 values. Furthermore, the late responses are accompanied by eosinophil infiltration and increase in BHR. 33 Children and young adults who are taken out of their houses and moved to \"allergen free\" sanatoria or hospital rooms, experience improvement in symptoms, reduced medication requirements, and decreased BHR. 1 Thus it is highly likely that current inhalation of allergens in houses plays a role in the symptoms that are so commonly experienced by individuals with allergy. Analysis of the quantities of allergen inhaled and the size of mite particles suggests that natural exposure is not sufficient to induce acute bronchospasm and may play a much more important role in maintaining chronic BHR. There are many other factors that can contribute to symptoms and BHR, and the problem is to understand how they interact with the response to allergens either in the development of asthma or in producing exacerbations.\r\n Viral infection in early childhood has been proposed to have 2 quite opposite effects. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an extremely important cause of bronchiolitis in the first 2 years of life. 34, 35 All children are infected with RSV within the first 2 years, and they make an immune response whether they have lung symptoms or not. Thus bronchiolitis with hospitalization is the severe end of the response to this virus and appears to be related to the size of the lungs at birth. Welliver et al 34 suggested that RSV infection in early childhood predisposes to subsequent development of asthma. The assumption is either that the infection changes the lungs in some way or that RSV infection can influence subsequent immune responses to other antigens. The young children who are admitted to hospital with RSV infection do not have measurable antibodies to inhalant allergens or peripheral blood eosinophilia at the time when they are hospitalized. 35, 36 On the other hand, some of them have high concentrations of eosinophil cationic protein in their nasal secretions. 37 In mouse models of RSV infection, the immune response to different viral proteins determines whether the animals make an eosinophilic response to subsequent infection with the whole virus. 38 The problem is that prospective studies have given very different figures for the percentage of the children with bronchiolitis who subsequently experience the development of asthma. In addition, most groups have not been able to measure significant IgE ab to RSV antigens in these children. At present, it seems that symptomatic RSV infection is not a precursor of allergic asthma in more than a small proportion of cases. However, the immune response to RSV may be important either as an influence on the immune system or as an indi-cation of the immune response that the child will make to other antigens.\r\n In an entirely different model, it has been suggested that viral and other infections in early childhood might be protective against the subsequent development of asthma. 39 This hypothesis was developed to explain the striking decrease in asthma among later members of large families compared with first or only children. 40 However, in many communities large families are rare, and a protective effect of early infection does little to explain the high prevalence of asthma in US cities. Although it is undoubtedly attractive to suggest that early infection could stimulate T H1 responses and thus influence subsequent responses to inhalant allergens, neither the epidemiologic evidence nor detailed mechanism for this hypothesis is available. One of the major changes in life style over the last 35 years has been the widespread use of antibiotics. However, the argument would have to be that antibiotics prevent a T H1 response to bacteria, and this predisposes to T H2 responses. Again, direct evidence for such a mechanism is lacking. This type of model would propose that the primary cause of the increased prevalence of asthma was progressive increase in allergic responses. There are many reasons for thinking that this is not what has happened.\r\n The clearest role of viral infections in asthma is as a cause of exacerbations among patients with chronic asthma. The evidence for this comes from observations on a cohort of children, from case control studies on children seen in an emergency room, and from experimental studies on viral infection of patients with allergy. 35, 36, 41, 42 From most of these studies, it appears that infection with rhinovirus or corona virus in conjunction with allergen exposure or in a patient with inflammation induced by allergen exposure can precipitate an acute exacerbation. These exacerbations are accompanied by a marked increase in nasal eosinophils and cytokines, which may well parallel events occurring in the lungs. Recent evidence following up acute episodes has shown that both rhinovirus expression as judged by PCR and nasal eosinophil cationic protein become negative over the weeks after an acute episode. 43 When studies on rhinovirus were performed on children under 2 years of age, there was no correlation between PCR evidence of rhinovirus infection and acute episodes of asthma. 36 Thus it is unlikely that rhinovirus plays a role in the early development of asthma. On the other hand, rhinovirus plays an important role in the development of symptomatic asthma among individuals with allergy after the age of 2 years.\r\n There is clearly a major genetic component to the development of allergic disease, and this appears to apply to both IgE antibody responses and the development of asthma. 44 By the age of 13 years, there is also a strong association between asthma and IgE antibodies to one or more indoor allergens. If we take a simple analysis, asth-ma could have become more common because of an increase in indoor allergens leading to increased sensitization or to a change in immune responsiveness such that the same or similar exposure induces more individuals to become sensitized or that some other effect has altered the threshold for wheezing among individuals with allergy. There are many ways in which changes in domestic houses (eg, increases in temperature and furnishings and decreased ventilation) could have increased exposure to indoor allergens. However, this effect does not appear to be sufficient to explain the increase in asthma. In addition, there are several situations where the real change appears to be an increase in bronchial reactivity or wheezing among individuals with allergy. 45, 46 Thus it becomes important to understand not only the factors influencing the immune response but also those circumstances that can trigger the development of inflammation and wheezing in an allergic individual. Several studies have focused on the importance of early exposure to allergens (ie, the first 2 years of life). In most of those studies, the monitoring of exposure is restricted to 1 or 2 samples of reservoir dust. Thus at present, it is not possible to distinguish between the effect of exposure in the first 6 months or year and those of cumulative exposure over the first 3 years of life. Convincing evidence about immune responses (ie, skin tests or IgE or IgG antibodies) generally does not appear until after 3 years of age. Although there are some data suggesting that prenatal or very early postnatal exposure may influence subsequent events, none of these results are sufficiently persuasive. In particular, the data on proliferative responses from chord blood lymphocytes or increased allergic responses among children born in certain seasons of the year do not add up to a convincing argument for sensitization in utero or early life. Seasonality is also seen with food allergens, and the proliferation to mite has been seen with chord blood from children living in areas with low levels of mite exposure. It is also clear that continued exposure to mite allergens can influence sensitization among schoolaged children and even among adults. 24 Understanding the relationship between these immune responses and the development of asthma remains difficult. Unfortunately, the prospective data does not show a simple temporal relationship. Indeed, some children who are highly allergic to mite allergens at age 11 years were first reported to wheeze before they experienced the development of skin tests or serum antibodies. 2, 7 Episodes of viral-induced wheezing could occur before the development of allergic responses, and the immune response would be seen as the reason for persistence. Some children experience the development of positive skin tests before they start wheezing. This raises the question, which may be really important, as to what makes the difference between children with allergy and children with allergy with wheezing. Recent studies suggest that a large part of the increase in asthma can be ascribed to a progressive increase in wheezing among children with allergy. Many different factors have been identified that can increase inflammatory responses to allergen. These include diesel particulates, ozone, rhinovirus, and \u03b2-2-agonists. However, it is clear that the increase is strongly related to western society. 1, 47 Indeed, it appears that asthma remains rare among children in those countries where walking is the normal means of transport and parasitic infections remain common. [45] [46] [47] In conclusion, there are several elements about asthma that are very well defined, but the events in the first 2 years of life are not. The relative importance of RSV infection, bacterial infections with or without antibiotics, allergen exposure, and nutrition remain unclear. In the development of the progression of asthma after age 2 years, allergen exposure, sensitization to indoor allergens, and intercurrent viral infections are all important. But, again, the details are not clear, and the role of these in the progressive increase in asthma in western society is less clear. It remains a major objective of research to understand the reasons for the increase in asthma among children with allergy because it is unlikely that we will achieve healthy children unless the real cause of the increase is made a target for treatment. 48, 49 ","sha":"18d8539db21ca5295042773ffd6621ea61a04fbe","publish_time":"2000-02-29","authors":"Platts-Mills, Thomas A.E.; Rakes, Gary; Heymann, Peter W.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","doi":"10.1016\/s0091-6749(00)90051-4","Title":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","H index":262.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Because all plants and animals produce enzymes and other proteins, it is inevitable that humans are exposed to a wide range of foreign proteins that are potentially immunogenic. For many of these noninfectious sources, exposure consists of inhaling small quantities repeatedly over a period of months or years; in keeping with results in mice, the most common immune response to this form of exposure is immediate hypersensitivity (ie, IgE antibodies and T cells of the T H2 type. Given the consistent evidence that inhaled allergens play an important role in chronic asthma among school-aged children, it becomes very important to understand when immune responses to inhalants occur and how they interact with other factors that are involved in the development of asthma. 1] [2] [3] Evaluation of the immunologic data has been made possible by the availability of purified allergens from dust mites that allow measurement of specific antibodies and evaluation of T-cell responses in vitro. However, the immune response also includes IgG, IgG4, and IgA antibodies. These antibodies are most reliably detected with radiolabeled purified allergens. 2, 7 In general, IgG antibodies are detected first, but IgE can be detected in the serum of many atopic children by the age of 4 years. 9 Solid-phase assays such as ELISA have 2 problems. This makes sensitive measurement of IgG or IgG1 antibodies difficult or impossible. Second, because the antigen is fixed, solid phase assays will detect antibodies of lower affinity than those detected with fluid phase assays. Evidence for T-cell responses to allergens was obtained as early as 1973. However, there are confusing reports about the timing of the response. Some of these studies have used a serum-free medium (Aim V), which may allow nonspecific effects of the antigen preparation used. 15 A further problem with interpreting the data on responses in infants comes from the report that similar responses are found with the chord blood of infants whose mothers were not exposed to significant mite allergen during pregnancy. However, accurate definition of these parameters depends on being able to measure exposure. In communities where the mean group I mite allergen concentration in bedding is more than 2 \u00b5g\/g of dust, dust mite sensitization will be common among atopic individuals and will be significantly associated with asthma (Table  II) . In Germany, Kuehr et al 24 confirmed that the threshold for atopic children was approximately 2 \u00b5g. Our own data from the prospective study found that measurements of mite allergen in children's bedrooms during the first 2 years of life predicted subsequent sensitization. Peat et al 20, 25 in Sydney have found similar data supporting the importance of early exposure to high levels of mite allergen. The mean concentration of allergen found in dust from those houses (ie, <1 \u00b5g Fel d 1\/g dust) could be said to define a threshold below which sensitization to cat allergen is unlikely. [ 3, 23, 32 In keeping with the view that these proteins cause asthma, inhalation of allergens in a bronchial challenge can produce both immediate and late falls in FEV 1 values. Furthermore, the late responses are accompanied by eosinophil infiltration and increase in BHR. 37 In mouse models of RSV infection, the immune response to different viral proteins determines whether the animals make an eosinophilic response to subsequent infection with the whole virus. In an entirely different model, it has been suggested that viral and other infections in early childhood might be protective against the subsequent development of asthma. 40 However, in many communities large families are rare, and a protective effect of early infection does little to explain the high prevalence of asthma in US cities. One of the major changes in life style over the last 35 years has been the widespread use of antibiotics. Again, direct evidence for such a mechanism is lacking. There are many reasons for thinking that this is not what has happened. The evidence for this comes from observations on a cohort of children, from case control studies on children seen in an emergency room, and from experimental studies on viral infection of patients with allergy. There are many ways in which changes in domestic houses (eg, increases in temperature and furnishings and decreased ventilation) could have increased exposure to indoor allergens. However, this effect does not appear to be sufficient to explain the increase in asthma. Indeed, some children who are highly allergic to mite allergens at age 11 years were first reported to wheeze before they experienced the development of skin tests or serum antibodies. Recent studies suggest that a large part of the increase in asthma can be ascribed to a progressive increase in wheezing among children with allergy. Many different factors have been identified that can increase inflammatory responses to allergen. These include diesel particulates, ozone, rhinovirus, and \u03b2-2-agonists. However, it is clear that the increase is strongly related to western society. In the development of the progression of asthma after age 2 years, allergen exposure, sensitization to indoor allergens, and intercurrent viral infections are all important."},{"Unnamed: 0":49,"Unnamed: 0.1":49,"doc_id":"5c516b703f224966953f750f675711d27a6190ac","title":"Predicting ALI Resolution: A Role For Chest CT? HHS Public Access","abstract":"Advances in critical care have led to a significant reduction in mortality from ALI over the last 50 years. As mortality has decreased, interest in quantifying post-hospital outcomes of ALI survivors has increased. Many ALI survivors have significant impairments in physical and cognitive function that may persist for years following hospitalization, despite nearcomplete recovery of pulmonary function in the majority of patients (1-4). However, a subset of ALI survivors have prolonged pulmonary dysfunction (5) that may contribute to their reduced quality of life. The etiology of the reduced lung function in ALI survivors has been a matter of recent debate, as reductions in forced vital capacity (FVC) theoretically could be due to intrinsic lung disease or prolonged neuromuscular weakness, a significant and recently recognized problem in ALI patients and survivors.","text_body":"The study by Burnham and colleagues (6) in this issue of Critical Care Medicine adds significantly to this body of literature by evaluating the relationship between pulmonary function, intrinsic lung disease and neuromuscular weakness in a cohort of ALI survivors. Burnham prospectively followed patients from a recently published trial on the use of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) in ALI (7) . As a component of the trial design, patients received a chest computed tomography (CT) scan at day 14 after enrollment (which could have been up to 7 days following ALI diagnosis) and at day 180 (6 months) after enrollment. Since the duration of mechanical ventilation in the parent study was approximately 14 days (7), it can be assumed that most patients were in the resolution phase of lung injury at the first timepoint. At the 6 month timepoint, patients additionally underwent pulmonary function testing, muscle functional testing, and completed two health related quality of life (HRQoL) surveys, the Short Form-36 (SF-36) and the St George's Respiratory Questionairre (SGRQ).\r\n Over time, the majority of the objective measures captured in the survivors improved. CT scan findings improved, median pulmonary function test values normalized, and median medical research council (MRC) scores evaluating for neuromuscular weakness were normal. However, in subjective measures of wellness, measured by the SF-36 and SGRQ, median scores were abnormal. The authors point out that despite normalization of the median values of the objective data, 25% of survivors had abnormal PFT's and 11% had MRC scores consistent with severe neuromuscular weakness.\r\n An important finding from the study was that CT scans obtained at day 14 predicted both impaired PFT's and reduced HRQoL scores at the 6 month timepoint. In particular, worsening CT scan scores at day 14 were highly correlated with restrictive physiology (both reduced total lung capacity and DLCO) at 6 months. In multivariate analysis, worsening CT scores at day 14 were independently associated with reductions in HRQoL scores on both SF-36 and SGRQ at 6 months, adjusting for age, ventilator days, severity of illness and other factors. MRC scores were not captured at 14 days, so the presence of neuromuscular weakness at day 14 in predicting 6 month HRQoL scores could not be assessed in this cohort. Given that most patients in the study had clinically improved by day 14, one can speculate that the patients with poor lung imaging scores at day 14 were the patients who had not clinically improved.\r\n Previous studies have shown that a variety of clinical, radiologic and biochemical parameters can assist in predicting 28-day mortality from ALI (8-12) while more recent studies have shown that some of these parameters also predict poor long-term outcomes in survivors (13, 14) . The current study adds to this literature, illustrating that worsening lung injury scores on CT scans can predict poor long-term functional outcomes in ALI survivors. The patients who survive but do not completely resolve, either in terms of lung function, muscle function, or neurocognitive impairment, represents an exciting new area of critical care research.\r\n Limitations to this study include the small number of patients apparently driving the correlation of CT scans to HRQoL scores and PFTs at the 6 month timepoint. Additionally, the lack of muscle functional data at day 14 limits complete evaluation of muscle weakness as a predictor of long term outcomes in this cohort. While manual muscle testing with the MRC scale is currently the standard clinical test for ICU acquired neuromuscular weakness, this exam is insensitive for detecting subtle weakness (15) or muscle fatigue that could have potentially contributed to the reduced HRQoL scores. More practical hurdles remain before incorporating a tool such as lung CT into clinical practice, such as the risk of transportation of patients, additional exposure to ionizing radiation, and the need for consistent radiologic interpretation and scoring of scans. Despite these potential barriers, a scoring system such as the one used here may be useful for future ALI clinical studies as a readout of lung resolution and response to potential therapies.\r\n In summary, the work of Burnham and colleagues suggests that impaired radiologic resolution of lung injury predicts reduced functional status among ALI survivors. Further studies are needed to develop this tool as a predictor for reduced functional outcomes in ALI patients and to determine its value beyond simple clinical measurements that may impose less risk. If validated, lung imaging prior to hospital discharge has the potential to become an important tool in both clinical research trials aimed at prognosticating outcomes in ALI, and subsequently in clinical practice.","sha":"5c516b703f224966953f750f675711d27a6190ac","publish_time":"2013-02-01","authors":"Files, D.

Our study provides proof-of-concept for a novel low-cost oral ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) delivery system using transplastomic technology for pulmonary disease therapeutics.\r\n Keywords chloroplast; molecular farming; plant-made pharmaceuticals; pulmonary hypertension; reninangiotensin system Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a devastating lung disease characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation, which eventually leads to right heart failure and death. 1 Although significant advances have been made in recent years to improve the quality of life of patients with PH, none of the current treatments are successful in reversing PH or decreasing mortality. This has led to the realization that novel mechanism-based therapies must be developed to accomplish this goal. 2 It is well-recognized that activation of the vasodeleterious axis of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), comprising of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II, and angiotensin type I receptor (AT1R), is involved in the development of PH. 3, 4 However, the clinical use of ACE inhibitors or AT1R blockers have yielded mixed results, thereby failing to reach a consensus opinion about their use for PH therapy. Nonetheless, the recent discovery of a close homolog of ACE, ACE2 has resulted in the reevaluation of the role of RAS in PH. 5, 6 ACE2 is widely expressed in the lungs, 7 predominantly on the pulmonary vascular endothelium, and catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin II to Angiotensin- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) [Ang- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) ]. Ang-(1-7) is a vasoactive heptapeptide that mediates its effects by stimulating the Mas receptor. 8 Thus, ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas receptor constitutes the vasoprotective axis of the RAS, which counterbalances the deleterious actions of the ACE-angiotensin II-AT1R axis.\r\n Recent reports indicate that decreased tissue and circulating levels of ACE2 are associated with lung diseases in humans. 9, 10 However, restoration of ACE2 through genetic overexpression, administration of recombinant protein, or use of pharmacological ACE2 activators resulted in cardiopulmonary protective effects against animal models of pulmonary diseases. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] These findings provided compelling evidence for initiating clinical trials with recombinant ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) in treating pulmonary disorders. Although clinical trials are currently underway, the cost of manufacturing, protein stability, repetitive intravenous dosing, and patient compliance pose major impediments in realizing full therapeutic potential of this therapy. We think that development of a plant-based oral delivery system will be an ideal approach to overcome these aforementioned challenges and achieve clinical success. Therefore, our objective in this study was to develop a low-cost oral delivery system for administering ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) and test its efficacy in an experimental model of PH. We took advantage of transplastomic technology that enables chloroplasts to generate high levels of therapeutic proteins within plant leaves. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] This technology presents minimal risk of human pathogen or endotoxin contamination, eliminates complex protein purification steps, and abolishes cold chain and sterile delivery requirements that are commonly associated with protein therapy. [22] [23] [24] Efficacy of plant-based pharmaceuticals has been validated by the fact that Food and Drug Administration has recently approved the use of taliglucerase alfa (Trade name: Elelyso) in the treatment of Gaucher disease. 25 This study provides evidence for the development of an oral delivery system to administer ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) using transplastomic technology and demonstrates its efficacy in an established rat model of monocrotaline-induced PH.\r\n The online-only Data Supplement includes detailed descriptions of all the methods and additional supporting data.\r\n The native human ACE2 cDNA and synthetic Ang-(1-7) DNA sequences were cloned into the chloroplast transformation vector (pLDutr; Figure 1A ). For efficient delivery of the proteins into circulation, a carrier protein, cholera nontoxic B subunit (CTB), was fused to the N terminal of both therapeutic proteins ( Figure 1A ), which facilitates their transmucosal delivery by binding to monosialotetrahexosylganglioside receptors (GM1) present on the intestinal epithelial cells. Hinge (Gly-Pro-Gly-Pro) and furin cleavage site (Arg-Arg-Lys-Arg) were placed between CTB and therapeutic proteins ( Figure 1A ) to eliminate steric hindrance and aid systemic release of these therapeutic proteins after they are internalized via ligand-receptor complex formation on the surface of epithelial cells. The expression of the fusion genes was driven by light regulated strong chloroplast psbA promoter, and the transcripts were stabilized by placing the psbA untranslated region at the 3\u2032 end of the fusion genes ( Figure 1A ). To select the chloroplast transformed with the fusion genes, aminoglycoside-3\u2033-adenylyl-transferase gene (aadA), driven by the chloroplast ribosomal RNA promoter (Prrn), was incorporated into the expression cassette to confer the transformants resistance to spectinomycin ( Figure 1A ). This expression cassette was flanked by DNA sequences of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (trnI) and alanyl-tRNA synthetase (trnA) genes, identical to the native chloroplast genome at both flanks ( Figure 1A ). The flanking sequences serve to facilitate transgene integration into the chloroplast genome ( Figure 1A ) via double homologous recombination. Chloroplast transformation vectors expressing the ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) genes were coated onto gold particles and delivered into chloroplasts using the biolistic particle delivery system. 26 The bombarded plant leaves were then grown on spectinomycin-containing plant regeneration media. The shoots regenerated from the media were investigated for the site-specific integration of the transgenes into the chloroplast genome and homoplasmy of the transgenes (absence of untransformed genomes) using Southern blot analysis with the radioisotope-labeled probe spanning trnI and trnA flanking sequences. 26 HindIII-digested chloroplast genomic DNA from 3 independent transplastomic lines for each transplastomic line showed 2 hybridizing fragments at 8.59 and 3.44 kb for CTB-ACE2 because of an internal Hind III site of ACE2 ( Figure 1A ) and a fragment at 9.71 kb for CTB-Ang-(1-7), which confirm the absence of untransformed chloroplast genomes ( Figure 1B and 1C) . Thus, stable integration of the transgenes was confirmed, and the homoplasmic lines were used for further studies. The confirmed homoplasmic lines were multiplied using another round of antibiotic selection under aseptic conditions. Then they were cultivated in a controlled greenhouse for increasing biomass. CTB-ACE2 expression varied between 1.69% and 2.14% of the total leaf proteins ( Figure  1D ), depending on the harvest time because this transgene is regulated by light via the chloroplast psbA promoter. Similarly, the expression level of CTB-Ang-(1-7) varied between 6.0% and 8.7% of total leaf proteins ( Figure 1E ), at different durations of illumination, reaching maximum expression at the end of the day. Hence, for performing in vivo experimental studies, the therapeutic leaf materials were harvested at 6 PM and powdered in liquid nitrogen.\r\n Both the therapeutic proteins were fused to the transmucosal carrier, CTB. The B subunit has a single intrasubunit disulfide bond that stabilizes the CTB monomer. 25 The monomers then assemble to form ring-shaped pentameric structure via intersubunit interactions including hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions. Upon oral administration, only the pentameric form of CTB binds to the gut epithelial GM1 receptor for internalization. 27 Hence, we investigated the proper formation of pentameric structure of the CTB-fused proteins and their binding affinity to GM1 receptor using GM1-ELISA. The binding affinity between CTB pentamers and the receptor was measured spectrophotometrically as a function of absorbance at 450 nm. The therapeutic proteins from the fresh leaf materials showed comparable absorbance to CTB ( Figure 1F ), confirming that chloroplasts form disulfide bridges, fold, and assemble these fusion proteins. We also lyophilized the leaves expressing ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) and evaluated their affinity to the GM1 receptor ( Figure 1F ). Lyophilization not only maintained proper folding, disulfide bond, and pentamer assembly but also facilitated long-term storage at room temperature ( Figure 1F ). Furthermore, the Western blot assay performed under nonreducing conditions without dithiothreitol and boiling showed that there was no monomeric form or cleaved fragments of CTB-Ang-(1-7) ( Figure 1G ). In the Western blot image, the major bands for pentameric assembly of CTB were detected around \u224850 kDa ( Figure 1G , arrow head), and the expected bands for pentameric assembly of CTB-Ang-(1-7) were detected ( Figure 1G , arrow). Therefore, these results confirm that the therapeutic proteins expressed in chloroplasts exist in an intact and pentameric form.\r\n Oral gavage of the frozen powdered leaves (500 mg in sterile phosphate-buffered saline) from untransformed wild type, CTB-ACE2 or CTB-Ang-(1-7) transplastomic plants was performed twice daily for 4 weeks in monocrotaline-challenged rats. Monocrotaline injection caused robust elevation in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP; Figure 2A ) that was associated with the development of RV hypertrophy (RVH; Figure 2B ). In contrast, monocrotaline animals gavaged with either ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) showed considerable reduction in RVSP and RVH (Figure 2A and 2B). Furthermore, measurement of hemodynamic parameters in monocrotaline animals revealed increases in RV end-diastolic pressure (153%), +dP\/ dt (88%), and \u2212dP\/dt (107%). Conversely, treatment with ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) restored all these parameters to near-control levels ( Figure 2C -2E). Echocardiography of monocrotaline rats revealed an increase in the ratio of RV to left ventricle end-diastolic area, implying dilation of the right heart ( Figure 2F ; Figure S1A and S1B in the online-only Data Supplement), which was accompanied with a decrease in ejection fraction (EF), measured as a ratio of RV to left ventricle EF ( Figure 2G ; Figure S1C and S1D). In addition, the pulsed Doppler blood flow measurement revealed decreased flow rate in the RV outflow tract ( Figure 2H ). Furthermore, video of the echocardiography revealed mal-adaptive structural remodeling in monocrotaline rat hearts as compared with controls (Movies SI and SII). However, oral delivery of ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) exhibited improved cardioprotective effects. Both ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) were effective in decreasing RV dilation ( Figure 2F ), increasing EF ( Figure 2G ), and preventing monocrotaline-induced decrease in RV outflow tract blood flow ( Figure 2H ). These beneficial effects were associated with reduced cardiac remodeling as evidenced by echocardiography videos (Movies SIII and SIV). Concurrently, RV fibrosis and pulmonary vessel wall thickness were also decreased ( Figure 3A and 3B). Oral ACE2 feeding was associated with ~37% increase in circulating ACE2 activity compared with monocrotaline alone rats ( Figure 3C ) and a 2fold increase in circulating levels of Ang-(1-7) ( Figure S2 ). Interestingly, ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) did not alter the basal systemic blood pressure (control, 120\u00b15; monocrotaline, 123\u00b17; monocrotaline +ACE2, 118\u00b12; monocrotaline+Ang-(1-7), 116\u00b14; n=5\/ experimental group).\r\n We next tested whether oral feeding of ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) after the initiation of PH could arrest the disease progression. We observed that 2 weeks of monocrotaline challenge induces significant elevation in RVSP (>45 mm Hg) compared with controls ( Figure S3A ). Hence, for this study, oral therapy was initiated after 2 weeks of monocrotaline challenge, and the treatment continued for additional 15 days. This regime of treatment with ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) inhibited further elevation in monocrotaline-induced RVSP and RVH ( Figure 4A and 4B) and was associated with increased circulating levels of Ang-(1-7) ( Figure S2 ). Improvements in hemodynamic parameters with regard to lowering RV end-diastolic pressure, decreasing +dP\/dt, and reducing \u2212dP\/dt were also observed ( Figure S3B-S3D ). In addition, ACE2\/Ang-(1-7) therapy decreased RV dilation ( Figure 4C ; Figure Figure S1A and S1B) and increased RVEF ( Figure 4D ; Figure S1C and S1D), which was supported by echocardiography video (Movies SV and SVI). Subsequently, blood flow in the RV outflow tract was also improved ( Figure 4E ). Finally, RV fibrosis and pulmonary vessel wall thickening were significantly attenuated in the ACE2\/Ang-(1-7)-treated animals ( Figure 4F and 4G).\r\n Next, we evaluated the effects of a combination therapy with ACE2 and Ang-(1-7), wherein 500 mg or 250 mg each of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) plant material was combined. Reversal protocol was followed for this study, wherein the combination therapy was initiated after 2 weeks of monocrotaline challenge, and the treatment continued for the next 15 days. As expected, we observed better protective effects with the 500 mg combination. This combination showed 18% more reduction in RVSP and 25% additional decrease in RV\/(LV +S) ratio compared with the 250 mg combination ( Figure 5A and 5B) . Similarly, enhanced beneficial effects of the 500 mg combination were observed for other hemodynamic parameters such as RV end-diastolic pressure, +dP\/dt, and \u2212dP\/dt ( Figure 5C-5E ). Both doses of the combination therapy were effective in decreasing RV dilatation ( Figure 5F ; Figure S1A and S1B) and increasing EF ( Figure 5G ; Figure S1C and S1D), which was accompanied by greater RV outflow tract blood flow ( Figure 5H ). All these observations were supported by echocardiography video (Movies VII and VIII). Consistent with this were the improvement in RV fibrosis and pulmonary vessel wall thickness after combination therapy ( Figure 6A and 6B ).\r\n We hypothesized that oral delivery of ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) would correct RAS imbalance and inhibit proinflammatory cytokines. Data in Figure 7 support this hypothesis. Monocrotaline rats revealed increased pulmonary mRNA levels of ACE and AT1R ( Figure  7A and 7D), which resulted in 8-fold and 4-fold increases in the ACE\/ACE2 and AT1R\/ AT2R ratios, respectively ( Figure 7C and 7F). Conversely, mRNA levels of ACE2 and AT2R were increased, whereas that of AT1R was decreased in the ACE2 or Ang-(1-7)-fed monocrotaline rats, resulting in decreased ACE\/ACE2 and AT1R\/AT2R ratios. Furthermore, monocrotaline-challenged animals showed increased mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor\u03b1 (4-fold), transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (4-fold), and toll-like receptor-4 (5-fold), all of which were markedly reduced by ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) treatment ( Figure 7G-7I) . Recent reports indicate that the autophagic protein degradation pathway is activated in monocrotaline-challenged animals. 28 Accordingly, we observed that the lung LC3B-II protein, an autophagy marker, was significantly increased in monocrotaline-challenged rats ( Figure 7J ). However, ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) decreased LC3B-II levels, implying inhibition of autophagy. Similar results with respect to RAS modulation, anti-inflammatory properties, and inhibition of autophagy were observed in the reversal protocol with monotherapy [either ACE2 or Ang-(1-7)] or combination therapy ( Figure 8A-8J ).\r\n The most significant finding of our study is that we have developed a system to generate human ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) within plant chloroplasts using transplastomic technology, which when orally administered to rats attenuates PH. Although previous genetic interventions with ACE2\/Ang-(1-7) have demonstrated beneficial effects in animals, 11, 12 there are several challenges that limit the clinical development of such approaches. The incidence of PH is increasing among the elderly global population, necessitating affordable medication for the masses. Although drugs made in plant cells have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and are currently marketed, 25 targeted gene therapy is still in the experimental stage and far away from clinical applications. Even if gene therapy is approved as a valid approach, it would still be accessible to <1% of the global population because of the limited expertise available in hospitals for gene therapy. In contrast, oral delivery of plant capsules containing therapeutic proteins is feasible and much affordable. So, drug delivery is as important as drug discovery, and this study focuses on the development of a novel low-cost delivery system for administering therapeutic proteins like ACE2\/Ang-(1-7), which have been found to be effective against experimental models of lung diseases, but not yet clinically approved. Injectable delivery of ACE2\/Ang-(1-7) poses some unique challenges with respect to cost of manufacturing, protein stability, cold storage, shelf life, sterile delivery, and requirement of health professionals\/hospitals for their administration. Most of these concerns are easily eliminated by orally delivering therapeutic proteins bioencapsulated in plant cells. Currently produced injectable protein drugs are not affordable to more than half of the global population, despite decades of optimization of their process development. By developing an oral delivery system for administering ACE2 and Ang- (1-7) , as reported here, we have made tremendous advancement to move the field forward and take ACE2\/Ang-(1-7) toward translational\/clinical research for the treatment of pulmonary diseases.\r\n ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) were expressed in plant chloroplasts as fusion proteins with CTB. Although Ang-(1-7) is not a gene product, a synthetic gene encoding for Ang-(1-7) was used in this study. 29 Chloroplasts are ideal bioreactors for producing human therapeutic proteins. The total copy number of the transgene per cell is expected to be \u226410 000, resulting in hyperexpression (\u226470% of total leaf protein). 16 A single plant cell has ~ 100 chloroplasts, and each chloroplast has ~100 copies of chloroplast genome. So, \u226410 000 copies of transgene in each transformed plant cell is observed. This copy number has been quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in our previous studies. 30 However, the most practical way in the literature to evaluate homoplasmy (transformation of all chloroplast genomes in each plant cell) is by showing the absence of native untransformed chloroplast genomes as shown in Figure 1B and 1C. Moreover, this system allows for appropriate disulfide bond formation, proper protein folding, and assembly. 17, 18 Also, bio-encapsulation of proteins within plant cells protects them from gastric degradation. Most importantly, when fused with trans-mucosal carriers such as CTB, therapeutic proteins are effectively released into systemic circulation by microbes colonizing the gut, which lyse plant cells, after CTB-GM1 interaction. [18] [19] [20] [21] GM1 is also present on the cell membrane of the retina and nervous system and hence can be targeted by CTB-fused therapeutic proteins, as reported in our recent study. 31, 32 Chloroplasts are capable of producing high level expression of foreign genes. However, the expression levels of \u224893 kDa of ACE2 were below our expectations compared with Ang-(1-7) ( Figure 1C and 1D) . The prokaryotic nature of chloroplast is not well-suited for the expression of eukaryotic human genes because of the bias in codon preference and usage. 33, 34 For example, native prokaryotic genes from Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus thuringiensis were expressed \u226445.3% of the total soluble protein in chloroplasts. 16, 35 Small native human genes such as insulin like growth factor-1 (\u22487.8 kDa), 36 proinsulin (\u224812 kDa), 16 and interferon-\u03b12b (\u224821.5 kDa) 37 were expressed in chloroplasts at high levels. However, larger human native genes like blood clotting factors were expressed in chloroplasts at lower levels. 20 From the analysis of the ACE2 nucleotide sequence, it was observed that 349 codons of 805 were rare codons (43.5%), which would readily exhaust the corresponding tRNA pools, leaving relatively abundant tRNAs unused. Therefore, for clinical development of ACE2, codon optimization and expression in an edible system (lettuce) should be considered.\r\n We have used CTB as the transmucosal carrier to facilitate the uptake of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) into circulation. Both CTB fusion proteins are disulfide bonded, form pentamers, and properly folded, as observed for other CTB fusion proteins. 17, 18 CTB is an approved adjuvant 38 that has been used in several clinical settings. Administration of CTB-fused antigen (Behcet's disease peptide) in humans with autoimmune eye disorders induced immunologic tolerance by suppressing abnormal T-cell reactivity against the peptide. 39 Also, immune suppression to autoantigens (proinsulin and factor IX) linked to CTB has been observed in animal studies after oral administration. 19, 20 Likewise, other studies have shown immune-suppressive effects when CTB was fused to autoimmune or allergic causative agents. 40 The GM1 receptors present on intestinal epithelial cells make CTB the most appropriate carrier for transporting therapeutic proteins into systemic circulation because this receptor is widely distributed over the intestinal mucosa 41,42 with a rapid turnover rate. 43 The half-life of native Ang-(1-7) is short. 44, 45 However, in this study, the stability of Ang-(1-7) was found to increase in sera. In plant cells, CTB stabilizes Ang-(1-7) by formation of pentamers ( Figure 1G ) and thus confers protection from plant proteases. However, only monomers are observed in sera after delivery into the sera. Although furin cleavage site (NH2-R-R-K-R-COOH) should facilitate removal of CTB, efficiency of cleavage depends on the flanking amino acid sequence of the fused protein. 46 Ang-(1-7) fused to CTB did not provide optimal furin cleavage site because it is not flanked by furin preferred basic amino acids at N-terminal side and serine-valine at C-terminal side. Therefore, it is anticipated that furin cleavage will not be rapid or efficient. This offers greater N-terminal protection to Ang-(1-7) and extends its stability for several hours in the sera compared with injectable Ang- (1-7) . Actually, continued treatment with bioencapsulated Ang-(1-7) showed significant increases of the circulating levels of the peptide ( Figure S2 ), which suggests that an oral gavage twice daily of bioencapsulated Ang-(1-7) results in sustained elevated plasma levels of Ang-(1-7) in the treated animals. Ang-(1-7) concentration in frozen leaf materials was found to be 584 \u03bcg\/g, which translates to 292 \u03bcg in 500 mg. This dose compares well with previous studies, wherein 750 to 1000\u03bcg\/kg of Ang-(1-7) peptide was administered to rats (\u2248300 \u03bcg per 300 g rat).\r\n Oral feeding of bioencapsulated ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) prevents the development and, most importantly, retards the progression of monocrotaline-induced PH. An upregulation of the deleterious ACE-angiotensin II-AT1R axis and downregulation of the protective ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis contributes to PH pathogenesis. 47 Thus, maintaining equilibrium between these 2 axes is crucial for preserving pulmonary vascular homeostasis. Oral delivery of ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) increased ACE2\/ACE and decreased AT1R\/AT2R ratios, signifying improvement in pulmonary RAS balance. It was interesting to note that the serum ACE2 activity in monocrotaline animals was decreased compared with controls. This, however, did not affect the circulating levels of Ang-(1-7) , which could possibly be because of alternate endopeptidase pathways of Ang-(1-7) generation through neprilysin or thimet oligopeptidase. However, oral ACE2 feeding prevented the decrease in serum ACE2 activity of monocrotaline animals and was associated with a 2-to 3-fold increase in the circulating levels of Ang-(1-7) ( Figure S2 ). In fact, ACE2 fed rats exhibited 37% increase in the enzymatic activity compared with monocrotaline alone animals. Most importantly, this increase was sufficient to exert beneficial effects against PH pathophysiology. Previous experimental studies have shown that exogenous administration of recombinant ACE2 increases serum ACE2 activity to exert therapeutic efficacy in several disease models. [48] [49] [50] Increasing serum ACE2 levels is also clinically significant because abnormally low levels of serum ACE2 have been associated with PH. 10 Surprisingly, pulmonary ACE2 mRNA levels were increased with oral ACE2 feeding. We speculate this increase to be a positive feed forward mechanism because similar increases in ACE2 have been reported previously. 14, 15 Also, AT2R levels were increased with ACE2 treatment, which is consistent with previous studies showing a protective role of this receptor in cardiopulmonary disease. 51 Furthermore, the favorable RAS modulation by ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) was associated with reduced lung inflammatory cytokines. Proinflammatory cytokines contribute to thickening of the pulmonary arterioles leading to heightened pulmonary pressure. 52 In line with these findings, we observed marked increases in vessel wall thickness in monocrotalinechallenged animals. However, ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) treatment significantly inhibited medial wall thickness. The observed effects of ACE2\/Ang-(1-7) could be attributed to reduction in proinflammatory cytokines, as well as direct antiproliferative actions on the vascular smooth muscle cells, a contention supported by earlier studies. 53 Recent studies have implicated autophagy in PH. 26 We observed an increase in LC3B-II, an autophagy marker, in monocrotaline rats, which was significantly decreased with ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) treatment.\r\n Collectively, aforementioned findings suggest that oral delivery of ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) corrects a dysregulated pulmonary RAS, reduces inflammation, decreases vascular remodeling, and inhibits autophagy to exert lung-protective effects. Importantly, ACE2\/ Ang-(1-7) treatment did not lower basal systemic blood pressure, which is important because induction of systemic hypotension can be detrimental in patients with PH. Similar phenomenon has also been observed in other studies, wherein chronic administration of Ang-(1-7) fails to decrease systemic blood pressure in a variety of models of hypertension. [54] [55] [56] One possibility may be related to pulmonary vasculature being more sensitive to Ang-(1-7) or that abundant receptors for Ang-(1-7) is present on the pulmonary vessels. Furthermore, a combination of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) treatment produced beneficial effects on the cardiopulmonary system. We observed that the higher dose combination yielded better effects than the lower dose.\r\n Of particular interest are the cardioprotective effects of oral ACE2\/Ang-(1-7) therapy. Sustained pressure overload on the right heart induces ventricular remodeling and dysfunction. 57 Echocardiography of monocrotaline rats revealed prominent structural changes in the heart. The RV assumed a round shape, with a shift in the intraventricular septum causing RV dilation with reduced EF. In addition, the pulmonary artery flow was significantly lowered in the monocrotaline group. All these changes were associated with development of RVH, increased interstitial fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction. However, ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) treatment restored normal heart structure, inhibited RV dilatation, and improved EF. Also, RVH and interstitial fibrosis were significantly reduced, along with preserved cardiac function. Moreover, the combination therapy with ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) was found to exert superior cardioprotective effects.\r\n Evidences have implicated the therapeutic potential of the ACE2\/Ang-(1-7) axis in multiple diseases such as PH, lung-fibrosis, heart failure, renal diseases, and diabetic retinopathy. This study provides proof-of-concept for a low-cost plant-based oral delivery system for ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) bioencapsulated in plant chloroplasts. This transplastomic technology offers the potential to scale-up and generate bulk quantities of therapeutically active ACE2\/ Ang-(1-7) toward undertaking translational studies with a simple oral delivery system. In this direction, we have lyophilized leaves expressing ACE2 or Ang-(1-7), which have concentrated these therapeutic proteins by \u224820.5and 14.3-fold, respectively, with no loss of the binding affinity to GM1 receptor ( Figure 1F ). The concentration effect is because of the packaging of more proteins per milligram of lyophilized leaves as a result of elimination of water by dehydration. So this process does not change the percentage of ACE2\/Ang1-7 in the total leaf protein between fresh and lyophilized plant leaves. This freeze-drying method is also advantageous in that it reduces the cost associated with protein purification, eliminates microbial contamination, and facilitates long-term storage of these therapeutic proteins in capsules at room temperature, which are all important considerations for clinical development.\r\n Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\r\n What Is New?\r\n \u2022 This study provides evidence for the first time the development of a low-cost oral delivery system for the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin-(1-7) using transplastomic technology that provides impressive protection against pulmonary hypertension.\r\n What Is Relevant?\r\n \u2022 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin-(1-7) have tremendous therapeutic potential for treating pulmonary hypertension. However, cost of manufacturing, protein stability, repetitive intravenous dosing, and patient compliance pose major impediments for successful clinical therapy. Development of a plant-based oral delivery system will overcome these challenges to realize full therapeutic potential of these proteins.\r\n Oral delivery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or angiotensin-(1-7) bioencapsulated in plant cells provides protection against pulmonary hypertension and associated cardiopulmonary pathology.

We think that development of a plant-based oral delivery system will be an ideal approach to overcome these aforementioned challenges and achieve clinical success. The online-only Data Supplement includes detailed descriptions of all the methods and additional supporting data. Hinge (Gly-Pro-Gly-Pro) and furin cleavage site (Arg-Arg-Lys-Arg) were placed between CTB and therapeutic proteins ( Figure 1A ) to eliminate steric hindrance and aid systemic release of these therapeutic proteins after they are internalized via ligand-receptor complex formation on the surface of epithelial cells. To select the chloroplast transformed with the fusion genes, aminoglycoside-3\u2033-adenylyl-transferase gene (aadA), driven by the chloroplast ribosomal RNA promoter (Prrn), was incorporated into the expression cassette to confer the transformants resistance to spectinomycin ( Figure 1A ). The confirmed homoplasmic lines were multiplied using another round of antibiotic selection under aseptic conditions. CTB-ACE2 expression varied between 1.69% and 2.14% of the total leaf proteins ( Figure  1D ), depending on the harvest time because this transgene is regulated by light via the chloroplast psbA promoter. Hence, for performing in vivo experimental studies, the therapeutic leaf materials were harvested at 6 PM and powdered in liquid nitrogen. Upon oral administration, only the pentameric form of CTB binds to the gut epithelial GM1 receptor for internalization. The therapeutic proteins from the fresh leaf materials showed comparable absorbance to CTB ( Figure 1F ), confirming that chloroplasts form disulfide bridges, fold, and assemble these fusion proteins. Conversely, treatment with ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) restored all these parameters to near-control levels ( Figure 2C -2E). However, oral delivery of ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) exhibited improved cardioprotective effects. These beneficial effects were associated with reduced cardiac remodeling as evidenced by echocardiography videos (Movies SIII and SIV). We observed that 2 weeks of monocrotaline challenge induces significant elevation in RVSP (>45 mm Hg) compared with controls ( Figure S3A ). Hence, for this study, oral therapy was initiated after 2 weeks of monocrotaline challenge, and the treatment continued for additional 15 days. This regime of treatment with ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) inhibited further elevation in monocrotaline-induced RVSP and RVH ( Figure 4A and 4B) and was associated with increased circulating levels of Ang-(1-7) ( Figure S2 ). Similarly, enhanced beneficial effects of the 500 mg combination were observed for other hemodynamic parameters such as RV end-diastolic pressure, +dP\/dt, and \u2212dP\/dt ( Figure 5C-5E ). Both doses of the combination therapy were effective in decreasing RV dilatation ( Figure 5F ; Figure S1A and S1B) and increasing EF ( Figure 5G ; Figure S1C and S1D), which was accompanied by greater RV outflow tract blood flow ( Figure 5H ). Consistent with this were the improvement in RV fibrosis and pulmonary vessel wall thickness after combination therapy ( Figure 6A and 6B ). Data in Figure 7 support this hypothesis. Similar results with respect to RAS modulation, anti-inflammatory properties, and inhibition of autophagy were observed in the reversal protocol with monotherapy [either ACE2 or Ang-(1-7)] or combination therapy ( Figure 8A-8J ). The incidence of PH is increasing among the elderly global population, necessitating affordable medication for the masses. Even if gene therapy is approved as a valid approach, it would still be accessible to <1% of the global population because of the limited expertise available in hospitals for gene therapy. So, drug delivery is as important as drug discovery, and this study focuses on the development of a novel low-cost delivery system for administering therapeutic proteins like ACE2\/Ang-(1-7), which have been found to be effective against experimental models of lung diseases, but not yet clinically approved. Although Ang-(1-7) is not a gene product, a synthetic gene encoding for Ang-(1-7) was used in this study. 29 Chloroplasts are ideal bioreactors for producing human therapeutic proteins. 16 A single plant cell has ~ 100 chloroplasts, and each chloroplast has ~100 copies of chloroplast genome. 17, 18 Also, bio-encapsulation of proteins within plant cells protects them from gastric degradation. 18] [19] [20] [21] GM1 is also present on the cell membrane of the retina and nervous system and hence can be targeted by CTB-fused therapeutic proteins, as reported in our recent study. 47 Thus, maintaining equilibrium between these 2 axes is crucial for preserving pulmonary vascular homeostasis. It was interesting to note that the serum ACE2 activity in monocrotaline animals was decreased compared with controls. However, oral ACE2 feeding prevented the decrease in serum ACE2 activity of monocrotaline animals and was associated with a 2-to 3-fold increase in the circulating levels of Ang-(1-7) ( Figure S2 ). Most importantly, this increase was sufficient to exert beneficial effects against PH pathophysiology. 14, 15 Also, AT2R levels were increased with ACE2 treatment, which is consistent with previous studies showing a protective role of this receptor in cardiopulmonary disease. Proinflammatory cytokines contribute to thickening of the pulmonary arterioles leading to heightened pulmonary pressure. The observed effects of ACE2\/Ang-(1-7) could be attributed to reduction in proinflammatory cytokines, as well as direct antiproliferative actions on the vascular smooth muscle cells, a contention supported by earlier studies. 53 Recent studies have implicated autophagy in PH.

In order to gain insight into its pathogenesis, we have focused on an mRNA encoding the major mucus glycoprotein, mucin. Northern blots showed that mucin mRNA was abundant in the intestine of specific pathogen free rats whereas it was undetectable in the airways of these rats until pathogen-free conditions were suspended and rats acquired Sendal (Parainfluenza I) virus infections. Airway mucin hybridization signals in rats that were both infected with Sendai virus and exposed to SO2 were more intense than those in rats with infection alone. These results suggest that pathogen-and irritant-induced hypersecretion may be partly controlled at the level ofmucin mRNA.\r\n Mucus hypersecretion is a common response of the pulmonary airways to infection or injury and is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and asthma [1]. In these conditions, excessive mucus accumulates in the air passages, compromising airflow to the lung, causing respiratory insufficiency, and sometimes death [2], [3], [4] . The pathophysiology of hyperseeretion is likely to involve abnormalities at control points regulating the production of the major mucus glycoprotein, mucin. These abnormalities could occur at the level of transcription, processing, or stability of RNA transcripts, as well as translation, processing, or stability of the protein. Some of the most common mechanisms modulating protein biosynthesis act by regulating RNA steady state, either by altering the transcription or degradation rate of specific mRNAs [5] .\r\n To determine whether mucin mRNA steady state varies under conditions of infection and irritation, we monitored airway mucin mRNA steady state by Northern blot in specific pathogen-flee (SPF) rats, rats acquiring respiratory tract infections, and rats exposed to the irritant SO2. The results clearly showed that airway mucin mRNA steady state increases in the presence of infection and irritation. A preliminary report has appeared [6].","text_body":"accessible ad libitum.

Non-exposed time control rats were sacrificed immediately after arrival from the vendor or after living for three weeks in the animal colony.\r\n Rats were assigned to experimental and control groups for RNA analysis as follows: unexposed 0 time=5 rats (Fig. 3, Group D) ; unexposed 3 weeks=4 rats (Fig. 3, Group B ); SO2 exposed 1 week=2 rats (Fig. 3 , Group C); SO2 exposed 2 weeks=2 rats (Fig. 3 , Group C); SO2 exposed 3 weeks=3 rats (Fig. 3 , Group C; sham exposed 3 weeks=2 rats (Fig. 3, Group A) .

Osmication was in 2% OsO4 in 0.14 M Na veronal and block staining was in uranyl acetate in 0.2 M Na maleate buffer, pH 5.2. Tissue was dehydrated in graded ethanols, passed through propylene oxide, and embedded in Medcast resin. Silver sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and photographed in a Zeiss EM 10 electron microscope.\r\n Serum antibody titer determination: Serum was taken from rats upon sacrifice and was assayed by ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) for antibodies against M. pulmonis, Corona and Sendai (Parainfluenza 1) viruses, PVM, KRV, Toolan H-l, and CAR Bacillus by Microbiological Associates, Inc. (Bethesda, MD).\r\n For RNA analysis, the tracheobronchial tree, as well as the intestine and heart, were removed from anesthetized rats. RNA was extracted as previously described [9] . Ten micrograms of total RNA per lane were electrophoresed through denaturing agarose\/formaldehyde gels, transferred to GeneScreen membranes, and hybridized to the [32p]_ labeled human intestinal mucin eDNA, SMUC 41 [10] . Washing conditions were 0.2 x SSC (2 x SSC = 0.3 M sodium chloride, 0.03 M sodium citrate), 1% SDS, 63\u00b0C, 30'. After washing, blots were exposed to X-OMAT film (Kodak). Blots were stripped and re-probed with a [32p]_ labeled beta-actin cDNA.\r\n As shown in Figure 1 , the airways of rats exposed to SO2 for three weeks contained numerous mucous (goblet) cells. These were similar to those seen in human chronic bronchitis [2] . Secretions adhering to the apical surfaces of airway epithelial cells were also present in SO2exposed, but not SPF control rats (Fig. 1) .\r\n In order to monitor mucin mRNA levels in the airways of experimental and control rats, it was necessary to identify a mucin eDNA that hybridized with rat mucin mRNA. At the time we began our studies, mucin cDNAs had been isolated from eDNA libraries constructed from the human intestine [10] , pig submaxillary [11] , and human mammary [12] , [13] , [14] glands. The similarity between the amino acid compositions of intestinal and airway mucins [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] led us to test the feasibility of using an intestinal cDNA for our studies.\r\n Our initial studies revealed a high degree of homology between mucin mRNAs in the intestine and the airway of man [19] . Using the intestinal mucin cDNA SMUC 41 as a probe, we isolated HAM-l, a close homologue of SMUC 41 containing threonine-and proline-rich tandem repeats, from a human airway eDNA library [19] . Although we initially expected the human airway mucin eDNA to be more favorable for probing rat airways than the human intestinal mucin eDNA, the larger size of SMUC-41 made it more favorable. Using SMUC-41 in Northern blots, we probed RNA from two rat mucin-secreting organs (intestine and airways), and used RNA from a non-mucin secreting organ (heart) as a negative control. In Northern blots, the intestinal (Fig. 2) and airway (Fig. 3 ) signals were polydisperse, a distinguishing feature of mucin mRNA [10] [19] [20] corresponding to polydispersity in the size of nascent [21] and deglycosylated [18] mucin peptides. The integrity of the RNA was confirmed by reprobing blots with a beta actin eDNA (Figs. 2 and 3, lower panel). RNA from the heart and airways of specific pathogen-free rats was negative ( Figure 2, and D lanes, Fig 3) . The airway negativity is consistent with studies showing the paucity of mucous cells and mucin glycoprotein in the airways of specific pathogen-free rats (Fig 1, control, [22] , [23] ) as well as in healthy dogs [24] , [25] and humans [26] .\r\n The failure of SMUC-41 to hybridize to RNA from SPF rat airways was conspicuously reversed when rats were housed in the Animal Colony under non-pathogen-free conditions and exposed for 1-3 weeks to SO2 (Fig. 3 , C lanes) or air alone (Fig.3, A lanes) . Serum from each rat was tested (see Table) for the presence of antibodies directed against PVM, Sendai virus, Corona virus, KRV, Toolan H-l, M. pulmonis, and CAR Bacillus. We found that all rats with significant antibody titers for Sendal virus [27] , [28] , [29] (Fig. 3) showed mucin hybridization signals.\r\n SPF rats (Fig. 3 , D lanes and the bronchus lane in Figure 2 ) as well as those infected by another pathogen (i.e. Corona virus, Fig. 3 , B lanes) did not. Mucin hybridization signals obtained from airway RNA of Sendai virus-infected rats that were exposed to SO2 for 1 wk showed signals more intense than those from rats with infection alone (Fig. 3, C lanes) .\r\n We have shown that a human intestinal mucin cDNA, SMUC-41, is homologous to mucin mRNA in the intestine and airways of the rat. This homology enabled us to use SMUC-41 to monitor rat mucin mRNA and to discover that a SMUC mucin gene analogue is constitutively Rats sham-exposed to air, housed in laboratory 3 wk; (B) rats housed in animal colony 3 wk; (C) rats exposed to SO2, 1, 2, or 3 wk, housed in laboratory, (D) rats sacrificed immediately upon arrival from vendor (D). Each lane represents an individual animal (6, 17) . \"+\" = significant antibody titer or SO2-exposure; \"--\" = no significant antibody titer or SO2-exposure; \"O\" = antibody titer not determined. For a complete list of pathogens assayed, see Table 1 . = 10 lag total RNA was loaded per lane. Blots were hybridized to [32P]-labeled SMUC 41 as described above, exposed to X-OMAT film (Kodak), stripped, and reprobed with a beta-actin cDNA.\r\n expressed in the intestine of SPF rats, but requires activation by infection or injury in order to be expressed in the airways.\r\n As in human tissues [10] [19] , the rat intestine and airway yielded large, polydisperse signals when hybridized with SMUC 41. The polydispersity could not be explained by overall RNA degradation since reprobing with a beta actin probe consistently produced crisp hybridization bands (Fig 3) . Polydispersity in the size of deglycosylated mucin polypeptides [ 18] suggests that polydisperse transcripts are functional. Such transcripts could arise through alternative splicing [30] , although partial degradation of message during RNA turnover [31] cannot be excluded.\r\n The constitutive expression of mucin mRNA in the rat intestine (Fig 2) is not surprising in light of the necessity in that organ for continuous lubrication. On the other hand, mucin and mucin mRNA may be only minimally produced in airways except in specific response to insult or injury.\r\n Mucin appears to be present in low abundance in the airways of healthy dogs [25] and humans [26] but is present in high abundance in the airways of chronic bronchitics [26] or dogs exposed to tobacco smoke [25] . Our results are consistent with these data as well as with data showing that mucous cells are rare in the airways of SPF rats [23] , [22] but increase when airways become injured [7] , [32] or infected [22] . The particularly high abundance of mucin mRNA observed after one week SO2 exposure is intriguing; the diminution at two and three weeks occurs while mucous (goblet) cell numbers remain elevated. This may indicate that during the early stages of injury, goblet cells rapidly discharge and resynthesize mucin, but in the later stages, tolerance occurs and ceils are relatively quiescent.\r\n The resuks of our study suggest that one of the molecular events reponsible for converting a low-mucin-secreting to a high-mucin-secreting epithelium is the induction of mucin mRNA. The increased mucin mRNA steady state does not seem to occur secondary to mucous cell mitosis because mucous cells (containing electron lucent secretory granules) do not incorporate [3H]thymidine during the period of mucin mRNA induction [33] . Further, mucous cells have not been observed to incorporate [3H] thymidine during the period of rapid mucous cell increase following cigarette smoke exposure [34] . We suggest that the increased numbers of mucous cells in injured airways arise through environmental stimulation of mucin gene transcription, presumably an early event in mucous cell differentiation.\r\n Our studies revealed that the airways of SPF rats contained undetectable mucin mRNA, as determined by lack of hybridization with SMUC-41. Under the housing conditions used in our studies, rats spontaneously became infected with Sendai virus, Corona virus, or CAR bacillus.\r\n Those infected by Sendai virus were the only rats to show mucin hybridization signals, and all rats with significant antibody titers against Sendai virus showed conspicuous signals ( Figure 3 and Table 1 ). Although correlation does not prove causality, these data strongly suggest that Sendai virus is responsible for the marked induction seen in our experiments. Although we cannot rule out potential roles of other pathogens, the rarity of rat pathogens other than those screened for makes it unlikely that an undetected pathogen accounted for the induction.\r\n Although Sendai virus-infected rats showed conspicuous hybridization signals, they were much less intense than those seen in two animals simultaneously infected with Sendal virus and exposed for 1 wk to the irritant SO2 (Fig 3, C lanes, 1 week exposure) . The relative intensities of the signals suggest that mucin mRNA induction by Sendal virus may be potentiated by SO2. Highly prevalent in rodent colonies [27] , Sendai virus is known to induce a variety of structural and functional alterations in the respiratory tract [27] . Based on our results, these may include mucin mRNA induction. Although the specific mechanisms by which pathogens (and possibly irritants) induce mucin mRNA are unknown, such mechanisms would likely act to increase the transcription rate or decrease the degradation rate of mucin mRNA. Viruses may activate the expression of multiple gene products through induction of interferons [35] . Further, irritation can introduce macrophage-, neutrophil-, and lymphocyte-derived mediators to the environment [2] [36] [37] . These could potentially stimulate epithelial cells to synthesize or activate transcription factors [31] or could influence the processing of specific mRNAs to affect their stability [30] .\r\n Although infection and irritation have long been known to initiate mucus hypersecretion in animals and humans [38] , the underlying mechanisms have remained obscure. In demonstrating that pathogens and irritants are capable of affecting mucus secretion at the level of mucin mRNA, our results provide one of the first clues to the pathogenesis of hypersecretion.","sha":"96174bec110bfcd670e31e1297aeabb341c6ce29","publish_time":"1991-11-27","authors":"Jany, Berthold; Gallup, Marianne; Tsuda, Tohru; Basbaum, Carol","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","doi":"10.1016\/s0006-291x(05)81373-7","Title":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","H index":243.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"SOg-exoosed rats were exposed in plexiglass chambers to 400 ppm sulfur dioxide gas in air for 3 h\/if, 5 ~week, for 1 to 3 wk [7] .

The integrity of the RNA was confirmed by reprobing blots with a beta actin eDNA (Figs.

Effective delivery of the siRNA to the site of action is hindered by many biological barriers i.e. bifurcations in the lung, mucociliary clearance, lung surfactant etc. [1, 2] . Once across these barriers, a number of additional factors have to be taken into consideration. SiRNA is quickly inactivated by RNases and macrophages. Hence, siRNA has been condensed or encapsulated with nonviral siRNA carriers to afford its protection against host defences. The requirements for efficient lung deposition are generally defined as appropriate aerodynamic mean diameter of droplets or dry powders in the range of 1-5 \u00b5m [3] , and sufficient stability of carriers to allow nebulization [4] . Once deposited in the lung, siRNA complex sizes should have a particle diameter less than 200 nm to avoid macrophage phagocytosis [5, 6] .\r\n In an effort to enhance gene silencing, various non-viral carriers for siRNA delivery have been developed. Most of them are based on liposomal formulations or positively charged polycations, which are non-biodegradable [7, 8] . Liposomal formulations have been shown to be poor siRNA carriers for pulmonary gene delivery [7] , possibly due to the surfactants inherent in the lung [9, 10] .\r\n The design of biodegradable polymeric materials has become an important objective to avoid acute toxicity and accumulation of nanocarriers in the lung after administration [11] . SiRNA polyplexes formed with biodegradable poly(amino ester glycol urethane) were shown to display low cytotoxicity. Combined with a fast siRNA release, these siRNA polyplexes lead to efficient gene silencing in vitro [12] . Recent studies reported chitosan as a potential carrier for siRNA delivery, however none of them investigated the degradation in correlation with siRNA release and knockdown efficiency [13] [14] [15] . Poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles were most frequently used for encapsulation of peptides, proteins and pDNA. The breakdown of PLGA leads to acidic degradation products, lactic and glycolic acid, which can cause DNA degradation and damage [16] . These nanoparticles were not able to mediate pronounced DNA transfection efficiency possibly due to poor encapsulation, low cellular uptake, insufficient lysosomal escape, or as previously mentioned, DNA degradation [17] .\r\n In an attempt to overcome these drawbacks, branched biodegradable polyesters were designed by attaching hydrophilic, positively charged amine groups onto a hydrophilic water-soluble backbone consisting of poly(vinyl alcohol) which was subsequently grafted with multiple PLGA side chains [18] . In this study we focused on a derivative of poly(vinyl 3-(dialkylamino) alkylcarbamate-co-vinyl acetate-co-vinyl alcohol)-graft-poly-(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) containing diethylaminopropylamine (DEAPA) as amine function with composition DEAPA(68)-PVA-PLGA (1:10), abbreviated as P(68)-10. [19] . This polymer was found to be useful for pDNA containing nanoparticles [20] showing surprisingly high transfection efficiencies. The mechanism of transfection does not rely on the proton-sponge effect of the backbone [21] but rather on the rapid degradation rates. The biocompatibility of P(68)-10 was found to be superior to poly (ethylene imine) [22] and the acute toxicity and inflammatory response of P(68)-10 nanoparticles after pulmonary application was comparatively low [23] . The degradation rates and profiles are affected by the polymer structure and very rapid degradation rates can be achieved [24] .\r\n In this study we investigated the hypothesis that nanoparticles generated from rapidly biodegradable polymers could be advantageous for intra-cellular siRNA delivery. These nanoparticles were prepared by a modified solvent displacement method to encapsulate siRNA into biodegradable P(68)-10 under mild conditions. These nano-carriers were then characterized with respect to cytotoxicity, transfection efficiency and nebulization properties to assess their potential as pulmonary delivery system for siRNA.\r\n Biodegradable branched polyesters DEAPA-(68)-PVA-PLGA (1:10), abbreviated as P(68)-10, were synthesized and characterized as previously described [19] . The anti-luciferase siRNA: 5\u2032-GAUUAUGUCCGGUUAUGUA-3\u2032 (cat. No. D-002050-01-20) and siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA #3 (cat. no. D-001210-03-20) was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA). Lipofectamine 2000 was obtained from Invitrogen (CA, USA).\r\n Nanoparticles were prepared using a solvent displacement method, described by Jung et al. [25] . Briefly, 5 mg of P(68)-10 were dissolved in 500 \u00b5l of dry acetone with stirring for 48 h. In a sterile laminar flow hood, 20 \u00b5l siRNA (0.25 \u00b5g\/\u00b5l) was dispersed into a 100 \u00b5l P(68)-10 acetone solution. For polymer ratios in the range of 6:1-20:1 N:P ratios, the amount of polymer ranges from 240-790 \u00b5g (P(68)-10 has 1 tertiary amine per 2513 Da). This mixture was immediately injected into a 400 \u00b5l of a 0.1% poloxamer (Pluronic F-68, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) aqueous solution, whereupon the solution immediately turned opalescent. The acetone was removed from the nanoparticle suspensions by evaporation under laminar flow for 3 h or by a 50 mTorr vacuum pump for 20 min.\r\n SiRNA nanoparticles were filtered from the 0.1% poloxamer solution (1.0 ml) using preweighed 47 mm 0.02 \u00b5m Whatman filter discs. The filter discs were washed once with 2 ml of distilled water and allowed to dry under vacuum to constant weight to determine the concentration of the nanoparticles in suspension. The supernatant was analyzed for siRNA concentration by an ethidium bromide intercalation assay after 15 min incubation with 50 IU of heparin. Twenty \u00b5l of a 0.0125 mg\/ml ethidium bromide solution was added. Fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (LS 50 B, Perkin Elmer, Rodgau-J\u00fcgesheim, Germany) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 518 nm and 605 nm, respectively. Amount of siRNA was calculated by a calibration curve ranging from 0.0156 \u00b5g-0.75 \u00b5g siRNA. Experiments were carried out in triplicate.\r\n The prepared nanoparticle suspension (200 \u00b5l) was pipetted directly onto the membrane of a sterilized Aeroneb Laboratory Nebulizer. The aerosol was collected and condensed using a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube pressed to the bottom of the nebulizer. Typical recoveries of the aerosol were N70%. Experiments were carried out in quadruplicate.\r\n Nanoparticle suspension was diluted 1:5 with 0.9% NaCl solution. The diluted solution (600 \u00b5l) was placed into the Aeroneb Laboratory Nebulizer. A stream of nitrogen (10 l\/min) was used to propel the aerosol through the laser beam of the Fraunhofer Laser Diffractor, and six measurements were taken of each formulation. Sodium chloride 0.9% served as control. Droplet sizes are expressed as mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD).\r\n 2.6. Measurement of particle size and zeta-potential Hydrodynamic diameter of nanoparticle suspensions was measured by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) using the Zetasizer, Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments (Herrenberg, Germany). Nanoparticles were prepared in a total volume of 200 \u00b5l at different N\/P ratios containing 200 pmol of siRNA. For determination of the zeta-potential the nanoparticle suspension was further diluted in either distilled water or HEPES buffered glucose (HBG) (5% Glucose buffered with 10 mM HEPES). All measurements are given as mean values of three independent runs and performed in triplicate.\r\n To study the nanoparticle stability against anions a heparin competition assay was performed. Heparin was dissolved in 10 \u00b5l pure water to obtain concentrations ranging from 0.05-2 IU per \u00b5g siRNA and added to 40 \u00b5l of nanoparticle suspension, Lipofectamine\/siRNA or PEI 25 kDa\/siRNA polyplex solution. After incubation for 15 min at RT all solutions were filled to a final volume of 180 \u00b5l and mixed with 20 \u00b5l of a 0.0125 mg\/ml ethidium bromide solution. Fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (LS 50 B, Perkin Elmer, Rodgau-J\u00fcgesheim, Germany) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 518 nm and 605 nm, respectively. Free siRNA was calculated by a calibration curve ranging from 0.0156 \u00b5g-0.75 \u00b5g siRNA. Results are given as means of triplicate measurements.\r\n Nanoparticle suspensions (100 \u00b5l, 10:1 N:P ratio, containing Anti-Luc siRNA) were diluted 1:5 with phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 in a low volume Eppendorf UVette. Hydrodynamic diameter and light scattering (kilo counts per second, kcps) measurements were taken every 7 min at 37\u00b0C using the Zetasizer, Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments. Each time point was measured in sextuplet, 10 s per measurement with total measurements up to 500 min. For siRNA release studies at pH 7.4, 800 \u00b5l of nanoparticle suspensions (N:P ratio of 10:1) were diluted with phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 to a total volume of 4000 \u00b5l and incubated at 37\u00b0C. At different time points (0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 h and 8 h) aliquots of 400 \u00b5l nanoparticle suspension were centrifuged at 16,000 \u00d7g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was separated from the supernatant and incubated with 50 IU. of heparin for 20 min. SiRNA was then quantified using the ethidium bromide intercalation assay as described in 'Efficiency of nanoparticle formation and siRNA encapsulation'. The values were calculated as mean \u00b1 SD of three experiments.\r\n H1299 luc cells, stably expressing luciferase, were cultured in RPMI medium, supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours before transfection, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 0.6 \u00d7 10 4 per well. Nanoparticles were prepared as described above and 5-20 \u00b5l (5-20 pmol siRNA) of the suspension were added to each well containing 100 \u00b5l fresh RPMI. After 4 h of incubation the medium was replaced and the cells were allowed to grow for 44 h. In addition to the anti-luc siRNA, a non-silencing siRNA sequence was used to ensure that the decrease in luciferase expression is due to the anti-luciferase siRNA and not to cytotoxicity effects or the vector. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) was used as a positive control for siRNA delivery and was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase gene silencing activity was measured according to the protocol provided by Promega (Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, cells were lysed in 100 \u00b5l cell culture lysis buffer for 15 min. Luciferase activity was quantified by injection of 50 \u00b5l luciferase assay buffer, containing 10 mM luciferin, to 20 \u00b5l of the cell lysate. The relative light units (RLU) were measured with a plate luminometer (LumiSTAR Optima, BMG Labtech GMBH, Offenburg, Germany). All experiments were performed in quadruplicates and data were expressed as percentage of control (untreated cells).\r\n Twenty-four hours before transfection, H1299 luc cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 0.6 \u00d7 10 4 per well. Nanoparticle suspensions were serially diluted in RPMI\/10% fetal bovine serum from 1 mg\/ml to 0.004 mg\/ml (total of nine concentrations). Quadruplicate measurements were made for each concentration using 100 \u00b5l of the diluted suspensions and allowed to incubate 24 h in the H1299 luc cells. Medium was removed and 200 \u00b5l RPMI plus 20 \u00b5l of 2 mg\/ml MTT (3-(,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dephenyltetrazolium bromide) solution was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. MTT medium was removed and formazan was dissolved using 200 \u00b5l DMSO. Absorbance was measured at 560 nm and background at 670 nm was subtracted. Cell viability = nanoparticle concentration absorbance \/ blank cell absorbance \u00d7 100. Data are presented as a mean of four measurements. LD 50 was calculated using the Boltzman sigmoidal function from Microcal Origin\u00ae v 7.0 (OriginLab, Northampton, USA).\r\n The hemolytic activity of nanoparticles and polyplexes was investigated as reported earlier [26] . Briefly, human erythrocytes were isolated from fresh citrated blood from a healthy volunteer by centrifugation at 850 \u00d7g. Red blood cells were washed in PBS until the supernatant was clear. Erythrocytes were diluted with PBS to 5 \u00d7 10 8 cells\/ml. Nanoparticle suspensions were prepared as explained in 'Preparation of nanoparticle suspension'. PBS and 1% Triton X-100 in PBS were used as controls for 0% lysis and 100% lysis, respectively. 50 \u00b5l aliquots of nanoparticle suspensions were mixed with 50 \u00b5l erythrocyte suspension. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C under constant shaking. After centrifugation at 850 \u00d7g, supernatant was analyzed for hemoglobin release at 541 nm.\r\n Significance between the mean values was calculated using unpaired Student's t-tests. Probability values P b 0.05 were marked with \u204e, P b 0.01 were marked with \u204e\u204e and P b 0.001 were marked with \u204e\u204e\u204e.\r\n The P(68)-10 polymer was prepared and characterized as described by Wittmar et al. [19] . Physical properties of the P(68)-10 were M w = 1055 kDa, M n = 374 kDa, PDI = 2.82, and T g = 15\u00b0C.\r\n Nanoparticle suspensions were prepared by dissolving the P(68)-10 polymer (Fig. 1 , non-water soluble) into acetone and siRNA (dissolved in buffer) was then injected directly into the acetone solution. The solution immediately turned opalescent from nanoparticle formation, a phenomenon also known as the Marangoni effect [27] . The formation of nanoparticles by the solvent displacement method offered several benefits over traditional methods. For example, high speed mixing was avoided, which prevented shear forces on siRNA or the nanoparticles. Solvent displacement also allowed the scale of the nanoparticle formation to be modified from large batch sizes to small volumes such as 50 \u00b5l siRNA nanoparticles. The removal of acetone under reduced pressure allows faster preparation and did not affect the nanoparticles in terms of hydrodynamic diameter, zeta-potential, or transfection.\r\n Investigation on efficiency of nanoparticle formation and siRNA encapsulation showed that for the P(68)-10 polymer at a 10:1 N:P (nitrogen to phosphate) ratio, 98 \u00b1 2% formed nanoparticles that could be filtered by the 0.02 \u00b5m filter. The supernatant contained 7 \u00b1 2% of the total siRNA which translates into an association of 93 \u00b1 2% of the injected siRNA into the P(68)-10 nanoparticles. This compares favourably with other formulations such as chitosan coated PLGA nanoparticles where only 51% of siRNA was encapsulated [28] . The P (68)-10 nanoparticles had similar encapsulation efficiencies for oligonucleotides as liposomes (80-90%) [29] as well as chitosan-TPP encapsulated nanoparticles (100%) [15] .\r\n 3.2. Physico-chemical properties P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles Nanoparticle formulations were prepared by varying the ratio between the amine functions on the polymer backbone and the phosphate groups in siRNA, abbreviated as N:P ratio. The nanoparticle size and surface charges were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta-potential respectively. With increasing N:P ratios, the sizes increased from 150 nm (N:P 6:1) to 225 nm (N:P 20:1), as seen in Fig. 2A . This observation is most likely due to the higher polymer concentration in the organic phase, when using higher N:P ratios. Quintanar-Guerrero and co-workers studied the factors controlling nanoparticle size by the solvent displacement methods [30, 31] . Their results demonstrate that polymer concentration in the organic phase affects particle sizes-the higher the concentration, the larger the particle size. The siRNA concentration and acetone volume were constant, and only the concentration of the P(68)-10 polymer was changed to yield different N:P ratios. Overall, the type of siRNA (anti-luc siRNA or non-specific) did not influence the size, as expected.\r\n Zeta-potentials for the P(68)-10 nanoparticles only varied by salt concentration. The zeta-potential did not vary with N:P ratio, presence or absence of siRNA, particle size or polymer injection methods (i.e. syringe versus plastic pipette tip injection). At solute\/salt concentrations of b10 mM the zeta-potential was always seen in the range of 40-50 mV. When the nanoparticle suspension was diluted with isotonic saline solutions, the zeta-potential went down to 15-20 mV.\r\n The stability of any siRNA carrier is always of utmost importance, as a possible therapeutic formulation would have to have the same integrity when formulated as when it would be used several hours later. To monitor the integrity of P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles, DLS measurements were recorded for 12 h on a freshly prepared sample of 10:1 N:P nanoparticle suspension (0.1% poloxamer, pH 5.2) containing the anti-luc siRNA. Fig. 2B demonstrated that nanoparticle suspensions did not aggregate or display gross degradation throughout the 12 h incubation period at 25\u00b0C. The hydrodynamic diameter remained constant, as the starting particle size of 166 nm was very close to the particle size of 161 nm at the end of the experiment. A slight increase in the scattering intensity was seen, but most likely resulted from solvent evaporation. The stability of these nanoparticles allowed a time flexibility for characterization and transfection experiments that is often not possible with polyplexes and lipoplexes. For example, the Lipofectamine 2000\/siRNA lipoplexes need to be used within 30 min for optimum gene knockdown [32] . The P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles displayed no noticeable differences in transfection within the 12 h of preparation (data not shown). Future experiments will explore long long-term stability of the P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles and the effect on in vitro transfection.\r\n Nebulization of the P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles was carried out using an Aeroneb Laboratory Nebulizer. This device uses an ultrasonic vibrating mesh to nebulize aqueous medium. Aerosol nebulizers have an advantage over air-jet nebulizers because of their higher output, which results in less shear forces due to nominal exposure time for oligonucleotides [4] . The ultrasonic energy has been known to alter or undermine aerosolized drug formulations [33, 34] . Thus, P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles were characterized before and after nebulization, as seen in Fig. 3 . The lowest ratio of N:P was affected the most by the nebulization. The 6:1 N:P ratio had a 37% increase in the hydrodynamic diameter and the zeta-potential had a larger increase in the standard deviation. The increases were most likely caused by ultrasound induced aggregation of the nanoparticles. For the 10:1 and 15:1 N:P ratios, no significant effects were seen on either particle size or surface potential (unpaired Student's t-test P b 0.05).\r\n The size of the nebulized aerosol has importance for lung deposition of DEAPA P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles. The general size range for adequate deposition in the human lung ranges from 1-5 \u00b5m [3] . For comparison, saline and 0.1% poloxamer aerosols were measured by laser diffraction to determine the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) from the Aeroneb Laboratory Nebulizer, which was claimed to produce aerosols in the 2.5-4.0 \u00b5m range [35] . The median size ranges were 4.5 \u00b1 0.1 and 5.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m, respectively. The addition of the nanoparticle suspension (diluted with Fig. 3 . Effects of nebulization on the P(68)-10\/siRNA (A) particle size and (B) zetapotential. saline) had little effect, as the MMAD was 4.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m. At this size range, a majority of the dosage would be available for therapeutic lung deposition.\r\n For efficient siRNA delivery into the cytosol the strength of electrostatic interaction between the siRNA and the transport vehicle is of major importance. Polymers with a high charge density such as PEI might form inseparable complexes with siRNA, impeding the release in the cytosol [36] . For high knockdown efficiency, siRNA formulations should be stable during cellular uptake but release siRNA in the cytosol, where it can bind to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and exert its biological activity [37] . To investigate the electrostatic interaction of the P(68)-10 and siRNA, a heparin competition assay was performed. PEI 25 kDa as a typical example for polyplexes and Lipofectamine for lipoplexes were included for comparison. In accordance with the low knockdown efficiency of PEI 25 kDa in H1299 luc cells, PEI displayed a strong electrostatic RNA binding. To release 30% of siRNA from PEI polyplexes, 0.5 IU heparin were required, and at least 1 IU heparin was necessary to release 70% of siRNA, as shown in Fig. 4 . By contrast, P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles formed sufficiently stable nano-carriers for nebulization and endocytotic uptake (see in vitro biological activity) but the electrostatic binding was not as high, allowing sufficient release of siRNA in buffer and possibly in the cytoplasm. Only 0.05 IU heparin were necessary to release 30% of siRNA from the nanoparticles, and 0.5 IU heparin to release 70% siRNA. The much smaller binding affinity of P(68)-10 polymer was due to the type and density of the amine present. The tertiary dimethyl amine incorporated into P(68)-10 will be less protonated than the PEI primary amines [38] and therefore have less electrostatic affinity with the phosphate groups of siRNA. In comparison to PEI, the amine density is also about 50 times less, with 2500 Da\/amine for P(68)-10 versus 43 Da\/amine for PEI. These two properties combined ensure that the siRNA is weakly bound within the P(68)-10 nanoparticle, and upon P(68)-10 degradation, the siRNA is able to free itself from the degradation by-products. In the case of Lipofectamine, no siRNA could be released from the lipoplexes with heparin. However, recent studies showed that lipoplexes decomplex more easily than polyplexes, which can be explained by their fusogenic properties with cell membranes leading to the release of the siRNA [39] .\r\n 3.6. Nanoparticle degradation and siRNA release at pH 7.4\r\n As mentioned above biodegradability is a key factor for long-term pulmonary application to avoid side-effects caused by accumulation [39] [40] [41] . The first breakthrough in pulmonary drug delivery was achieved with PLGA microparticles [42] , due to their low toxicity and biodegradable character. The drawback of the PLGA microparticles was their slow degradation rate, which could vary from weeks to months. Wittmar et al. therefore synthesized a new class of DEAPA-PVA-PLGA polymers with a much faster degradation rate, by introducing hydrophilic amine groups [24] . To study the degradation profile of P (68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles under physiological conditions, static light scattering was used. The degradation of the P(68)-10 nanoparticles particles was shown to be dependent on the pH. Solutions of 0. 1% poloxamer (pH 5.2, Fig. 2B ) and 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.5, data not shown) both displayed t 1\/2 of N1000 min. At physiological pH, degradation of the nanoparticles was complete in less than 300 min at pH 7.4 in phosphate buffered saline with a t 1\/2 of 76 min as seen in Fig. 5 . In accordance to the results obtained by static light scattering, siRNA release studies in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 showed a 40% release during the first 2 h. After 4 h incubation a nearly complete release is achieved with 80% free siRNA. This rapid rate of siRNA release, correlated to the degradation of the siRNA carrier, has not been demonstrated for other siRNA carriers to our knowledge. A similar behaviour was shown by Tseng et al. with the formulations of biodegradable poly(amino ester glycol urethane)\/siRNA polyplexes. They could show a maximum siRNA release after 14 h incubation in PBS pH 7.4 [12] . The rapid biodegradability does not only have a positive effect on biocompatibility but most likely contributes to a rapid release of the siRNA inside the cytosol after endocytotic escape. Whereas in the acidic endosome (pH 5.0-5.5), there would be little to no degradation, and the siRNA would remain protected and encapsulated. Exactly how the P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles escape from the lysosome remains to be investigated in more detail. While lipoplexes are known to escape from endosomes by a fusion mechanism with the cell membrane [43] , cationic polymers such as polyethylenimine (PEI) are thought to be released from endosomes by the so-called proton-sponge effect [44] and possibly local membrane damage [45] . Presently the escape mechanism of P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles is not known and remains to be determined in separate studies but we speculate that not only osmotic effects but also interactions with the endosomal membrane could play a role. This interaction would disrupt the membrane potential generated by membrane bound ATPases, and keep the pH near the extracellular and cytosol pH, where the degradation P(68)-10\/ siRNA is rapid and subsequent release of siRNA would find its way into the cytosol. Further studies are under way to clarify the mechanistic aspects of siRNA delivery using P(68) nanoparticles. 3.7. Cytotoxicity of P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles To evaluate the toxicity of the pure P(68)-10 nanoparticles and P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles, the MTT assay and the RBC hemolysis assay were performed. PEI 25 kDa served as a comparison in both cases. As illustrated in Fig. 6A cells treated with pure P(68)-10 nanoparticles and P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles show relatively high cell viability. In comparison to PEI 25 kDa (LD 50 = 4.1 \u00b5g\/ml), P(68)-10 nanoparticles display a 16-fold lower toxicity (LD 50 = 67.2 \u00b5g\/ml). Encapsulating siRNA into the nanoparticles further decreases cytotoxicity, with a LD 50 of 179.2 \u00b5g\/ml it shows a 3-fold difference from the unencapsulated nanoparticles. This effect is most likely due to the negative charges on the siRNA shielding or neutralizing some of the toxic P(68)-10 cationic charge.\r\n As erythrocytes are one of the most used cellular membrane models, the RBC hemolysis experiment served as a model assay to investigate membrane interactions of P(68)-10\/siRNA with cells [46] . As depicted in Fig. 6B 60% of the erythrocytes were hemolysed, when treated with 125 \u00b5g PEI 25 kDa. In contrast, incubation with 50 \u00b5l P(68)-10 nanoparticles without siRNA, equivalent to 125 \u00b5g DEAPA polymer, significantly reduced erythrocyte lysis and only led to 20% hemolysis. P(68)-10 nanoparticles with and without encapsulated siRNA were shown to be three times less hemolytic than PEI 25K, and the 6:1 P(68)-10\/ siRNA formulation displayed seven times less toxic membrane interaction.\r\n 3.8. In vitro biological activity of P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles The transfection efficiency of P(68)-10 nanoparticles was assessed in a human lung epithelial cell line, H1299 luc. This cell line was stably transfected to express firefly luciferase. Nanoparticle suspensions were formulated with anti-luc siRNA, which specifically targets firefly luciferase mRNA or a non-specific siRNA control that has at least four mismatches from any known human gene. Fig. 7 displays the results of seven different N:P ratios and three different siRNA doses. The more effective the siRNA carrier, the more luciferase mRNA cleavage and the less luciferase protein expressed. In contrast, using non-specific siRNA decrease in luciferase can only be observed if the P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles are affecting the cell metabolism or causing cytotoxicity. At the P(68)-10 nanoparticles\/siRNA (5 pmol or 65 ng siRNA, Fig. 7A ) formulation, the N:P ratios 10-20:1 displayed luciferase specific knockdown to levels of 15-20% compared to untreated H1299 luc cells, or control. Non-specific knockdown was low (N60% luciferase activity compared to control) and only seen in the largest N:P ratios. The 10 pmol nanoparticle suspensions achieved a higher level of antiluc siRNA knockdown that was~10% of control. The optimum N:P ratios (10 pmol or 130 ng siRNA, Fig. 7B ) dosage were from 8-12:1 and were comparable to Lipofectamine 2000, a commercial transfection reagent. At the highest siRNA dosage tested, 20 pmol (Fig. 7C) , anti-luc siRNA knockdown was the greatest with most of the values b5% of control. However, at 20 pmol siRNA, non-specific siRNA knockdown was seen in a dose dependent manner, which was most likely caused from P(68)-10\/siRNA induced cytotoxicity.\r\n Polyethylenimine (PEI) 25 kDa was used as a negative control. Known as a highly efficient standard transfection reagent for pDNA, it displayed less promising gene silencing in the case of siRNA. Strong electrostatic interactions with siRNA were shown using the Heparin Binding Assay and likely results in low knockdown efficiency due to incomplete siRNA release into the cytosol. The design of the P(68)-10\/ siRNA formulation allows for a more favourable release of siRNA, due to a number of factors. A highly positive surface charge of 15-20 mV ensures the binding of the nanoparticles to the negatively charged cell membrane, where uptake can take place. Once inside the endosomes, interaction of the positively charged hydrophobic nanoparticles with the endosomal membrane, in a similar way as it has been hypothesized for PEI [45] , would lead to destabilization and local membrane damages. Water influx followed by neutralization of the acidic lysosomal environment would cause hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation of the PLGA chains into its by-products. As a result the osmotic pressure increases, thereby leading to further water influx and ultimate rupture of the endosomes [47] . In the cytosol (pH 7.4) degradation of the P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles is fast and subsequent release of the siRNA can occur. Rapid uptake and endolysosomal release in less than 10 min is also seen with PLGA nanoparticles [48] . These factors most likely contribute to the high luciferase knockdown seen with the small siRNA dosages of 5 and 10 pmol.\r\n 3.9. Effects of nebulization on in vitro biological activity of P(68)-10\/ siRNA nanoparticles Nebulization of the P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles has been shown to effect the size and standard deviation of the nanoparticle suspension at low N:P ratios (see Fig. 3 ). This was also seen in the transfection of siRNA. Fig. 8 displays the results of two N:P ratios, 6:1 and 10:1, that were tested for effects after nebulization and condensation. For the non-specific siRNA, no effects are seen for either N:P ratio or siRNA dosage. From this data, it can be concluded that nebulization had no effect on the cytotoxicity properties of the nanoparticle suspensions. For the 6:1 N:P ratio, nebulization caused a significant decrease in both the 5 and 10 pmol siRNA dosages (unpaired Student's t-test). On average, there was a 20% increase in luciferase knockdown activity after nebulization for the 6:1 N:P ratio. A cause for the decreased siRNA transfection observed after nebulization for the 6:1 N:P ratio might be linked by the results seen for the particle sizes. After nebulization the mean particle size increased from 157 nm to 215 nm. The increase in size of the nanoparticle suspension should not make much difference, as the 15:1 N:P ratio has a similar particle size of 200-210 nm and transfection results were not affected after nebulization (data not shown). Instead, the vibrating energy of the nebulizer may have a more disruptive behaviour for the smaller 6:1 N:P, due to the smaller particle sizes, the increased proportion of siRNA it is carrying, or both. This disruptive effect possibly leads to less siRNA encapsulated or nanoparticles that degrades faster than observed, and therefore less siRNA delivered to the H1299 luc cells.\r\n For the higher N:P ratio of 10:1, the nebulization had no effect on the siRNA knockdown of luciferase. Both formulations, before and after nebulization, had luciferase knockdown of N90%. This data, in consideration with aerosol droplet sizes of 4.5 \u03bcm, demonstrates the potential of P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles with ratios of 10:1 or higher to act as siRNA carriers for potential pulmonary delivery.\r\n The design and formulation of siRNA carriers for gene therapy in the last few years have led to a broad panel of various liposomal and cationic polymer vectors. Liposome-mediated delivery showed efficient knockdown in vitro but were inefficient when applied in vivo via instillation [7] . Among the polymeric vectors, derivatives of PEI such as degradable oligo-ethylenimine, pegylated PEI and low molecular weight fraction of PEI have been used as siRNA carriers [8, 49, 50] . These siRNA carriers and others have slowly elucidated what is necessary for an ideal carrier. An ideal siRNA carrier for aerosol gene therapy needs to meet the following requirements: i) protection of the siRNA against high shear forces during nanoparticle formation and nebulization ii) fast degradation rate into non-toxic by-products at the target site iii) release of siRNA into the cytosol for effective gene silencing. The design of the branched polyester, consisting of an amine-modified PVA backbone grafted with PLGA chains, was tested to see if this polymer could meet the requirements needed for use as a siRNA carrier. SiRNA was shown to be encapsulated or absorbed with greater than 90% efficiency into the nanoparticles. The encapsulated siRNA was protected and remained intact during nanoparticle formation and after nebulization. Particle size and transfection results both demonstrate that the anti-luc siRNA remained active against luciferase as long as N:P ratios of at or above 10:1 were formulated. Breakdown of the nanoparticles within 4 h, shown by static light scattering, leads to a rapid release of the siRNA. Though this could be challenging for in vivo gene delivery as most physiological fluids are also within this rapid degradation pH range, the high surface potential of the P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles makes it likely that it will be taken into the lung cells quickly upon aerosol deposition. Nebulization of the nanoparticle suspension had only minor effects on the in vitro biological activity at the lowest N:P ratio of 6:1. This issue could be easily overcome with an increase in the N:P ratio. At an N:P ratio of 10:1 the nebulized P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles displayed comparable knockdown efficiency to the non-nebulized samples. Only small siRNA dosages of 5 and 10 pmol were necessary to achieve a luciferase knockdown of 80-90% with minor to no cytotoxicity. The combined features of fast degradation combined with low cytotoxicity, nanoparticle stability during nebulization, and high specific knockdown make the P(68)-10 polymer a promising siRNA carrier for pulmonary gene therapy and future in vivo studies.","sha":"2b3a3e3956afd65a8fa11d3867da3e58f8915514","publish_time":"2008-12-18","authors":"Nguyen, Juliane; Steele, Terry W.J.; Merkel, Olivia; Reul, Regina; Kissel, Thomas","journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","doi":"10.1016\/j.jconrel.2008.06.010","Title":"Journal of Controlled Release","H index":237.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) offers new opportunities for the treatment of lung diseases such as lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Once across these barriers, a number of additional factors have to be taken into consideration. SiRNA is quickly inactivated by RNases and macrophages. Liposomal formulations have been shown to be poor siRNA carriers for pulmonary gene delivery [7] , possibly due to the surfactants inherent in the lung [9, 10] . Combined with a fast siRNA release, these siRNA polyplexes lead to efficient gene silencing in vitro [12] . Recent studies reported chitosan as a potential carrier for siRNA delivery, however none of them investigated the degradation in correlation with siRNA release and knockdown efficiency [13] [14] [15] . Poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles were most frequently used for encapsulation of peptides, proteins and pDNA. This polymer was found to be useful for pDNA containing nanoparticles [20] showing surprisingly high transfection efficiencies. The anti-luciferase siRNA: 5\u2032-GAUUAUGUCCGGUUAUGUA-3\u2032 (cat. D-002050-01-20) and siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA #3 (cat. Nanoparticles were prepared using a solvent displacement method, described by Jung et al. [ Briefly, 5 mg of P(68)-10 were dissolved in 500 \u00b5l of dry acetone with stirring for 48 h. In a sterile laminar flow hood, 20 \u00b5l siRNA (0.25 \u00b5g\/\u00b5l) was dispersed into a 100 \u00b5l P(68)-10 acetone solution. The supernatant was analyzed for siRNA concentration by an ethidium bromide intercalation assay after 15 min incubation with 50 IU of heparin. Fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (LS 50 B, Perkin Elmer, Rodgau-J\u00fcgesheim, Germany) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 518 nm and 605 nm, respectively. The prepared nanoparticle suspension (200 \u00b5l) was pipetted directly onto the membrane of a sterilized Aeroneb Laboratory Nebulizer. Typical recoveries of the aerosol were N70%. Experiments were carried out in quadruplicate. Droplet sizes are expressed as mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD). Measurement of particle size and zeta-potential Hydrodynamic diameter of nanoparticle suspensions was measured by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) using the Zetasizer, Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments (Herrenberg, Germany). Nanoparticles were prepared in a total volume of 200 \u00b5l at different N\/P ratios containing 200 pmol of siRNA. All measurements are given as mean values of three independent runs and performed in triplicate. To study the nanoparticle stability against anions a heparin competition assay was performed. After incubation for 15 min at RT all solutions were filled to a final volume of 180 \u00b5l and mixed with 20 \u00b5l of a 0.0125 mg\/ml ethidium bromide solution. Free siRNA was calculated by a calibration curve ranging from 0.0156 \u00b5g-0.75 \u00b5g siRNA. Results are given as means of triplicate measurements. Nanoparticle suspensions (100 \u00b5l, 10:1 N:P ratio, containing Anti-Luc siRNA) were diluted 1:5 with phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 in a low volume Eppendorf UVette. The pellet was separated from the supernatant and incubated with 50 IU. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) was used as a positive control for siRNA delivery and was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were lysed in 100 \u00b5l cell culture lysis buffer for 15 min. Twenty-four hours before transfection, H1299 luc cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 0.6 \u00d7 10 4 per well. Absorbance was measured at 560 nm and background at 670 nm was subtracted. Cell viability = nanoparticle concentration absorbance \/ blank cell absorbance \u00d7 100. Red blood cells were washed in PBS until the supernatant was clear. Nanoparticle suspensions were prepared as explained in 'Preparation of nanoparticle suspension'. Significance between the mean values was calculated using unpaired Student's t-tests. Probability values P b 0.05 were marked with \u204e, P b 0.01 were marked with \u204e\u204e and P b 0.001 were marked with \u204e\u204e\u204e.\r\n The P(68)-10 polymer was prepared and characterized as described by Wittmar et al. [ Investigation on efficiency of nanoparticle formation and siRNA encapsulation showed that for the P(68)-10 polymer at a 10:1 N:P (nitrogen to phosphate) ratio, 98 \u00b1 2% formed nanoparticles that could be filtered by the 0.02 \u00b5m filter. Physico-chemical properties P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles Nanoparticle formulations were prepared by varying the ratio between the amine functions on the polymer backbone and the phosphate groups in siRNA, abbreviated as N:P ratio. A slight increase in the scattering intensity was seen, but most likely resulted from solvent evaporation. This device uses an ultrasonic vibrating mesh to nebulize aqueous medium. The median size ranges were 4.5 \u00b1 0.1 and 5.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m, respectively. At this size range, a majority of the dosage would be available for therapeutic lung deposition. In accordance with the low knockdown efficiency of PEI 25 kDa in H1299 luc cells, PEI displayed a strong electrostatic RNA binding. By contrast, P(68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles formed sufficiently stable nano-carriers for nebulization and endocytotic uptake (see in vitro biological activity) but the electrostatic binding was not as high, allowing sufficient release of siRNA in buffer and possibly in the cytoplasm. Only 0.05 IU heparin were necessary to release 30% of siRNA from the nanoparticles, and 0.5 IU heparin to release 70% siRNA. However, recent studies showed that lipoplexes decomplex more easily than polyplexes, which can be explained by their fusogenic properties with cell membranes leading to the release of the siRNA [39] . The first breakthrough in pulmonary drug delivery was achieved with PLGA microparticles [42] , due to their low toxicity and biodegradable character. To study the degradation profile of P (68)-10\/siRNA nanoparticles under physiological conditions, static light scattering was used. This rapid rate of siRNA release, correlated to the degradation of the siRNA carrier, has not been demonstrated for other siRNA carriers to our knowledge.

In contrast, incubation with 50 \u00b5l P(68)-10 nanoparticles without siRNA, equivalent to 125 \u00b5g DEAPA polymer, significantly reduced erythrocyte lysis and only led to 20% hemolysis. P(68)-10 nanoparticles with and without encapsulated siRNA were shown to be three times less hemolytic than PEI 25K, and the 6:1 P(68)-10\/ siRNA formulation displayed seven times less toxic membrane interaction. This cell line was stably transfected to express firefly luciferase. Nanoparticle suspensions were formulated with anti-luc siRNA, which specifically targets firefly luciferase mRNA or a non-specific siRNA control that has at least four mismatches from any known human gene. 7 displays the results of seven different N:P ratios and three different siRNA doses.

These factors most likely contribute to the high luciferase knockdown seen with the small siRNA dosages of 5 and 10 pmol.

An important characteristic of mucosal vaccination is its ability to elicit local immune responses, which act against infection at the site of pathogen entry. However, mucosal surfaces are endowed with potent and sophisticated tolerance mechanisms to prevent the immune system from overreacting to the many environmental antigens. Hence, mucosal vaccination may suppress the immune system instead of induce a protective immune response. Therefore, mucosal adjuvants and\/or special antigen delivery systems as well as appropriate dosage forms are required in order to develop potent mucosal vaccines. Whereas oral, nasal and pulmonary vaccine delivery strategies have been described extensively, the sublingual and buccal routes have received considerably less attention. In this review, the characteristics of and approaches for sublingual and buccal vaccine delivery are described and compared with other mucosal vaccine delivery sites. We discuss recent progress and highlight promising developments in the search for vaccine formulations, including adjuvants and suitable dosage forms, which are likely critical for designing a successful sublingual or buccal vaccine. Finally, we outline the challenges, hurdles to overcome and formulation issues relevant for sublingual or buccal vaccine delivery.","text_body":"Among public health interventions, vaccination is by far the most effective strategy in maintaining population health and combating infectious diseases, especially in developing countries and disaster areas. Vaccination saves millions of lives every year, while bringing numerous social and economic benefits [1] . Since the vast majority of pathogens infect their host through the mucosa, an ideal vaccine should induce protective immunity at mucosal sites in order to act as a first line of defense against infections. However, most of the vaccines currently in use are administered via injection, e.g., via the subcutaneous or intramuscular route. This generally induces poor mucosal immunity, whereas vaccines administered via mucosal routes have proven to be effective for the induction of both systemic and local immunity [2] . Additionally, mucosal immunization makes vaccine delivery easier and safer than parenteral administration routes, is very suitable for mass immunization during pandemic situations, and improves acceptability especially among children [3, 4] .\r\n Despite the advantages mentioned above, there are currently only few mucosal vaccines for human use on the market [5] . The reason for this is that mucosal vaccination poses several challenges, such as immune regulation and tolerance, as well as overcoming fast removal of the vaccine by body fluids and enzymes, as has been reviewed for the oral [3, 6] , the nasal [7] and the pulmonary route [8] . Compared to the above-mentioned traditional mucosal routes, sublingual and buccal vaccine administration has received less attention. For many years, these routes have been used for the delivery of low-molecular-weight drugs to the bloodstream. Currently, the only vaccines that are widely being used for delivery via the oral mucosae are therapeutic sublingual allergy vaccines. These vaccines are used for sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) to treat allergic hypersensitivity. Sublingual delivery of allergens can activate regulatory T cells that can suppress undesired immune reactions [9] . This has resulted in several approved sublingual products for allergy immunotherapy, such as SLITone\u00ae, Sublivac\u00ae, Grazax\u00ae, Oralair\u00ae, and AllerSlit\u00aeforte. Allergy vaccines are reviewed by Valenta et al. [10] and are beyond the scope of this review since they are aimed at immune regulation (tolerance) instead of activation of the adaptive immune system.\r\n In this review, we will describe the potential and limitations of the sublingual and buccal mucosae as vaccine delivery sites and the mucosal immune responses that are induced upon sublingual or buccal vaccination. Further, the current status of sublingual and buccal vaccine delivery will be discussed and suitable vaccine antigens and potent adjuvants (immune potentiators and\/or delivery systems) will be highlighted. Appropriate dosage forms that are required for a successful sublingual or buccal vaccine will also be outlined. Finally, the forthcoming perspectives are given, including the existing research and development gaps in this field and the potential of improved or controlled release vaccine formulations for sublingual and buccal vaccine delivery.\r\n Mucosal vaccine delivery in the mouth can be subdivided into sublingual and buccal delivery. Sublingual delivery occurs via the mucosa of the ventral surface of the tongue and the floor of the mouth under the tongue, whereas buccal delivery occurs via the buccal mucosa, which is located in the cheeks, the gums and the upper and lower inner lips (Fig. 1) . The specific structure and cell composition of the sublingual and buccal regions in the mouth define whether they are more or less suitable for vaccine delivery (as described below).\r\n Within the oral cavity, some mucosal regions are lined by a keratinized stratified epithelium (gingival, hard palate, outer lips), whereas other regions are lined by a non-keratinized stratified epithelium (Fig. 1) . The epithelium is supported by a basement membrane, which separates the two major layers of the oral mucosa: the epithelium and the underlying connective tissue or lamina propria. The arrangement of the hard palate and gingival, including the pluristratified keratinized mucosal epithelium and the lamina propria that is anchored onto the periostium of the underlying bone, makes these regions chemically and mechanically resistant to withstand the shearing forces associated with chewing food. The floor of the mouth, the inner surface of the lips and cheeks, and the ventral side of the tongue are covered by a non-keratinized epithelium, rendering these relatively more elastic and pervious than keratinized mucosae, and thus potentially more suitable for drug or antigen delivery.\r\n The epithelium serves as a mechanical barrier protecting the underlying tissues and consists of a basal layer, an intermediate layer, and a superficial layer. From the basal to superficial layer the cells become larger, more flattened, more proteinaceous in the form of protein monofilaments, and less viable due to the absence of organelles (Fig. 2) . The compacted, flattened cells of the lower superficial and intermediate layers form the major physical barrier to transport, whereas the intercellular lipids play an important role in the permeability of the mucosa. Besides the epithelial cells, the oral mucosal epithelium also contains three other cell types. The basal layer includes Merkel cells, which are endocrine cells associated with nerve fibers that contribute to the overall barrier function of the epithelium. They have also been suggested to play a role in the regenerative processes of oral mucosa [11] . Further, the suprabasal layer contains two types of cells: melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin and are thus responsible for the color of the mucosa; and Langerhans cells (LCs), which are the most superficial antigen-presenting cells and an important target for the induction of an immune response. Other antigen-presenting cells below the mucosa are the myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) located along the lamina propria and the plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) found in the submucosal tissue (Fig. 2) .\r\n Salivary glands, which are located just below the mucosa in the mouth, produce mucin, a major component of the mucus layer on the mucosal surface, and help to promote the production and secretion of saliva. Saliva is needed to moisten and lubricate the mucosae and assists the masticatory process by binding the food bolus prior to and during swallowing. Additionally, salivary secretions protect the oral epithelium from potential harmful substances and regulate the composition of the oral microbial flora by its enzyme activity and by maintaining the oral pH between 5.5 and 7.0 [12] .\r\n Sublingual and buccal mucosae are attractive vaccine delivery sites that may have advantages over other routes, because of their anatomy and physiology. Table 1 shows an overview of characteristics of different sites that have been investigated for vaccine delivery. The dermal delivery site has been included because it contains comparable features with the buccal and sublingual sites, such as the presence of LCs as a main target for the vaccine antigen. However, dermal vaccination has the disadvantage that the impermeable thick keratinized stratum corneum acts as a physiological barrier for the diffusion of antigens to reach LCs after topical administration. As a result, dermal vaccination in general needs chemical disruption and\/or microneedle penetration of this wall in order to let antigens reach the LCs to induce an immune response [13] . In contrast, sublingual and buccal mucosae suitable for vaccine delivery lack keratinized epithelium.\r\n Compared to gastro-intestinal mucosal routes, degradation by gastric fluids and gastrointestinal enzymes is avoided during sublingual or buccal delivery, although some enzymatic activity is present in the mouth.\r\n Most of the mucosal routes have special 'gateways', the so-called microfold (M) cells that are present in the epithelium covering the follicles of mucosal tissues. These M cells take care of the transport of antigens to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT). The Peyer's patches (PP), nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) are important inductive 2 . Antigen delivery and antigen presentation following sublingual or buccal vaccination. Upon vaccine delivery, the antigen is likely to be captured by Langerhans cells (LC) within the mucosa itself and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) along the lamina propria. Antigen-bearing DCs will migrate to draining lymph nodes where they interact with na\u00efve CD4 and CD8 T cells to support the differentiation into effector T cells (i.e., helper (Th) and cytotoxic T cells (CTL)) and thereby induction of the adaptive immune response. Compared to other routes, the sublingual and buccal routes have the potential to induce mucosal immune responses in a broad range of tissues (Table 1 ) as described in more detail in Section 2.2 ('Mucosal immune responses'). Nagai et al. (2014) recently reported the transport of sublingual antigens across sublingual ductal epithelial cells to ductal APCs in mice [14] . Since different studies failed to detect specific sampling cells (or M-like structures) in the sublingual or buccal mucosa [14, 15] , it seems most likely that antigens cross the ductal epithelium via paracellular and transcellular pathways [14] . So, probably the efficiency of vaccine delivery via these routes is directly related to the permeability of the mucosal membrane. This permeability is influenced by the thickness and the degree of keratinization of these membranes. The thickness of the human buccal mucosa has been estimated to be in the range of 500-800 \u03bcm, whereas the mucosal thickness of the sublingual region is about 100-200 \u03bcm [16] . In terms of permeability, the sublingual region is more permeable than the buccal region, which in turn is more permeable than the palatal region ( Fig. 1) . Sublingual administration can provide a rapid uptake of macromolecules and thus appears to be an attractive route for dosage forms with a short delivery period.\r\n In the development of sublingual or buccal vaccines, the presence of saliva should be taken into account. Although saliva may be useful for the release of the antigen from certain dosage forms, it can be disadvantageous since the salivary composition, pH, and flow rate are variable. Excessive secretion and salivary flow may dilute the antigen or lead to swallowing of the dosage form before the antigen is absorbed through the mucosa, the so-called 'saliva washout' [12] . Moreover, the presence of digestive enzymes could lead to degradation of the antigen.\r\n Since pH is a critical parameter for antigen absorption, the pH values at the different oral mucosal sites should be kept in mind for successful vaccine delivery. For example in adults, the pH of the floor of the mouth is about 6.5, whereas that of the buccal region is about 6.3 [17] . However, factors, such as diet and saliva flow rate, may affect the pH of the oral mucosa.\r\n In Section 4 ('Dosage forms'), we describe different ways to circumvent the challenging characteristics of sublingual or buccal vaccine delivery.\r\n Unlike small synthetic drugs, vaccine antigens do not reach the bloodstream after entering the sublingual or buccal mucosa, but are rather captured by antigen-presenting DCs, mainly LCs, in the mucosa. The antigen uptake, process and the presentation of their epitopes to T cells by antigen-presenting cells are required to induce effective adaptive immunity. For example, the ovalbumin antigen crosses the epithelial barrier within 15 to 30 min and the uptake by sublingual DCs occurs within 30 to 60 min after sublingual administration in mice [18] . Rare pro-inflammatory cells, i.e., histamine-containing mast cells (MC) or eosinophils (Eos) (Fig. 2) , are found in oral tissues, and these cells are mainly spread in the muscular layer beneath the mucosa [18, 19] . Therefore, it is likely that most of the antigen is mainly captured by LCs and other oral DCs in the upper layers prior to reaching proinflammatory cells. The relatively high frequency of LCs and low numbers of mast cells in the buccal region [19] make the buccal mucosa an attractive site for vaccine delivery despite its thicker epithelium and lower permeability as compared to the sublingual mucosa.\r\n Antigen-bearing DCs migrate to the lymph nodes draining the sublingual and buccal area where they are able to prime both na\u00efve CD4 and CD8 T cells (Fig. 2 , T 0 cells). For example, Eriksson et al. reported that a substantial number of DCs leave the buccal epithelium after topical buccal immunization and migrate to draining lymph nodes where they present processed antigen to CD4 T lymphocytes [20] . Another study revealed the buccal epithelium as inductive site of efficient priming of CD8 T lymphocytes [21] . Upon activation, T and B cells that leave the site of the initial antigen presentation, enter the circulation and then disperse to selected mucosal sites, where they differentiate into memory or effector cells. The activation of CD4 T lymphocytes leads to the induction of antigen-specific helper T (Th cells) and\/or regulatory T cell (Treg) mediated immune responses (Fig. 2) , whereas CD8 T cells facilitate the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses (Fig. 2) . The tissue destination of these cells appears to be largely determined by site-specific integrins, supposed 'homing receptors', on their surface that will bind to mucosal tissue-specific receptors (addressins) on vascular endothelial cells [22] . Recent work of Hervouet et al. demonstrates that antigen-bearing DCs that have captured the antigen in the sublingual mucosa are encountered in distant lymph nodes and spleen following sublingual immunization of mice [23] , which suggests that sublingual DCs are capable to enter the blood circulation to seed distant lymphoid organs.\r\n The migration of immune cells from the inductive MALT to distant effector tissues is the cellular basis for the so-called 'common mucosal immune system'. The MALT contains T-cell zones, B-cell enriched areas containing a high frequency of sIgA-positive B cells and a subepithelial area with antigen-presenting cells to induce specific immune responses. As mentioned earlier, the oral mucosa lacks a certain immunological structure as observed in Peyer's patches of the intestine where the antigen is sampled by specialized M cells. However, different studies describe the concept of oral lymphoid foci, the equivalent of the germinal centers observed in other MALT, suggesting that the oral mucosa serves as a site for immune induction. The role of oral DCs in deciding whether to induce adaptive immunity or tolerance, and whether there exist germinal centers in oral lymphoid foci are discussed extensively by others [24, 25] . The distribution of immune cells, particularly the abundant presence of oral LCs, makes the oral mucosa an attractive site for vaccine delivery. Both sublingual and buccal immunization are able to promote mucosal immunity, as well as systemic immunity, against pathogens entering the human body at more distant sites than the mouth (mucosa), such as the respiratory tract or reproductive tract (Table 1) .\r\n In the section below, we will describe the use of live (attenuated) pathogens, recombinant (heterologous expression) and inactivated vaccines. Furthermore, we will outline adjuvants, i.e., immune potentiators and\/or delivery systems, that have been evaluated for vaccination via the sublingual or buccal route. A summary of the published studies on sublingual and buccal vaccination is given in Table 2 .\r\n Sublingual immunization of mice with live attenuated influenza virus (A\/PR\/8 strain, H1N1) has been found to be safe and effective for inducing protective immune responses in mucosal and systemic compartments. Song et al. concluded that the observed protection was mediated by the induction of influenza virus-specific IgG in the serum and secretory IgA (sIgA) in the respiratory mucosa, which limit virus entry and replication in the respiratory tract. A single sublingual dose of A\/PR\/8 virus prevented lung pathology induced by influenza virus challenge and provided a broad-range cross-protection against different influenza virus subtypes. Thereby, the risk of potential passage of vaccine virus to the olfactory bulb was avoided by using the sublingual route since no viral RNA was detected in brains of sublingually vaccinated mice, in contrast to mice that received the same vaccine intranasally [26] . Similarly, sublingual administration of live-attenuated virus lacking the non-structural protein 1 (DeltaNS1) was as protective against influenza virus challenges in mice as intranasal immunization. Sublingual immunization with these DeltaNS1 viruses induced high levels of virus-specific antibodies and stimulated immune cells in mucosaassociated and systemic lymphoid organs [27] . Moreover, the vaccine was well tolerated and did not induce bodyweight loss in sublingually vaccinated mice.\r\n Replication-defective adenovirus vectors (rAdV) have been widely explored for the delivery of antigens. Infection by adenoviruses occurs through the airway epithelium and replication takes place in mucosal tissues of the respiratory tract. These characteristics make these vectors suitable for mucosal vaccine delivery. Sublingual immunization with rAdV encoding the conserved influenza nucleoprotein antigen [28] or the soluble globular head of hemagglutinin [29] protected mice against influenza virus infection. Furthermore, sublingual administration of rAd5 vectors encoding HIV proteins induced both significant antigen-specific humoral (serum and mucosal IgG and IgA) [30] and cellular (systemic and mucosal CTL responses) [31] immune responses. Moreover, sublingual vaccination with rAdV encoding a truncated S protein (rAdV-S), which is a major antigenic protein present on severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), induced systemic neutralizing antibodies and airway IgA antibody responses in mice. These immune responses were similar to those induced by intranasal administration. It is worth noting that intranasal delivery of rAdV redirected the virus vector to the olfactory bulb, whereas no adenoviral DNA was detected after sublingual delivery [32] . Choi et al. reported that both mice and guinea pigs were protected against a lethal Ebola challenge after a single sublingual immunization with an AdV-based vaccine expressing the Zaire glycoprotein in a manner similar to that of traditional intramuscular vaccination [33] .\r\n With the availability of genetic tools for heterologous gene expression, the concept of live vaccine vehicles has sparked renewed interest, especially for the mucosal routes [34] . Several studies have shown that engineered Bacillus (B) subtilis is able to generate systemic and mucosal antibodies against heterologous antigens. B. subtilis delivered sublingually and expressing tetanus toxin C-fragment, evoked protective immunity in both mice [35] and piglets [36] . Batista et al. reported the use of 'gut-colonizing' B. subtilis spores as a new mucosal vaccine delivery platform consisting of two antigen expression strategies. One is active during spore formation, which leads to the display of recombinant adhesins at the spore surface that facilitates adhesion to mucosal surfaces. In addition, the recombinant spores have been shown to germinate after oral delivery resulting in intracellular expression of the antigen. Mice immunized with three doses of B. subtilis spores via the sublingual route, developed higher specific serum IgG titers when compared with the mice orally immunized with a ninefold higher dose of spores of the same strains. Although not proven in this study, the authors speculated that sublingual delivery of these spores will also result in intracellular antigen expression once they are captured by intraepithelial antigen-presenting cells and germinate [37] . The better immune response to sublingual vaccination might be ascribed to the fact that sublingual delivery has a smaller distribution volume and a less aggressive environment than gastro-intestinal delivery.\r\n In a study by Cho et al., different routes, i.e., intranasal, intravaginal, transdermal, sublingual and intramuscular, were compared in a mouse study using human papillomavirus 16L1 (HPV16L1) protein vaccine. Among these routes, the intranasal and sublingual routes provided the highest HPV16L1-specific levels of vaginal sIgA and systemic IgG responses that were comparable to those elicited via the intramuscular route [45] . Sublingual vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with a purified G protein fragment (Gcf) without the addition of adjuvants induced strong serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses (similar to intranasal vaccination) in mice. Interestingly, these antibody responses could be elicited by Gcf without the need for an adjuvant. The study demonstrated that the chemotactic activity exhibited by Gcf was necessary to induce protective immunity. Therefore, the authors proposed that Gcf has a self-adjuvanting property [46] .\r\n Murugappan et al. investigated whether sublingual administration of whole \u03b2-propiolactone (BPL)-inactivated influenza virus can prime the immune system for a later intramuscular boost with a heterologous vaccine. Although sublingual priming did not induce any detectable immune responses, it strongly enhanced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers against both the homologous as well as the heterologous vaccine after the intramuscular booster. In addition, sublingual priming induced IgA responses in the lung and nose, while intramuscular priming showed higher IgA responses in the lung, but not in the nose [40] . In a study by Song et al., a sublingual booster was given, instead of an intramuscular booster, and immune responses were analyzed more extensively. Immunization with formalin-inactivated influenza virus via the sublingual mucosa induced protective immune responses, elevated mucosal sIgA antibody levels, and enhanced virus-specific CTL responses [26] . The different procedures used for virus inactivation affect the membrane fusion properties of the virus to a certain extent, resulting in a less optimal activation of CTLs. Inactivation with formalin severely compromises fusion activity of the virus, while BPL-inactivation reveals preservation of the fusion activity [60] . However, a sublingual booster vaccination with formalin-inactivated influenza induced significant elevated virus-specific CTL responses in mice. Unfortunately, the analysis of CTL activation is lacking in the study using BPL-inactivated influenza.\r\n As with mucosal immunization in general, sublingual (and buccal) vaccination with non-replicative antigens does not induce sIgA and serum IgG responses without the addition of adjuvants. Strong immune potentiators or delivery systems are needed to break mucosal tolerance and facilitate uptake through the oral mucosae. For example, a mucosal adjuvant (cholera toxin, CT) was needed to induce immune responses upon sublingual immunization with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) subunit vaccine [48] . \u00c7uburu et al. evaluated the sublingual route for vaccine delivery using ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen. The mice received three doses of 200 \u03bcg OVA and although systemic IgG responses were measurable, mucosal OVA-specific antibody responses were absent after sublingual immunization of OVA alone. Coadministration of a mucosal adjuvant (CT) generated high OVA-specific IgA responses in saliva and nasal wash. These responses were of the same magnitude as those induced by intranasal administration [58] .\r\n Recently, sublingual administration of a subunit influenza vaccine was evaluated in mice. After three doses, detectable, but rather low, antigenspecific systemic IgG and HI titers were found after sublingual immunization, whereas mucosal IgA antibodies were below the detection limit. The addition of the mucosal adjuvant LTK63 was needed to those obtained after conventional intramuscular immunization [41] . A Salmonella vaccine consisting of sonicated Salmonella proteins induced protection only after sublingual immunization in the presence of adjuvants (CpG DNA or CT). This was observed in both adult [51] and neonatal mice [50] .\r\n Although mucosal adjuvants improve immune responses upon sublingual immunization using non-replicating\/inactivated antigens, in some studies systemic and\/or mucosal immunity was obtained with sublingual delivery of non-adjuvanted inactivated (subunit) vaccines [45, 46, 58] . In general, high doses were used and even the size of the antigen seemed to be an issue for successful immunization since small proteins\/antigens showed the induction of both systemic and mucosal immune responses upon sublingual administration. (continued on next page) The adjuvant effect of sublingually administered CT has been documented with a number of antigens, including influenza [43] and HIV [48] subunit vaccines, Salmonella proteins [50, 51] and Helicobacter pylori lysates [54, 55] with the latter two as undefined vaccines. LT, when co-administered sublingually with tetanus toxoid (TT) induced higher specific IgG and mucosal IgA antibody titers when compared to TT alone [57] . However, CT and LT cause severe diarrhea in humans and are involved in the clinical occurrences of cholera and enterotoxigenic E. coli enteritis, and therefore not suitable as an oral or sublingual adjuvant for human use [61] [62] [63] . Since enterotoxicity is mainly caused by the enzymatically active A-subunit, mutated enterotoxins with reduced toxicity but retained adjuvant properties, have been developed. LT(R192G), also named mLT, showed reduced toxicity in mice, but maintained its adjuvanticity to a level nearly equivalent to that of LT [64, 65] . Building on this mutant, a double mutant of LT, R192G\/L211A or dmLT, showed adjuvanticity for a co-administered antigen equivalent to mLT upon oral administration (gastro-intestinal delivery) [66] . Recently, dmLT has been evaluated as an adjuvant for sublingual and buccal vaccination with a whole-cell pneumococcal vaccine that induces protection in mice [52] . In the search for an alternative adjuvant for a H. pylori lysate vaccine, dmLT was compared to CT. Earlier studies have shown that a strong mucosal adjuvant like CT was needed to induce protective immune responses against H. pylori infection. Sublingual immunization with H. pylori lysate and dmLT significantly decreased the bacterial burden after H. pylori infection compared to unimmunized mice and to the same extent as when using CT as adjuvant [55] . Moreover, cellular immune responses that are known to correlate with protection were also fully comparable when using dmLT and CT as adjuvants.\r\n In a study by Cho et al., HPV16L1 protein provided both vaginal and salivary sIgA, and serum IgG responses after sublingual administration in mice (150 \u03bcg) [45] . Several adjuvants were tested, including the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB), three toll-like receptor agonists (i.e., Poly(I:C), MPL, imiquimod), three nucleotide-binding oligomerizationdomain agonists (L18-MDP, murabutide, PGN), vitamin D3 and polygamma-glutamic acid. Among the adjuvants tested, only CTB provided improved mucosal sIgA and systemic IgG induction. Sublingually applied CTB also enhanced the production of IL-4 and IFN-y by stimulated CD4 + T cells from the spleen, as well as the number of IFN-y producing CD8 + T cells that were isolated from the spleen or submandibular lymph node (SMLN). The other adjuvants had no effect on the immune response when compared to the unadjuvanted control [45] .\r\n Despite the negative results mentioned above, TLR agonists can significantly improve immune responses after sublingual vaccination. A mouse study evaluating TLR agonists (i.e., FSL-1, Poly(I:C), monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), Pam3CSK4, R848, cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG)) in different mucosal routes using HIV gp140 and a tetanus toxoid revealed clear differences in immunogenicity [49] . MPLA, a TLR-4 agonist, suppressed systemic responses when administered sublingually, while the responses were enhanced after intranasal or subcutaneous immunization. CpG, a TLR-9 ligand, evoked enhanced immune responses upon sublingual and intranasal immunization whereas it did not affect the responses after subcutaneous immunization [49] . Another study revealed that sublingual immunization with an Ad5 vector expressing a TLR agonist derived from Eimeriatenella significantly activated NK cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, B cells, and CD4 + T cells in the spleen. In addition, the number of cells expressing MHC-II increased [30] .\r\n Bacterial DNA or synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) containing CpG motifs act as mucosal adjuvants. These TLR 9 ligands induced strong Th1 responses in mice after sublingual delivery of a Salmonella vaccine [67] .\r\n Virus-like particles (VLPs) and virosomes have been evaluated for sublingual delivery. Cho et al. showed that sublingual delivery of HPV16L1 VLPs in mice induced systemic IgG and mucosal sIgA responses that were similar to the intranasal route, but significantly higher compared to other delivery (intravaginal, transdermal, intramuscular) routes [45] . In contrast to this study in mice, a clinical trial by Huo et al. with Gardasil\u00ae (Sanofi Pasteur), which contains the same L1-based VLPs from HPV but is co-administered with aluminum hydroxyphosphate as an adjuvant, showed that sublingual immunization is much less effective than intramuscular immunization [68] . However, this alum adjuvanted VLP formulation is not suitable for sublingual HPV vaccination, which is likely due to the fact that alum adjuvants consist of relatively large (micrometer range) particles that are probably poorly taken up by mucosal epithelial cells. Other adjuvants as well as improved dosage forms (see Section 4) may help to increase the immune response to the VLPs.\r\n A sublingual vaccine containing influenza H5N1 virosomes (2 \u03bcg HA) in combination with the mucosal adjuvant (3\u2032,5\u2032)-cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP) effectively induced local and systemic H5N1-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. The systemic IgG and nasal sIgA antibody levels were lower than those induced by intranasal administration, but the IgG levels were comparable to those obtained after intramuscular administration, whereas nasal sIgA levels were higher than the levels upon intramuscular administration [42] .\r\n Optimized dosage forms may improve the performance of sublingual and buccal vaccines substantially. Several dosage forms exist for sublingual and buccal delivery of marketed drugs. These range from droplets, sprays, and orally disintegrating tablets to oral films. However, only a few dosage forms have been used to explore sublingual or buccal delivery of vaccines. Almost all sublingual vaccination studies reported here have been performed by the simple application of droplets of a vaccine under the tongue. There are no studies on the role of potentially crucial variables, like contact time, vaccine viscosity and antigen release kinetics on immunogenicity.\r\n In pre-clinical studies, vaccine droplets are applied under the tongue on the floor of the mouth and the animal is kept under sedation for less than 1 h to allow the vaccine to be taken up (see Table 2 ). For sublingual vaccination of mice 5 \u03bcl can be applied sublingually without transfer of the vaccine to the stomach (including a sedation time of 30 min) [48, 57] .\r\n Sublingual administration of allergens to humans by droplets has been used for years in Europe in sublingual immune therapy (SLIT) against allergies. Typically, in SLIT, droplets of a highly viscous glycerol formulation containing the allergen extract are applied under the tongue. The high viscosity contributes to antigen retention under the tongue and as such facilitates the efficacy of the immune therapy.\r\n In a recent clinical trial, HPV vaccine was applied sublingually to humans. Compared to SLIT with glycerol droplets, a relatively complicated administration protocol was used in this study. In brief, subjects rinsed their mouths with water, the sublingual area was dried and then 0.5 ml of vaccine was applied on the floor of the mouth. Adsorbent pads were applied in the mouth to absorb the saliva during and after the vaccine application. Despite the elaborate administration protocol, in only three of the twelve subjects were virus-neutralizing antibodies induced in serum after three standard doses of HPV vaccine via the sublingual route. These neutralizing antibody titers were still 1000-fold lower than in the intramuscular group. Researchers concluded that alternative delivery systems and adjuvants would be required to enhance and evaluate immune responses following sublingual immunization in humans [68] .\r\n The disappointing results of this clinical trial may be related to several factors. First, a significant amount of solution (0.5 ml versus 'a couple of droplets' in SLIT therapy) was applied. Despite the extensive administration protocol, a certain high volume will easily be digested and will follow the gastro-intestinal route. Secondly, the vaccine used in the study (Gardasil\u00ae) is a VLP based vaccine containing aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate as adjuvant. An alum-adsorbed vaccine has a large particle size (in the range of 1 \u03bcm) and thus is not ideal for transfer over membranes. Finally, alum is not known to be a good adjuvant for mucosal vaccination.\r\n Droplets for improved (extended) mucosal retention are currently under development by PATH [69] . Their technology is based on a thermo-responsive gel of undisclosed composition. The vaccine is presented as a liquid solution at room temperature, which enables sublingual delivery with an oral dropper, and transforms into a gel upon contact with the oral mucosa. Typical thermo-responsive gel formulations that gelate at a temperature above 30\u00b0C are based on polymers, such as poloxamer and mucoadhesive polysaccharides. The gel matrix enables adherence (retention N 20 min.) to the sublingual mucosa thereby preventing rapid clearance caused by salivation or swallowing and protecting the vaccine antigen from degradation caused by salivary enzymes. Vaccinating mice with a gel formulation containing tetanus toxoid elicits high levels of IgG and IgA in serum as well as in secretions of the mouth, gastrointestinal and reproductive tract. Currently, PATH is evaluating (pre-clinically) whether the addition of a mucosal adjuvant, dmLT, can contribute to the efficacy of sublingual vaccination using thermo-responsive gel formulations [69] .\r\n Sublingual sprays have been used for years for the sublingual administration of nitroglycerine to patients in order to counter an acute angina pectoris. The most used nitroglycerine sprays are based on a formulation containing the drug substance, ethanol, a small amount of mint oil and a propellant, like tetrafluoroethane, to aerosolize the formulation. We are not aware of any investigations into direct spraying of the vaccine onto the sublingual or buccal mucosa.\r\n A few studies, however, have applied vaccine sprays into the whole mouth. Immunization of humans with influenza whole inactivated virus (H1N1) without additives, such as an oral spray using a simple nasal spraying device (no use of propellant), did not result in IgA antibody responses in nasal secretions and only resulted in marginally increased IgA antibodies in saliva. Although no stimulation of cytotoxic T cells was shown, an increase in systemic influenza-specific antibodies was found [70] .\r\n To what extent the immune response elicited by sublingual vaccination is the result of direct immune activation of the tonsils remains a matter of debate. For example, it has been shown that direct immunization via the tonsils can give rise to adequate immune responses. Oral spray immunization with replication-deficient viral vector vaccines encoding simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) sprayed directly on the tonsils of rhesus macaques induced cellular and humoral immune responses. Additionally, after SIV challenge viral RNA levels were equally reduced after systemic vaccination and vaccination through the use of the oral mucosal spray [139].\r\n Several oral formulations are already licensed or are in development for drug delivery in the mouth. Based on their drug release kinetics and manufacturing method they can be categorized as: I) orally disintegrating preparations (tablets and fast-dissolving films) and II) extended (slow) release tablets and films. Although their value for sublingual and buccal delivery of antigens has not yet been extensively evaluated, they will be described briefly in the next section since they may play an important role in the development of potent and thermo-stable sublingual vaccines.\r\n Orally disintegrating tablets for sublingual or buccal delivery are in general relatively small and porous. Tablets for buccal delivery facilitate fast disintegration and drug or vaccine release without inclusion of a disintegrant. In general, these tablets dissolve within a few seconds after being placed in the mouth without water, making them dried (stable) alternatives for droplets.\r\n Recently, several excipients were studied for their wafer formation abilities (highly porous tablets made by direct compression) with the intention to formulate wafers containing HPV vaccine for sublingual vaccination [71] . A typical fast-disintegrating formulation for the generation of wafers with a diameter of 4 mm that showed a dissolution time of less than 25 s (in 3 ml at 37\u00b0C) consisted of approximately 65% (w\/w) myo-inositol (the placebo HPV powder) and 35% microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) [71] .\r\n To effectively vaccinate via the sublingual and buccal mucosae, the contact time of the antigen with the mucosa is expected to be critical, although this remains to be demonstrated. Sustained release dosage forms adhere to the mucosa and direct transport of the antigen to the mucosa may improve the efficacy of sublingual and buccal vaccination. In this regard, extended release films or tablets that consist of multiple layers with different functions (Fig. 3 ) may be applied. The sublingual mucosa is exposed to a high saliva flow, which might be advantageous for a better swelling and dissolution of oral tablets. On the other hand, it might also cause loss of the antigen and adjuvant due to salivary washout. Therefore, the much lower saliva flow of buccal mucosa makes this route probably a better target for a sustained release system.\r\n Extended release tablets are typically based on gelling hydrophilic polymers, so-called hydrophilic matrix tablets. The polymers form a gel layer around the tablet when they make contact with water. The release profile is controlled by the overall swelling and erosion [72] . Most polymers that are used as mucoadhesives are hydrophilic polymers that gelate upon contact with saliva, allowing adherence to the buccal mucosa by interfacial forces, such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction as well as van der Waal's bonds.\r\n Borde et al. [73] prepared extended release tablets for the model antigen ovalbumin, based on two-layer tablets consisting of a mucoadhesive layer, which is composed of carbopol, and a controlled release layer. Since the tablets were not able to adhere to the floor of the mouth in mice, the tablets were applied upside down to the ventral side of the tongue, resulting in the release of the antigen toward the sublingual region. Immunization studies were performed with tablets containing 250 \u03bcg ovalbumin directly followed by sublingual administration of a 1 \u03bcg\/ml CT solution (7.5 \u03bcl) as adjuvant. Immunization with a fastreleasing tablet was favorable over extended release formulations and comparable to the liquid reference (ovalbumin with CT) for the immune response. However, the production of saliva was induced by administering pilocarpine subcutaneously before administering the tablet to provide better swelling and adhesion of the tablets [73] . The authors concluded that extended release formulations for sublingual vaccination have to be investigated more in detail. Extended release formulations for mice have to be optimized to direct the antigen toward the ventral sublingual mucosa. This will improve the antigen diffusion and prevent the salivary washout and the impact of enzymes by shielding.\r\n Extended release films based on multiple layers are generally made by the solvent casting method [74] for which the antigen is added to a coating mass (e.g., cellulose, polysaccharides) and subsequently cast onto a film application apparatus. After drying and solvent evaporation, the films can be cut into single doses.\r\n The viscosity and density of the coating mass are critical for successful film casting (layer-by-layer coating). Moreover, the vaccine antigen needs to be formulated in the coating mass with proper excipients to guarantee resistance to the applied drying stresses [75] . Formulations that have been proven to protect vaccines during the fabrication of coated solid dosage forms have been described in literature but are not yet used to produce vaccine-containing films. For example, the group of Prausnitz applied formulations based on trehalose, surfactant (poloxamer) and a polymer (PVP) to coat microneedles with vaccines such as the whole inactivated influenza virus [76] and measles [77] for dermal vaccination. An additional advantage of dried formulations is the improved thermal stability during storage.\r\n The oral mucosae, in particular the sublingual and buccal regions are attractive sites for the delivery of antigens, since their accessibility, noninvasive and (immunological) advantages over other (mucosal) routes (Section 2.1). Therefore, sublingual vaccine delivery has gained significant attention during the past few years, as shown by the numerous pre-clinical studies published in the last decade ( Table 2) .\r\n The preclinical proof of concept of the sublingual route for vaccine delivery has been proven for several antigens. In general, high doses of antigen (10-500 \u03bcg) are administered in mice using a multiple dosing regimen (Table 2) . However, well-designed studies including proper dose response and tracking (PK\/PD) studies are still lacking. Nevertheless, the use of strong mucosal adjuvants seems to be necessary to induce protective immune responses upon sublingual vaccination using inactivated vaccines. Reported studies on screening and comparison of adjuvants for sublingual vaccination, unfortunately, are still limited. Of the adjuvants investigated thus far (CT, CTB, LT, LTB, mLT, dmLT, CpG, c-di-GMP, L18-MDP, FSL-1, Poly(I:C), MPLA, Pam3CSK4, R848, murabutide, peptidoglycans, vitamin D3, chitosan and poly-gammaglutamic acid), enterotoxins (and their mutants) and TLR-9 agonists resulted in the highest antibody responses whereas the other adjuvants did not improve immune responses upon sublingual delivery. The most used adjuvants for sublingual vaccine delivery are the enterotoxins CT and LT, which are considered too toxic for human use. However, genetically defined mutants of these toxins, which have reduced or minimal toxicity, seemed to be promising adjuvants to augment both systemic and mucosal immunity in response to sublingual administration.\r\n Recombinant live carriers expressing the vaccine antigen seemed to elicit protective immunity by inducing both antigen-specific systemic as well as mucosal antibodies at distinct mucosal sites [28, 32] . The exact advantage of such live vaccines over inactivated vaccines is still not clear, but it could be related to factors such as receptor-mediated uptake, intracellular replication of antigens and co-delivery of immune potentiators and antigens to APCs.\r\n An approach that resembles the characteristics of the live pathogens, e.g., by co-delivery of immune potentiator and antigen, is needed to develop an effective inactivated (subunit) vaccine for the sublingual route. Unfortunately, to date, limited studies have focused on such approaches that use tailored formulations, such as nanoparticles or conjugated antigen-adjuvant formulations. In the design of these formulations, mucoadhesive or receptor-binding properties may be built in to increase interaction with the oral mucosa and thereby facilitate antigen uptake.\r\n In addition to delivery systems, dosage forms may improve the efficacy of sublingual and buccal vaccines. Today, research on dosage form optimization for sublingual or buccal vaccination appears marginal. The few reported studies use mouse models to evaluate sublingual vaccination in vivo. Nevertheless, the small space under the tongue of animals used for preclinical studies makes testing of sublingual solid dosage forms challenging. For example, Muragappan et al. faced the problem that sublingual tablets were not able to dissolve under the tongue of mice [40] . Moreover, two-layered extended release tablets failed to adhere to the floor of the mouth in mice, resulting in a suboptimal administration that applied the tablet upside down on the ventral side of the tongue [73] . Potential problems related to the sublingual application of slow release formulations are due to the lack of an expanse of smooth or (relatively) immobile mucosa, which make it difficult to keep the dosage form in contact with the sublingual mucosa. Other dosage forms, such as wafers, films and thermo-responsive gels, should be explored as these may likely increase the potential of sublingual vaccine delivery. Sustained dosage forms (e.g., multi-layered oral films or tablets) are probably better suited for application on the buccal mucosa, which is considerably less permeable than the sublingual mucosa. The few current studies on buccal vaccine delivery use buccal injections instead of a topical application. However, the development of the extended release formulations would make topical buccal cheek vaccination easier. Compared to the sublingual route, buccal administration in small animals, such as mice, is more complicated since the buccal compartment has a minimal anatomical barrier with the sublingual compartment. Besides the animal size, the anatomical features of the oral cavity should be taken into account, because of the specialized histological characteristics and immunological competences of the oral mucosae in humans. However, most rodents, such as mice, rats and hamsters, have buccal mucosa that contains keratinized epithelium, in contrast to non-keratinized epithelium of sublingual and cheek mucosae in human. For buccal cheek administration, other animal models such as rabbits, dogs and pigs are more appropriate since they contain nonkeratinized buccal mucosae. Moreover, the thickness of the buccal mucosa in these animal models (rabbit, 600 \u03bcm; dog and pig, 770 \u03bcm) is comparable to that of humans (500-800 \u03bcm) [78] . Current literature does not address to which extent mucoadhesive formulations increase the delivery of the antigen to oral mucosal APCs after sublingual or buccal administration, requiring proper tracking (pharmacokinetics, PK) studies in relation with immunological outcome (pharmacodynamics, PD) in adequate animal models (Table 3) .\r\n To select suitable formulations and dosage forms, an in vitro model for the mucosa that can predict the transport of an antigen might be useful. Porcine buccal mucosa is often chosen for in vitro studies on buccal delivery of medicines because of its close resemblance to human buccal mucosa with respect to structure, enzyme activity as well as permeability characteristics [79] . However, mechanistic studies evaluating the conditions for sublingual or buccal antigen delivery, such as optimal contact time of the dosage form and the differences between the oral mucosal routes, are lacking in literature. Moreover, the importance of specific molecular features of the antigen and\/or antigen formulation, such as size (e.g., 1-10 nm proteins versus 10-250 nm viruses versus 250 nm-2 \u03bcm bacteria), surface charge or specific receptor ligands, is still not investigated systematically.\r\n Most pre-clinical studies (in vivo animal models) are used to evaluate the vaccine candidate's efficiency to induce protective mucosal (and systemic) immunity. Secretory IgA (sIgA) provides antigenspecific immune protection in mucosal tissues. As a result, most preclinical studies on sublingual vaccination include the detection of sIgA in mucosal secretions. Unfortunately, most studies are designed for an optimal readout of systemic immune responses, making assumptions on mucosal immunity not fully conclusive. Moreover, in general, the presence of sIgA is determined in saliva, which is not the best readout for mucosal immunity, especially for rodents [80] . A more predictive method to measure mucosal immunity in mucosal tissues of rodents is the 'Perfext method', which is a direct method for quantitative assessment of in vivo antibody or cytokine production at the local level [81] . The method uses the collection of heparinized mucosal tissue of the animal followed by detergent treatment and the detection of antigenspecific antibodies by ELISA [53, 55] .\r\n Based on several pre-clinical studies, it would be highly interesting to follow the expected upcoming clinical studies on sublingual vaccine delivery (using live attenuated vaccines). These studies should build on the experience of previous preclinical studies that were designed to evaluate mucosal immunity as a correlate of protection, which would require standardized and validated assays predictive of mucosal immune protection [82] . For example, a method described by Saletti et al. allows measurements of both systemic and mucosal antibody responses to vaccines by detecting antigen-specific plasmablasts with a specific mucosal pedigree (e.g., \u03b14\u03b27, CCR10) on small amounts of whole blood [83] . Although it was developed for clinical samples, a certain type of mucosal readout would also be useful for pre-clinical studies, amid limited blood volumes that can be sequentially withdrawn from small animals. The full benefits of sublingual vaccination can only be revealed by the determination of both local and systemic responses.\r\n Current literature on sublingual and buccal vaccination with a broad range of antigens provides a strong base for further testing of these noninvasive vaccine delivery routes. This testing should include mechanistic studies on the superiority of live vaccines over inactivated antigens, including dose-response studies (Table 3 ). Based on the findings, tailored vaccine formulations for inactivated antigens may be designed in the near future. Development of these sophisticated formulations and optimized dosage forms that facilitate antigen uptake by the oral mucosa will be an important step forward toward successful sublingual and\/or buccal vaccination. Finally, upcoming clinical studies that confirm the suggested safety and efficiency (by proper readout of both mucosal and systemic immunity) may result in the first approved sublingual vaccination strategy.

Vaccination saves millions of lives every year, while bringing numerous social and economic benefits [1] . These vaccines are used for sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) to treat allergic hypersensitivity. This has resulted in several approved sublingual products for allergy immunotherapy, such as SLITone\u00ae, Sublivac\u00ae, Grazax\u00ae, Oralair\u00ae, and AllerSlit\u00aeforte. Allergy vaccines are reviewed by Valenta et al. [ In this review, we will describe the potential and limitations of the sublingual and buccal mucosae as vaccine delivery sites and the mucosal immune responses that are induced upon sublingual or buccal vaccination. Within the oral cavity, some mucosal regions are lined by a keratinized stratified epithelium (gingival, hard palate, outer lips), whereas other regions are lined by a non-keratinized stratified epithelium (Fig. The floor of the mouth, the inner surface of the lips and cheeks, and the ventral side of the tongue are covered by a non-keratinized epithelium, rendering these relatively more elastic and pervious than keratinized mucosae, and thus potentially more suitable for drug or antigen delivery. The epithelium serves as a mechanical barrier protecting the underlying tissues and consists of a basal layer, an intermediate layer, and a superficial layer. The compacted, flattened cells of the lower superficial and intermediate layers form the major physical barrier to transport, whereas the intercellular lipids play an important role in the permeability of the mucosa. The basal layer includes Merkel cells, which are endocrine cells associated with nerve fibers that contribute to the overall barrier function of the epithelium. Table 1 shows an overview of characteristics of different sites that have been investigated for vaccine delivery. However, dermal vaccination has the disadvantage that the impermeable thick keratinized stratum corneum acts as a physiological barrier for the diffusion of antigens to reach LCs after topical administration. Compared to gastro-intestinal mucosal routes, degradation by gastric fluids and gastrointestinal enzymes is avoided during sublingual or buccal delivery, although some enzymatic activity is present in the mouth. Antigen delivery and antigen presentation following sublingual or buccal vaccination. Upon vaccine delivery, the antigen is likely to be captured by Langerhans cells (LC) within the mucosa itself and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) along the lamina propria. Antigen-bearing DCs will migrate to draining lymph nodes where they interact with na\u00efve CD4 and CD8 T cells to support the differentiation into effector T cells (i.e., helper (Th) and cytotoxic T cells (CTL)) and thereby induction of the adaptive immune response. Since different studies failed to detect specific sampling cells (or M-like structures) in the sublingual or buccal mucosa [14, 15] , it seems most likely that antigens cross the ductal epithelium via paracellular and transcellular pathways [14] . The thickness of the human buccal mucosa has been estimated to be in the range of 500-800 \u03bcm, whereas the mucosal thickness of the sublingual region is about 100-200 \u03bcm [16] . Moreover, the presence of digestive enzymes could lead to degradation of the antigen. Rare pro-inflammatory cells, i.e., histamine-containing mast cells (MC) or eosinophils (Eos) (Fig. The relatively high frequency of LCs and low numbers of mast cells in the buccal region [19] make the buccal mucosa an attractive site for vaccine delivery despite its thicker epithelium and lower permeability as compared to the sublingual mucosa. Upon activation, T and B cells that leave the site of the initial antigen presentation, enter the circulation and then disperse to selected mucosal sites, where they differentiate into memory or effector cells. The activation of CD4 T lymphocytes leads to the induction of antigen-specific helper T (Th cells) and\/or regulatory T cell (Treg) mediated immune responses (Fig. Furthermore, we will outline adjuvants, i.e., immune potentiators and\/or delivery systems, that have been evaluated for vaccination via the sublingual or buccal route. Thereby, the risk of potential passage of vaccine virus to the olfactory bulb was avoided by using the sublingual route since no viral RNA was detected in brains of sublingually vaccinated mice, in contrast to mice that received the same vaccine intranasally [26] . Sublingual immunization with these DeltaNS1 viruses induced high levels of virus-specific antibodies and stimulated immune cells in mucosaassociated and systemic lymphoid organs [27] . Replication-defective adenovirus vectors (rAdV) have been widely explored for the delivery of antigens. Infection by adenoviruses occurs through the airway epithelium and replication takes place in mucosal tissues of the respiratory tract. These immune responses were similar to those induced by intranasal administration. reported that both mice and guinea pigs were protected against a lethal Ebola challenge after a single sublingual immunization with an AdV-based vaccine expressing the Zaire glycoprotein in a manner similar to that of traditional intramuscular vaccination [33] . In addition, the recombinant spores have been shown to germinate after oral delivery resulting in intracellular expression of the antigen. Among these routes, the intranasal and sublingual routes provided the highest HPV16L1-specific levels of vaginal sIgA and systemic IgG responses that were comparable to those elicited via the intramuscular route [45] . Sublingual vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with a purified G protein fragment (Gcf) without the addition of adjuvants induced strong serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses (similar to intranasal vaccination) in mice. a sublingual booster was given, instead of an intramuscular booster, and immune responses were analyzed more extensively. Unfortunately, the analysis of CTL activation is lacking in the study using BPL-inactivated influenza. evaluated the sublingual route for vaccine delivery using ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen. After three doses, detectable, but rather low, antigenspecific systemic IgG and HI titers were found after sublingual immunization, whereas mucosal IgA antibodies were below the detection limit. This was observed in both adult [51] and neonatal mice [50] . continued on next page) The adjuvant effect of sublingually administered CT has been documented with a number of antigens, including influenza [43] and HIV [48] subunit vaccines, Salmonella proteins [50, 51] and Helicobacter pylori lysates [54, 55] with the latter two as undefined vaccines. LT, when co-administered sublingually with tetanus toxoid (TT) induced higher specific IgG and mucosal IgA antibody titers when compared to TT alone [57] . In the search for an alternative adjuvant for a H. pylori lysate vaccine, dmLT was compared to CT. Earlier studies have shown that a strong mucosal adjuvant like CT was needed to induce protective immune responses against H. pylori infection. A mouse study evaluating TLR agonists (i.e., FSL-1, Poly(I:C), monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), Pam3CSK4, R848, cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG)) in different mucosal routes using HIV gp140 and a tetanus toxoid revealed clear differences in immunogenicity [49] . Bacterial DNA or synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) containing CpG motifs act as mucosal adjuvants. However, this alum adjuvanted VLP formulation is not suitable for sublingual HPV vaccination, which is likely due to the fact that alum adjuvants consist of relatively large (micrometer range) particles that are probably poorly taken up by mucosal epithelial cells. Optimized dosage forms may improve the performance of sublingual and buccal vaccines substantially. Several dosage forms exist for sublingual and buccal delivery of marketed drugs. These range from droplets, sprays, and orally disintegrating tablets to oral films. In a recent clinical trial, HPV vaccine was applied sublingually to humans. The disappointing results of this clinical trial may be related to several factors. Typical thermo-responsive gel formulations that gelate at a temperature above 30\u00b0C are based on polymers, such as poloxamer and mucoadhesive polysaccharides. The gel matrix enables adherence (retention N 20 min.) Currently, PATH is evaluating (pre-clinically) whether the addition of a mucosal adjuvant, dmLT, can contribute to the efficacy of sublingual vaccination using thermo-responsive gel formulations [69] . Sublingual sprays have been used for years for the sublingual administration of nitroglycerine to patients in order to counter an acute angina pectoris. A few studies, however, have applied vaccine sprays into the whole mouth. Several oral formulations are already licensed or are in development for drug delivery in the mouth. Although their value for sublingual and buccal delivery of antigens has not yet been extensively evaluated, they will be described briefly in the next section since they may play an important role in the development of potent and thermo-stable sublingual vaccines. Tablets for buccal delivery facilitate fast disintegration and drug or vaccine release without inclusion of a disintegrant. In general, these tablets dissolve within a few seconds after being placed in the mouth without water, making them dried (stable) alternatives for droplets. The sublingual mucosa is exposed to a high saliva flow, which might be advantageous for a better swelling and dissolution of oral tablets. On the other hand, it might also cause loss of the antigen and adjuvant due to salivary washout. The release profile is controlled by the overall swelling and erosion [72] . Since the tablets were not able to adhere to the floor of the mouth in mice, the tablets were applied upside down to the ventral side of the tongue, resulting in the release of the antigen toward the sublingual region. Extended release films based on multiple layers are generally made by the solvent casting method [74] for which the antigen is added to a coating mass (e.g., cellulose, polysaccharides) and subsequently cast onto a film application apparatus. The viscosity and density of the coating mass are critical for successful film casting (layer-by-layer coating). An additional advantage of dried formulations is the improved thermal stability during storage. The preclinical proof of concept of the sublingual route for vaccine delivery has been proven for several antigens. Nevertheless, the small space under the tongue of animals used for preclinical studies makes testing of sublingual solid dosage forms challenging. faced the problem that sublingual tablets were not able to dissolve under the tongue of mice [40] . Sustained dosage forms (e.g., multi-layered oral films or tablets) are probably better suited for application on the buccal mucosa, which is considerably less permeable than the sublingual mucosa. However, the development of the extended release formulations would make topical buccal cheek vaccination easier. For buccal cheek administration, other animal models such as rabbits, dogs and pigs are more appropriate since they contain nonkeratinized buccal mucosae. Porcine buccal mucosa is often chosen for in vitro studies on buccal delivery of medicines because of its close resemblance to human buccal mucosa with respect to structure, enzyme activity as well as permeability characteristics [79] . Most pre-clinical studies (in vivo animal models) are used to evaluate the vaccine candidate's efficiency to induce protective mucosal (and systemic) immunity. As a result, most preclinical studies on sublingual vaccination include the detection of sIgA in mucosal secretions. Based on the findings, tailored vaccine formulations for inactivated antigens may be designed in the near future."},{"Unnamed: 0":54,"Unnamed: 0.1":54,"doc_id":"36eaec58a5d37602d2932074f554858a22acdfe3","title":"Pulmonary DNA vaccination: Concepts, possibilities and perspectives","abstract":"Mucosal immunity establishes the first line of defence against pathogens entering the body via mucosal surfaces. Besides eliciting both local and systemic immunity, mucosal vaccination strategies that are non-invasive in nature may increase patient compliance and reduce the need for vaccine application by trained personnel. A relatively new concept is mucosal immunization using DNA vaccines. The advantages of DNA vaccines, such as the opportunity to combine the genetic information of various antigen epitopes and stimulatory cytokines, the enhanced stability and ease of production make this class of vaccines attractive and suitable for mucosal application. In contrast to the area of intranasal vaccination, only a few recent studies have focused on pulmonary immunization and the involvement of the pulmonary immune system in eliciting protective immune responses against inhaled pathogens. This review focuses on DNA vaccine delivery to the lung as a promising approach to prevent pulmonaryassociated diseases caused by inhaled pathogens. Attractive immunological features of the lung as a site for immunization, the mechanisms of action of DNA vaccines and the pulmonary application of such vaccines using novel delivery systems will be discussed. We also examine pulmonary diseases prone to prevention or therapeutical intervention by application of DNA vaccines. D","text_body":"Mucosal vaccine delivery embraces appealing characteristics for new immunization strategies against invading pathogens. The majority of human pathogens enter the body via mucosal surfaces in contact with the environment in the nose, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. Mucosal vaccination at these sites can result in prevention of pathogen entry into the systemic circulation by local immune responses or in induction of systemic immunity and prevention of infection spread. In addition, there are many practical reasons that make mucosal vaccination strategies favourable in comparison to injected vaccines. Easier and less painful administration, reduced risk associated with injected vaccines and possible elimination of the cold chain are only some of the benefits associated with mucosal vaccines.\r\n The pulmonary epithelium itself has a crucial role in host defence against inhaled pathogens since it presents a physical barrier including the mucociliary escalator, which in concert with the secreted antimicrobial agents that are present in the mucus layer covering the airway epithelium prevents colonization of microorganisms. Additionally, the lung has many attractive immunolog-ical properties. Organized lymphoid follicles, known as the broncho-alveolar lymphoid tissue (BALT) and local antigen-presenting cells (APCs) located ideally to sample antigens entering the airways are found in the lung.\r\n DNA vaccines constitute an exciting new approach in vaccine development. The vaccine construct is created by insertion of a DNA encoding the desired antigen into a bacterial plasmid vector. The extent to which the plasmid DNA is able to transfect cells is dependent on the application route and the delivery system used. The encoded protein is then expressed in the transfected cells in vivo and consequently, an immune response is elicited to the expressed antigen [1] .\r\n In this manuscript we present the rationale and potential of pulmonary DNA immunization. We describe the major features of pulmonary immunology and give an overview of DNA vaccines in general and in association with pulmonary pathologies. In addition, we discuss the main work performed so far in the field of pulmonary DNA vaccine delivery and argue that direct vaccine application to the lower respiratory tract will be beneficial in protecting against inhaled pathogens causing life-threatening diseases.\r\n The respiratory tract continues beyond the larynx as the trachea, which then divides into two primary bronchi. Further branching from the bronchi are the bronchioles, terminal bronchioles and in the further branching of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli where the exchange of oxygen and CO 2 with the blood occurs [2] . The proximal airways represent a pseudostratified columnar epithelium, composed of ciliated cells, basal cells and smaller number of goblet cells (Fig. 1 ). Goblet cells in the superficial epithelium and mucous cells in the submucosal glands secrete mucus into the respiratory lining. In the more distal airways the epithelium becomes less multilayered, glands are less frequent and cells become less columnar. The alveolar surface is composed mainly of type I and type II pneumocytes that function as gas-exchange pneumocytes and surfactant secreting cells, respectively [2, 3] .\r\n The initial barrier to prevent pathogen entry into the airways is formed by epithelial cells that effectively separate the luminal surface from the basolateral sur-face. In the proximal airways, large particles (N 5 Am in diameter) are trapped in the mucus and cleared by the mucociliary escalator and by coughing. Additional defence mechanisms are necessary to maintain lung sterility since most of the pathogens are smaller than 5 Am. The cells lining the upper and lower respiratory tract were shown to produce a variety of molecules that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses [3] [4] [5] [6] . By secreting these mediators, the pulmonary epithelium is capable of recruiting and activating cells of the innate immune system, killing pathogens and initiating an adaptive immune response. The airways have a constant antimicrobial environment provided by both constitutively expressed chemical defences and inducible chemical defences which are enhanced in response to infection.\r\n The secreted molecules in the lung can be categorized into antimicrobial substances, chemotactic mediators and inflammatory mediators. Antimicrobial products are secreted from secretory cells in the mucosa and possess direct antimicrobial activity or facilitate the elimination of infectious pathogens by phagocytes. Defensins [7] [8] [9] , cathelicidins [10] [11] [12] and collectins [13] [14] [15] are the principal antimicrobial peptides families that are expressed in the respiratory tract. Another important molecule with antimicrobial function secreted from pulmonary epithelial cells is immunoglobulin A (IgA). It is synthesized in the lamina propria as a dimer that specifically binds to a secretory component on the basolateral surface of the epithelial cells and is internalized as a complex. The complex is then transported to the apical surface of the epithelial cells and released in the airways where it can neutralize viruses and block the entrance of bacterial agents into the body [16, 17] . Other secreted products associated with antimicrobial function in the lungs are lysozyme, lactoferrin, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), transferrin and immunoglobulin G (IgG). Chemotactic agents are induced in response to a variety of stimuli and recruit inflammatory cells to the lung. Immune cells are recruited to the infected area by release of cytokines like IL-1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and granulocyte\/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as well as chemokines and expression of adhesion molecules by airway epithelial cells. Important inflammatory mediators that were shown to play an important role in pulmonary host defence include the cytokines TNF-a, IL-12, IL-10, interferon gamma (IFN-g) and GM-CSF. The inflammatory reaction will stay localized within the infected tissue as long as no pathological changes occur. Lung injury may result in cytokine leakage to the circulation and a systemic cytokine response [4] [5] [6] .\r\n Pulmonary epithelial cells can act as antigenpresenting and immunoregulatory cells of the lung. Bronchial epithelial cells were shown to express HLA-DR class II molecules on their surface as well as HLA-DR mRNA [18] . These cells are able to stimulate T cells and the expression of MHC class II molecules is modulated by immune mediators like IFN-g [19] . Nevertheless, human bronchial epithelial cells do not express the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 that are required for efficient APC function [20] . By contrast, in addition to MHC class II molecules, type II alveolar epithelial cells can also express co-stimulatory molecules and these are able to deliver co-stimulatory signals to T cells [21] . This shows another role for pulmonary epithelial cells as antigen-presenting and immunoregulatory cells in the respiratory tract.\r\n Phagocytic cells like macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) are essential for protection against inhaled pathogens. They play a role in both innate and adaptive immunity of the respiratory tract and a failure to function results in immunodeficiency and disease.\r\n Macrophages are a versatile population of cells that have many functions in the human body. Although showing large diversity, it is clear that these cells have a role in protection and preservation of tissue integrity. These cells remove debris generated by the host, protect from infectious pathogens using their microbicidal capacity, promote specific acquired immunity by their antigen presentation capabilities and regulate inflammation and effector mechanisms by secreting soluble mediators [22, 23] .\r\n Pulmonary macrophages are bone marrow derived cells that differentiate from blood monocytes after migrating to the lung. After their recruitment from the capillaries mediated by chemotactic factors, they populate the different lung compartments and differ-entiate into mature lung macrophages. Macrophages can be found in the pleura, interstitium, alveoli and in the pulmonary blood vessels, and are able to migrate from one lung compartment to the other. Subtle differences in cell physiology, membrane antigen expression and function have been observed between macrophages in the different lung compartments. These differences should probably be attributed to the response of the cells to their location and micromilieu rather than to fundamental differences in their development [23, 24] .\r\n Macrophages are an essential element of human innate immunity to inhaled pathogens. Together with other components of the innate immune response, such as pulmonary surfactant, mucus secretion, mucociliary clearance and antimicrobial peptides, macrophages are able to control infection in the lungs, which are constantly exposed to the environment. Elimination of any potential infectious agents is achieved by phagocytosis and subsequent digestion [23, 24] . Macrophages have enhanced phagocytic capabilities through three groups of membrane receptors that facilitate opsonization: Fc receptors (FcgRI, FcgRII, FcgRIII for different IgG subclasses, FcR for IgE and IgA), complement receptors (CR1, CR3, CR4) and lectin receptors (mannose receptor) [25, 26] . Scavenger receptors (SRs) and CD14 on macrophage cell surfaces are associated with phagocytosis of apoptotic cells [27] , and pattern-recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are associated with macrophage stimulation after ligation by their microbial ligands [28] . Following phagocytosis, activated macrophages start to release microbicidal enzymes, reactive oxygen intermediates and T cell stimulatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The success of this non-specific pathogen elimination process is dependent on the pathogen type and load. A small number of microorganisms (~10 5 ) can be eliminated by alveolar macrophages alone while higher inocula (~10 8 ) will require activation of B and T cells for successful clearance. The macrophage's ability to eliminate a specific pathogen is also dependent on the microorganism's species. While Staphylococcus aureus is phagocytosed and killed intracellularly by alveolar macrophages, Mycobacteria spp., Listeria spp. and Legionella pneumophila are readily phagocytosed but no intracellular killing occurs, allowing these pathogens to reside and multi-ply in non-activated macrophages [25] . The decreased susceptibility to infection by these pathogens could be due to interference with TLR and IFN-g-mediated activation pathways in macrophages [29, 30] . More recently it was suggested that human-macrophage plasticity has a critical effect on pathogen survival and alternative activation modes of macrophages can lead to an anti-inflammatory phenotype and persistence of chronic infection [31] .\r\n The macrophage population of the lung also participates in inducing pulmonary acquired immune responses. Macrophages are able to phagocytose, process and present antigens to stimulate T cells. Primary stimulation of T cell clones within the pulmonary lymphoid tissue is induced when alveolar macrophages migrate to bronchial lymph nodes and home to T cell paracortical areas [23, 32] . Pulmonary macrophages also have an effector function in acquired immunity since they are responsive to T cell derived cytokines and respond by increased microbicidal activity. Macrophages also have a regulatory function in acquired immunity. Since the lung is constantly exposed to harmful pathogens, unregulated acquired immune responses can result in a constant state of inflammation and damage to normal tissue and function. The macrophage populations in the lung are heterogeneous and some of the cells exhibit characteristics of suppressive cells [23, 33] . The relative proportions of inductive or suppressive macrophages developing from monocytes can be regulated by T cell cytokines (IFN-g and IL-4 promote the inductive macrophages while IL-10 promotes the development of suppressive cells). Even after maturation, macrophages are able to switch phenotype and function in response to cytokine signals, which is an ideal characteristic for a cell population that is migrating constantly through the different environments within the lung.\r\n Dendritic cells (DCs) are a part of the innate defence system and are initiators and modulators for specific and non-specific immunity. These cells are professional antigen-presenting cells and are present in most tissues. DCs are potent stimulators of T cells and are specialized in uptake, transport, processing and presentation of antigens [34] [35] [36] .\r\n DCs originate from bone marrow haematopoietic stem cells. Circulating precursor DCs enter tissues where they reside as immature DCs with high phagocytic capacity. The phagocytic capacity of immature DCs is established by several mechanisms: phagocytosis of particles and microbes, macropinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis. The last two mechanisms are extremely efficient in antigen sampling and require very small concentrations of the antigen in order to activate DCs. Upon stimulation, immature DCs capture the antigen, migrate to the draining lymphoid organs and differentiate into mature DCs. Maturation of DCs results in a decreased capacity to take up antigens and increased presentation capabilities. Mature DCs can be distinguished from immature DCs by the loss of receptors that are involved in antigen uptake and increased expression of MHC class II molecules, co-stimulatory molecules like CD40, CD58, CD80, CD86 and the maturation marker CD83 [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Following migration, DCs present their previous environment to T cells by displaying the processed antigen's peptides using MHC class-I and MHC class-II molecules, leading to cellular and humoral immune responses [38, 42] .\r\n In the lung, the most pronounced populations of DCs were found in the epithelial linings of the conducting airways. Additional populations exist in the submucosa below the airway epithelium, within alveolar septal walls and on the alveolar surface. It was previously shown that airway epithelial DC turnover time is 2-3 days. Under local stress (e.g. inflammatory state), the turnover of pulmonary DCs further accelerates, indicating their importance in local antigen surveillance [43, 44] . Local antigenic challenge will result in higher density of DCs in the airways and increased expression of activation markers [45, 46] . The level of mature DCs migrating to the peribronchial lymph nodes is increased during the first 24 h of inflammation. However, this response quickly wanes and the respiratory DCs are refractory to further migration in spite of continued inflammatory state. The induction of this refractory state also results in transient inhibition of DC migration in response to a second pulmonary stimulus [47] .\r\n Danger signals from microbial agents can be recognized by DC receptors. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are the main DC receptors to be engaged in the direct recognition of characteristic molecular patterns of antigens. Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns like bacterial nucleic acid, lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by TLRs triggers intracellular signalling that result in DC maturation. This includes upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules, MHC molecules and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ultimately leads to T cell activation. By contrast, CLRs recognize specific carbohydrate structures (pathogen cell-wall components) and internalize the pathogens for degradation in the lysosomal compartment to enhance processing and presentation by DCs. Nevertheless, one should remember that DCs act as bsentinelsQ in the body and hence are sampling both self-and non-self-antigens. It is becoming evident that some of the CLRs, such as dectin-1, DC-SIGN and mannose receptor, may inhibit stimulatory signals. It has been proposed that TLRs and CLRs intersect and dictate the balance between immune-activation and tolerance [48] [49] [50] . It was also suggested that some pathogens such as HIV and Mycobacterium tubercu-losis target DC-SIGN to seek immune escape. The bmisuseQ of DC-SIGN results in pathogen survival by mechanisms that circumvent antigen processing or alter TLR-mediated signalling and skew T cell responses [51] [52] [53] .\r\n DC activation of T cells can result in immunity or tolerance, in activation of effector T cells or regulatory T cells and in different cytokine secretion profiles of T cells, polarizing Th1 and Th2 responses [35, 54] . In addition to the interactions with T cells in the lymphoid organs, DCs interact with other cells like B cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The different and sometimes opposing roles performed by DCs are not likely to be carried out by the same cell and therefore different subtypes of DCs were identified. These subsets differ in their phenotype, localization and function. The two subsets effecting Th1\/Th2 balance are plasmacytoid DCs (also known as the DC2 subset) localized in T cell zones of lymphoid tissues and are associated with Th2 responses. The other subset is myeloid DCs (DC1 subset) localized in the intersti- tium and in germinal centers of various tissues and is associated with Th1 responses [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . The development of two functionally different sublineages could be explained by two models (Fig. 2) : a single lineage that depends on local environmental signals (the functional plasticity model) or two different lineages that became committed at early developmental stage (the specialized lineage model). It seems that reality is a mixture of both models and there is functional plasticity influenced by environmental cytokines in both DCs and their precursors [35, 38, 60] . It is clear by now that several factors control the T helper balance of the immune response initiated by DCs: the DC lineage (DC1\/DC2), the maturation signal and the inflammatory mediators present in the microenvironment [61] [62] [63] [64] . The bdefaultQ T helper response at mucosal surfaces is Th2, which might be due to an inherent property of the resident DC and macrophage populations. Induction of Th1 responses in the lungs will require exposure of DCs to appropriate stimulus and high level production of IL-12 [35, [65] [66] [67] [68] ].\r\n The innate immune system can sense pathogenic microorganisms through TLRs, a major class of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLRs were discovered in the fruitfly Drosophila and are conserved throughout evolution [69] [70] [71] [72] . It was shown that drosophila, mouse, human and several more species possess a similar number of TLRs [73, 74] . Eleven human TLRs have now been identified that are able to recognize structurally unrelated ligands [75] [76] [77] [78] . TLR-activating ligands (summarized in Table  1 ) include lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bacterial lipoproteins, unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, double stranded RNA (dsRNA), and others [79] [80] [81] . Not all TLRs are expressed on the cell surface, a feature that is in accordance with the nature of the different TLRs ligands. TLR4 was found to be localized at the cell membrane, while TLR9 and TLR3 are localized intracellularly. LPS is present in the cell wall of the pathogen and is therefore recognized upon first contact with the host cell by TLR4 located on the cell surface. However, as bacterial DNA resides inside the bacteria, endo-lysosomal degradation of the pathogen's cell wall is required before it is available for recognition by TLR9 present in the endosomal compartment of APCs [82] [83] [84] . An exception to LPS response is intestinal epithelial cells where TLR4 is localized in the Golgi apparatus [85] .\r\n TLRs are expressed in cells that are located and involved in the first line of defence like mucosal epithelial cells, macrophages, DCs, dermal endothelial cells and neutrophils [86] . Higher levels of TLR mRNA were shown to be expressed in tissues that are exposed to the external environment like the lung and the gastrointestinal tract, as well as at immunologically active sites such as peripheral blood leukocytes and the spleen [87] . Different cells can show distinct sets of TLR expression leading to differences in the reactivity to microbial molecules. This suggests that cells have undergone a distinct evolutionary development pathway, enabling them to recognize different pathogens. In DCs, the expression pattern has widely been explored and it was found that monocytes (DC1s) preferentially express TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 8 and plasmacytoid DCs (DC2s) express TLR7 and TLR9 [88, 89] .\r\n The role of TLRs in pulmonary infections and lung disease is being intensively investigated (reviewed in Ref. [90] ). Recently, expression of all known TLRs was reported in an airway epithelial cell line and in primary bronchial epithelial cells, however, TLRs 2, 3, 5 and 6 were the most highly expressed [91] . The interaction between inhaled pathogens and innate immunity is mediated by TLRs expressed on pulmonary epithelial cells lining the airways and the network of APCs present in the lungs. The most explored interaction is that of pulmonary pathogens with TLRs 2 and 4. Human airway epithelial cells express TLR2 and their activation enhances the host defence by increasing expression of the antimicrobial peptide human hdefensin 2 [92, 93] . TLR4 was shown to be constitutively expressed in human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells and despite its intracellular localization, lung epithelial cells responded to LPS [94] . Respiratory syncytial virus was shown to upregulate TLR4 mRNA and protein expression and increase TLR4 localization on the membrane of airway epithelial cells. This increased interaction between LPS and TLR4 expressed on lung epithelial cells can promote airway inflammation response during RSV infection [95] . In bacterial infection, TLR4 is associated with recognition of gramnegative bacterial LPS while TLR2 has the capacity to recognize major cell-wall constituents of gram-positive bacteria. Despite this generally accepted model, involvement of both receptors in the immune response against the gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated and confirmed. A point of debate is to which extent TLR2 and TLR4 are involved in antibacterial host defence, and contradictory in vivo results were obtained, likely due to differences in the bacterial challenge models [96] [97] [98] [99] . Determining the roles of TLRs in host defence against M. tuberculosis has also focused mainly on TLR2 and 4 [100] . It was suggested that TLR2 has an important function in immunity to tuberculosis [101, 102] , however, TLR4 did not have a significant role in immunity to tuberculosis in the mouse model [103] [104] [105] . Although evidence was collected to show involvement of TLRs in immunity to pulmonary pathogens, future work should define more clearly the extent to which the host defence against these pathogens is dependent on TLR signalling, including the bacterial pathogen and load involved. \r\n The BALT is the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) of the respiratory tract. It is a secondary lymphoid tissue comprised of non-encapsulated accumulation of lymphoid tissue. Specialized epithelial cells with microfolds on their luminal side, also known as M cells, are the principal site for sampling of mucosal antigens and transferring antigens unchanged to the underlying dome area that contains many APCs and T cells (Fig. 3) . Stimulation by an antigen will result in generation of secretory IgA antibodies, which are able to cross epithelial membranes and help in the prevention of future entry of pathogens through the mucosal site. Furthermore, lymphocytes that were stimulated by antigens in the mucosal inductive site migrate via the regional lymph nodes and the thoracic duct to the blood stream and from there to other mucosal effector sites. This migration leads to IgA production at other mucosal sites of the MALT (gut, nasal, and genitourinary-associated lymphoid tissues) and was termed the common mucosal immune system (CMIS) [106] [107] [108] [109] . The CMIS appears to have organ selectivity as enhanced memory is seen at the site of mucosal priming compared to that of distant mucosal sites [110] . Nevertheless, the role of IgA should not be overemphasized in the discussion of respiratory immunity since T cell responses are of prominent importance in initiating local immune responses in the lung and induction of cytotoxic T cell responses are necessary for elimination of viral and bacterial infections [111] [112] [113] .\r\n The BALT was first described as follicular aggregates in the bronchial wall of rabbits. It is located mainly at branching sites such as the bifurcations of the bronchial tree. It was found that the respiratory epithelium overlaying the bronchial lymphoid structures contains M cells that are flattened and devoid of cilia [114] [115] [116] [117] . The BALT shows high variability between species and although constitutive structures are seen in rabbits and rats, this is not the case in humans [118, 119] . Studies of human BALT showed that BALT is not a constitutive structure in lungs of healthy adults and BALT observed in younger adults (until the age of 20) consists of smaller follicles than those described, e.g. in rabbits [120, 121] . It was previously discussed that detection of BALT in the human adult lung is associated with infection or inflammation [121] . Moyron-Quiroz et al. [122] had shown that influenza infection resulted in the formation of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in mice lacking lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes and Peyer's patches). The iBALT was capable of priming influenzaspecific T and B cells that were able to clear the virus and facilitate host survival. Although iBALT resembles constitutive BALT, it is not induced by an antigenindependent developmental pathway, its size varies widely and it can be found in different pulmonary compartments than the constitutive BALT [122] . These findings point out that although constitutive BALT is not found in human adults, this tissue can be induced by local infection. However, observations in animal models may not directly be extrapolated to the human situation.\r\n The concept of DNA vaccines arose from the observation that intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA containing reporter genes resulted in protein expression in the muscle that could be detected even 2 months after injection [123] . Hence, it was suggested that administration of a plasmid DNA encoding an antigenic protein could result in the in situ expression of the antigen, followed by antigen-specific immunity. In the following years, many plasmid DNA vectors encoding different bacterial, viral, parasitic and cancer antigens were constructed and tested for their immunogenicity and protective efficacy in animal models and primates [124] [125] [126] . Recently it was also suggested that these vaccines can serve not only for prevention purposes but also as therapeutic vaccines in chronic infections where they might restore immune control and prevent severe complication of the disease [127] .\r\n DNA vaccines hold many distinct advantages in comparison to recombinant proteins or inactivated pathogens: (I) The production is easy and similar between different plasmids, making up-scaling more simple and economical. (II) The DNA is stable at higher temperatures, a property increasing shelf-life and facilitating transport and distribution of such vaccines [128] . (III) Different antigens can be encoded in the same vector, leading to expression of multiple antigenic proteins in one vaccination. And finally (IV) these vaccines have the advantage of inducing a strong cellular immunity with a preference to cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and T helper type 1 (Th1) T cell responses.\r\n Although the immunological benefits of DNA vaccines are well established, three safety issues were evaluated in preclinical animal models and have to be evaluated in DNA vaccination studies. The main safety issue is the risk of chromosomal integration into the host genome that might result in activation of oncogenes or disruption of tumor suppressor genes. The theoretical chance of an integration event is low and in mice there was no evidence of integration at a sensitivity level of 1-7.5 integrations in 150,000 nuclei, which was calculated to be 3 orders of magnitude lower than the spontaneous mutation frequency [129] . Nevertheless, this safety concern needs to be addressed in future clinical trials to assure the same result in human subjects. The second safety issue is the possibility of plasmid DNA to elicit anti-DNA antibodies. However, no anti-DNA antibodies were detected in sera from immunized mice and it was suggested that proper purification from E. coli would most likely prevent pathogenic anti-DNA antibody production [130, 131] . The third safety concern is the development of tolerance to the encoded antigen. This issue will need to be addressed in the context of the age of the vaccinated individual since there is a high chance of inducing tolerance by immunizing newborns with an immature immune system [126, 131] .\r\n Today we have the possibility to sequence the complete genomes of pathogens in a relatively short period of time and to identify most antigens of a pathogen and test its ability to induce immunity. This new genomebased approach to vaccine development was termed breverse vaccinologyQ [132] . This approach enables prediction of new potential antigens and their testing much faster in comparison to conventional vaccinology. The most recent example was the SARS virus where the viral genome was sequenced 1 month after it was first suggested that a coronavirus was involved in the disease [133] . This approach will undeniably increase the amount of potential new DNA vaccines against pathogens causing a wide range of diseases.\r\n Plasmid vectors intended for use as DNA vaccines need to have certain essential elements (Fig. 4) : (I) a bacterial backbone with an origin of replication (ORI) (usually from E. coli) that facilitates amplification of large quantities of DNA for purification. Obviously, this should not be active in mammalian cells in vivo in order to reduce the possibility of plasmid integration into the host genome. (II) A prokaryotic marker gene such as an antibiotic resistance gene to facilitate selection of organisms carrying the plasmid. (III) A strong eukaryotic promoter to drive the expression of the antigenic gene (usually from cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Simian virus 40 (SV40)). (IV) A transcription terminator to ensure that the mRNA is appropriately terminated, such as polyA signal from bovine growth hormone (BGH). (V) DNA sequence encoding the antigen of interest. (VI) The addition of a mammalian signal sequence may be desirable to facilitate protein secretion that may be required for efficient antibody production or presentation by MHC class II molecules [1, 131, 134] .\r\n DNA immunization results in antigen expression in vivo and generation of both humoral and cellular immune responses. The major advantage of DNA vaccines is their ability to generate MHC class Irestricted CTL responses. This was demonstrated by intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA encoding influenza A nucleoprotein [135] , HIV Gag and Env antigens [136] [137] [138] , hepatitis B virus surface and core antigens [139, 140] , M. tuberculosis antigen 85A and heat shock protein 65 [141, 142] , among others. Activation of CTLs after DNA immunization can occur in two ways: (I) by APCs that were directly transfected by the DNA; (II) by cross-priming, in which non-APCs initially produce the protein encoded by the DNA vaccine and then deliver the antigen to a professional APC for priming of MHC class I restricted CTL responses. Although non-APCs (e.g. myocytes) take up and produce protein more than other cell types after DNA administration, they usually lack the costimulatory signals needed for the CTL activation process [143] [144] [145] . In the case of type II alveolar cells, it was shown they are able to express co-stimulatory molecules and deliver co-stimulatory signals to T cells therefore present an additional mechanism for activating CTL responses in the lung (Fig. 5 ) [21] .\r\n Intramuscular DNA vaccination can further initiate T helper responses. Bacterial plasmid DNA contains unmethylated CpG motifs that are not prevalent in vertebrate genomic DNA and are able to stimulate APCs via TLR9. These CpG motifs can trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12, and therefore, the generation of Th1 responses may be a general property of DNA vaccines. Nevertheless, the route of vaccination and the vaccine carrier has a pronounced effect on the nature of the immune response elicited (reviewed in [146] ). As an example, the application of DNA vaccines by dgene gunT resulted in a Th2 biased response. The gene gun application system uses vaccine coated gold particles that are introduced intradermally by ballistic action. It was shown that the Th2 response was a result of the mode of application and not a result of the different site of vaccination (skin vs. muscle). A possible explanation is that the gene gun delivers the DNA directly into the cells, bypassing the surface interaction of APCs with the CpG motifs. The ability of DNA vaccines to preferentially induce Th1 responses may be particularly important for preventing intracellular infections that require Th1 immunity to optimize the pathogen's eradication [124, 125] .\r\n DNA immunization was shown to induce strong humoral immune responses to a wide variety of antigens in animals and in human subjects. The antibody response is increased in a dose-response manner, however, once the optimal dose is given, a plateau in the antibody response is reached, and no significant effect is achieved after increasing the dose further or giving multiple injections. Since DNA vaccination generally Fig. 4 . Schematic representation of a DNA vaccine. Plasmid constructs intended for immunization are bacterially derived and contain the genetic sequence of a desired antigen. The vector requires a strong bacterial origin of replication, an antibiotic selection marker, a strong eukaryotic promoter (usually a strong viral promoter like pCMV) and a transcription terminator. Fig. 5 . CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) activation mechanisms after pulmonary DNA immunization. Type II alveolar cells were found to express co-stimulatory molecules and were able to deliver co-stimulatory signals to T cells, therefore could lead to CTL activation (a). The other CTL activation mechanisms involve direct transduction of professional APCs after DNA immunization (b) and cross-priming, where the respiratory epithelium is transfected, produces the antigen and then transfer it to professional APCs, which are directly responsible for activation of CTL responses (c). enhances Th1 cytokine production, the subclass of antibodies generated will be biased toward IgG2a production. Also, as was seen for the T helper responses, the route of DNA vaccination can bias toward IgG1 production (gene gun). In some cases, antibodies have contributed to protection against challenge with the relevant pathogen, indicating that the antigens could generate neutralizing antibodies [124, 125] .\r\n Many antigens from pulmonary pathogens were identified as candidate vaccines by genome-based or classical approaches. The corresponding DNA vaccines were synthesized and evaluated for immunogenicity and protective efficacy. In the following section we discuss the possible benefits of pulmonary vaccination for three pathogens causing severe diseases in the airways: M. tuberculosis, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\r\n One third of the world population is infected with the M. tuberculosis bacillus [147] . Only 5-10% of the infected people develop an active disease during their lifetime since in normal healthy persons, the immune system is able to control the disease. However, the bacilli can stay dormant in the body and in an immunosuppressed state, the chances of developing an active disease increase. The disease is spread by individuals with active pulmonary tuberculosis by air. If left untreated, a sick person infects on average 10-15 people every year by creating aerosol droplets containing the bacilli (by coughing, sneezing etc.). Overall, 2 million people die every year from tuberculosis. A relieve of this situation seems far-off, especially with the emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and the deadly combination of AIDS and tuberculosis [147, 148] . The bStop TB initiativeQ is a world-embracing program that is committed to diagnosis, treatment and future prevention of tuberculosis. Using the Directly Observed Therapy Short-course program (DOTS; an internationally recommended TB control strategy), tuberculosis is better controlled in different areas in the world, however, it is clear that without immunization it will be difficult to stop the transmission of the disease [149, 150] . A preventative vaccine will best control a disease like this, however, the only vaccine available for tuberculosis is the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis that was shown to have a protective effect against meningeal tuberculosis in children. However, the BCG fails to prevent pulmonary tuberculosis in adults [151] . Many efforts are directed at finding new candidate vaccines which will provide broad protection against disease and infection, induce lifelong immunological memory, would be safe, stable and inexpensive [149, 152] .\r\n Mycobacterial infections require cell-mediated immunity and both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are essential for optimal responses. Since DNA vaccines can induce strong cellular immunity, many preclinical studies were performed using different encoding antigens [153] . The first reports of DNA vaccines against tuberculosis showing immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice were performed using the antigen 85A (Ag85A) and 65 kDa heat shock protein (hsp65) from M. tuberculosis [141, 142] . Many other antigens such as ESAT-6 [154] [155] [156] , Mtb 8.4 [157] , 19 kDa lipoptotein [158, 159] , MPT64 [155, 156] , Ag85B [155, 160] , putative phosphate transport receptors (PstS) [161, 162] and more [153] were also studied and provided different degrees of immunogenicity and protection. Most of these vaccines encode mycobacterial proteins that are secreted in mycobacterial culture filtrate or are exposed on the mycobacterial cell-wall surface. The availability of the complete M. tuberculosis genome [163] makes tuberculosis DNA vaccines popular for research since open reading frames (ORF) presenting potential antigens can be immediately used without the need to express and purify the protein. The general belief is that a successful tuberculosis DNA or protein vaccine will require a bcocktailQ of immunogens [164] .\r\n RSV is the most common cause of severe respiratory disease in infants, leading to hospitalization of 2% of children in their first year of life. It accounts for approximately 70% of all cases of viral bronchiolitis in infants, and causes the highest morbidity in infants 2-4 months old. The disease is transmitted by respiratory secretions and by direct contact with contaminated surfaces [165] [166] [167] . Re-infection with RSV is common during life, however, it results in mild courses of upper respiratory tract infection and is life threatening only in cases of immunocompromised individuals.\r\n A complete immune response to RSV includes antibody production, helper T cell response and CD8+ CTLs. Although antibodies to most RSV proteins will be generated in RSV infection, protection is incomplete and re-infection is possible even in the presence of high levels of virus neutralizing antibodies. Nevertheless, local antibodies in the respiratory tract were found to be related to protection: neutralizing antibodies were found to correlate with relative protection and local production of IgA concurs with virus clearance. Maternal antibodies appear to protect newborns against infection, however, their concentration decreases during the first 6 months of life where the disease peaks in infants. RSV infection is associated with a balanced type 1 and type 2 T helper response that is important for coordination of protective and immunopathogenic responses [166, 167] . The promise that DNA vaccines hold for preventing RSV is that the encoded antigen might be expressed for prolonged periods of time, immunizing the infant at the appropriate time point when the maternal antibodies concentration decreases under protection levels [168] . Most of the vaccination studies so far were performed in rodents and focused on two glycoproteins that are localized on the surface of the virus. The F protein is responsible for fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane and is highly conserved between RSV subtypes while the G protein mediates attachment to the host cell surface and is responsible for the antigenic diversity between the RSV subtypes. DNA vaccines encoding RSV-G protein induced balanced systemic and pulmonary Th1\/Th2 responses, neutralizing antibodies and protection against RSV infection of the lower respiratory tract of both mice and rats [169, 170] . RSV-F protein encoding vector showed to induce high neutralizing antibodies titers, CTL responses, protection against intranasal challenge of live RSV and high IFN-g expression in the lungs after challenge [171] . Furthermore, it was shown that addition of CD40 ligand to DNA vaccines encoding RSV-F and G antigens can enhance viral clearance and some parameters of the immune response to RSV challenge [172] .\r\n The SARS outbreak of an atypical pneumonia was first reported in the Guangdong Province in the south of China in November 2002. By July 2003, WHO had recorded over 8000 cases of SARS worldwide and more than 800 deaths [173, 174] . Viral isolation and serological assays confirmed that SARS-CoV was the primary infectious agent, its genome was sequenced and it was defined as a new coronavirus that is not a member of any of the three coronavirus groups known so far [175, 176] . The route of transmission has not been completely established yet, but it was immediately observed that health-care workers in close contact with SARS patients are at high risk, probably as a result of aerosol-generating procedures [177] [178] [179] . Airborne transmission seems possible and supported by a case of community SARS outbreak in a Hong Kong housing complex and the observation that a face mask is the most efficient precaution for medical staff protection [180] . There is a need for better understanding of the exact transmission mechanism by droplets and a definition whether SARS is obligatory, preferentially or opportunistically airborne transmitted [181] .\r\n Although SARS emerged only 2 years ago, data concerning vaccine candidates are already starting to accumulate. The most promising vaccine candidates are the two structural proteins: the nucleocapside protein (N) and the spike protein (S). It was shown that 89% of a group of patients with SARS produced antibodies to the N protein while less than 63% produced antibodies to the S protein [182] . In another study using neutralization assay with pseudotype virus, it was shown that SARS-CoV elicited a strong humoral neutralizing response to the S protein [183] . Many efforts are directed at finding specific domains and epitopes of the S protein that will induce strong production of anti SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and will advance the development of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS [184] [185] [186] [187] . DNA vaccine encoding the S protein of the SARS-CoV induces neutralizing antibodies, T cell response and protective immunity in mice. The protection mechanism was not dependent on T cell immunity since T cell depletion did not affect vaccine-induced protection and furthermore, adoptive T cell transfer did not reduce pulmonary viral replication in the recipient animals. In contrast, passive transfer of purified IgG from immunized mice provided protection similar to that observed after DNA vaccination [188] . DNA immunization using N protein encoding plasmid resulted in specific anti-N antibodies and specific CTL response [189, 190] . Since in some models it was shown that only the S protein was protective [191] , future experiments should detect the best vaccine candidate or prove that a combination of these structural antigens will induce the best viral protection.\r\n Mucosal immunization is a promising and rational strategy to combat infectious agents that enter the body via mucosal surfaces. The site of antigen encounter will determine the immune response and circulating antigen-specific T cells that are primed in a mucosal tissue have increased homing commitment to the original mucosal site [192] . Furthermore, vaccination at one mucosal inductive site can induce immune responses in distant effector mucosal sites in the common mucosal immune system after secondary exposure to the antigen [193] . Therefore, the lung should be the preferred vaccination site for pathogens entering the body via the airways and inducing pulmonary disease.\r\n Most of the pulmonary immunization strategies described to date involve nasal application due to the ease of administration and the belief that this vaccination site can stimulate respiratory mucosal immunity by interacting with the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). Although it can induce both local and systemic immune responses, the main mucosal effect remains in the upper airways, which may lead to insufficient respiratory immunity against pulmonary pathogens. Using a murine model of respiratory reovirus infection it was shown that stimulation of NALT alone did not induce an optimal antibody response and effective immunity was only achieved by a combination of upper and lower respiratory tract infection [194] . A combined approach using intranasal and intratracheal administration simultaneously was recently used in African green monkeys where an attenuated parainfluenza virus expressing the SARS coronavirus spike protein was administered once and induced detectable neutralising antibodies against SARS coronavirus in serum [195] . Furthermore, a comparison between upper respiratory tract immunization (intrana-sal) and lower respiratory tract immunization (intratracheal) using inactivated influenza virus and a prototype split-subunit vaccine showed that intratracheal immunization was more effective in inducing local and systemic immune responses [196] . Another comparison between intratracheal, intranasal and intramuscular delivery of microencapsulated mixed Yersinia pestis subunit vaccines (V and F1 subunits) showed that intratracheal immunization resulted in higher immune responses in the respiratory tract, dominated by local IgG to both antigens [197] .\r\n Inhaled vaccines are poorly investigated so far despite reported success in several disease models. Efficient immune responses were demonstrated for tuberculosis [198] [199] [200] [201] , measles [202] and influenza [203] emphasizing the great potential of deep lung immunization for prevention of pulmonary infections. The measles vaccine is the most explored for pulmonary administration. The WHO has been focusing on the development of aerosol measles vaccine for several years and is supporting efforts to change the administration route of the vaccine [204] . The main reasons for this are the ability for mass vaccination campaigns, the possible administration by non-medical personnel and most importantly, the ability to eliminate transmission of diseases like HIV, hepatitis B and other blood-borne pathogens by poor practice of injection safety procedures. Dry powder formulations of measles vaccine for pulmonary aerosol delivery appear to be a viable approach, retaining the vaccine's potency and eliminating the cold chain requirement during immunization [205, 206] . Future studies with other vaccines aiming to eradicate respiratory diseases are needed to compare current application methods for vaccines with the pulmonary route.\r\n Although a promising approach, pulmonary immunization presents several disadvantages. The first disadvantage is the possibility of hypersensitivity responses to the vaccine preparation. Therefore, immunization studies should check specific immune responses to the vaccine and determine local hypersensitivity responses or lung pathologies that resulted from the vaccine and\/or its formulation. Another immunological concern in pulmonary immunization is the development of mucosal tolerance as a response to antigen deposition in the lung. It was established that soluble antigens delivered to the respiratory mucosa without inflammatory signals or sensitised T cells, induced tolerance after systemic challenge [207] . Finally, a practical disadvantage is the small volume of liquid-formulations that can be applied in small animal models, especially in mice that are the best immunologically characterized animal serving as model for many investigated diseases. This argument, however, may be mute in the case of vaccines given as dry powder formulations.\r\n Pulmonary mucosal immunization employing DNA vaccines is a rather new, yet in our opinion promising vaccination approach, presenting many appealing properties. In addition to the practical issues mentioned above for mucosal vaccine delivery in general, this approach will enable vaccination of immunocompromised individuals since there is no threat of virulence as encountered by live attenuated vaccines [208] . Inhalation of DNA vaccines was recently described using plasmids encoding ovalbumin, hepatitis B surface antigen [209] and HLA-A*0201restricted T-cell epitopes of M. tuberculosis [210] and were shown to increase immunity as measured by antibodies and cytokine production. It was suggested that the immune response is highly dependent on the encoded antigen and it should be further investigated whether this application method holds an advantage in comparison to the common vaccination procedure by intramuscular injection. Furthermore, the mechanism of immune induction should be explored with an emphasis on the interaction of the antigens with pulmonary DCs, DCs migration to other lymphoid organs and the migration of immune cells to the lung after pulmonary immunization. The role of the BALT as a part of the CMIS should also be defined in the context of pulmonary DNA vaccination in order to clarify whether the lung can influence immunity in other mucosal effectors sites. Since IgA is not always present in broncho-alveolar lavage [209] , its role in pulmonary immunity and disease protection should be elucidated.\r\n The goals of DNA delivery systems are to achieve long-term expression of the antigen encoded in the DNA vaccine, protect DNA from enzymatic degrada-tion and enhance the immune response. Although DNA vaccines showed good potency in preclinical animal models, results in primates and in ensuing phase I clinical trials in humans were disappointing [211] , emphasizing the need to develop delivery applications and strategies to increase the immune response (reviewed in [146] ).\r\n DNA carriers are categorized into two groups: viral and non-viral vectors. Each group presents different characteristics and has its own advantages and drawbacks.\r\n Viruses are appealing vectors because of their natural ability to incorporate DNA into the host genome. In order to deliver DNA for therapeutic purposes, viral carriers were modified to eliminate induction of pathogenic effects and ensure safe transgene expression. The main disadvantage of viral vectors is that they are detected by the immune system and induce an immune response directed against them. This does not allow application of repeated doses, which are usually needed for gene therapy and genetic immunization [212, 213] . Viral DNA vaccine delivery research was performed mainly with adenoviruses and poxviruses (vaccinia viruses).\r\n Replication-incompetent adenoviral vectors expressing HIV antigens were shown to be efficient in inducing humoral and cellular immune responses. Best results were usually achieved by DNA vaccine priming and adenoviral boost [214] . Intranasal immunization with adenoviral vectors induced greater mucosal IgA responses against HIV antigens and recombinant adenovirus expressing Ag85A of M. tuberculosis provided potent protection in a tuberculosis challenge model after intranasal administration [215, 216] . However, detection of infection in the central nervous system could limit the utility of this route of delivery of adenoviral vectors [215] .\r\n Highly attenuated vaccinia viral vectors (modified vaccinia Ankara; MVA) were used for HIV antigens [217] , multi-epitope construct derived from Plasmodium falciparum antigens [218] , cancer-associated antigens [219] and Ag85A of M. tuberculosis [220] . These vectors presented the highest immunogenicity when given as a booster dose and induced efficient protection against challenge in animal models. MVA vectors carrying cancer and P. falciparum antigens presented no serious adverse effect in clinical trials with human subjects [218, 219] .\r\n Although non-viral vectors does not present the disadvantages demonstrated by viral vectors, they are less efficient in inducing high transgene expression levels. These carriers can encapsulate, complex or adsorb the DNA when complexation and adsorption are usually based on electrostatic forces between negatively charged DNA and positively charged carrier. The carriers are usually able to protect the DNA from nuclease degradation and, depending on the system, present controlled release profiles. These carriers can vary considerably, integrating targeting moieties, endosomal disruptive agents and nuclear localization signals in order to improve tissue targeting and intracellular delivery (Fig. 6) [221, 222] . Essential qualities of the delivery systems are biocompatibility to enable multiple administrations, low toxicity and efficient gene delivery so sufficient levels of antigen will be produced to result in a protective immune response.\r\n Most of the described synthetic vectors for DNA vaccine delivery are lipid or polymer based. 4.3.2.1. Lipid-based DNA delivery systems. Lipidbased delivery systems are cationic lipids with a positive charge that is pH independent. Positively charged lipids interact with negatively charged DNA to form complexes [223] . In lipid-based formulations, DNA can be complexed to the cationic moieties or entrapped within the aqueous phase of liposomes by a dehydration-rehydration procedure [224] . Liposomal complexes (lipoplexes) were evaluated with M. tuberculosis and anthrax encoded antigens and were shown to improve immunogenicity and protective efficacy [225, 226] . Mannosylated liposomes were synthesized to target APCs in vivo and enhanced the immune response after complexation of plasmid encoding the model antigen, ovalbumin [227] . Entrapment of DNA into the aqueous compartment of the liposomes was shown to be more effective than complexation and resulted in better immune responses against hepatitis B surface antigen [224, 228] . It is assumed that lipo- Fig. 6 . Schematic illustration of the internalization and intracellular trafficking of plasmid DNA delivered in a non-viral carrier system. somes improve immunogenicity of DNA vaccines by facilitating uptake by APCs [229] .\r\n Emulsions are another delivery system derived from lipids that could deliver DNA vaccines efficiently. The surface charge of an oil-in-water (O\/W) submicron emulsion, based on the potent squalene adjuvant MF59, was cationized using 1, 2-Dioleoyl-3-methylammonium-propane (DOTAP). Immunization with a DNA vaccine encoding HIV Gag protein adsorbed to the positively charged emulsion resulted in significantly enhanced immune responses in mice and in rabbits [230] .\r\n Polymer-based DNA delivery systems. These systems include various polymers that are positively charged at physiological pH to be able to complex DNA. Naturally and synthetically derived polymers can be manipulated by chemical modifications to achieve cell targeting and higher transfection efficiency [231] . Some qualities that are of major importance for future use in humans are biocompatibility, biodegradability and low toxicity.\r\n Chitosan is the deacetylated form of the naturally originated polysaccharide, chitin, and has been extensively explored as a pharmaceutical excipient and as a delivery vehicle [232] . Chitosan polymers can vary in their molecular weight, viscosity and degree of deacetylation. The solubility of chitosan is highly dependent on the degree of deacetylation and the pH. In pH values lower than 6.5 chitosan is positively charged and is able to form complexes with anions (Fig. 7a) . It is biodegradable, biocompatible and presents an excellent toxicity profile. Furthermore, chitosan was shown to be mucoadhesive and enhance mucosal absorption by opening tight junctions, therefore it is favourable for vaccine delivery into mucosal tissues. Oral delivery of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with DNA encoding peanut allergy antigen generated protective immunity [233] . Additionally, these nanoparticles enhanced immune responses when given intranasally with a cocktail of plasmid DNAs encoding RSV antigens [234] and a lyophilized formulation of DNA encoding a CTL epitope from M2 protein of RSV complexed to chitosan induced significant reduction of viral load in lungs of intranasally immunized mice [235] . Oral delivery of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with DNA encoding GRA1 protein of Toxoplasma gondii presented enhanced immunogenicity [236] . These studies point out chitosan as an efficient carrier for DNA vaccines.\r\n Polyethyleneimines (PEI) are polymers of various molecular weights with the highest cationic charge density potential where every third atom is an amine group that can be protonated (Fig. 7b) . These polymers were first shown to be efficient gene delivery systems in 1995 [237] . DNA encoding human growth hormone (hGH) and complexed to PEI induced high levels of antibodies after a single administration [238] . Gene expression analysis demonstrated that PEI is able to activate the immune system without DNA and activates genes involved in cellular processes like cell-cycle regulation, oncogenesis and differentiation [239] . This evidence suggests careful monitoring of toxic effects when immunizing with PEIs.\r\n Poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymers are one of the most commonly investigated materials for delivery of therapeutics (Fig. 7c) . They are biocompatible, biodegradable and present low toxicity [240] . PLGA microparticles and nanoparticles were described to efficiently encapsulate plasmid DNA [241, 242] . Encapsulated DNA plasmid in PLGA microparticles was shown to elicit protective immune responses against tumors [243] and stimulate durable T cell responses to tumor-associated antigen cytochrome P450 1B1 [244] . Release of DNA was improved by addition of poly-h amino ester to the PLGA microparticles and enhanced antigen-specific rejection of tumor cells in vivo compared to conventional PLGA microparticles [245] . Cationic PLGA microparticles were designed to enable adsorption of DNA to the surface instead of encapsulation [246] . PLGA microparticles bearing the cationic agent cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) enhanced immune responses to HIV-1 Gag protein after intramuscular and intranasal administration in mice [230, 247] . Potent responses were also achieved for DNA encoding E1E2 envelope proteins of hepatitis C virus [248] . These delivery systems are currently evaluated in clinical trials with genetic vaccines and immunotherapeutic agents (DNA encoding HPV antigenic epitopes encapsulated in PLGA microparticles, Zycos\/MGI Pharma, http:\/\/ www.zycos.com; DNA encoding HIV clade B Gag and Env antigens adsorbed to PLGA microparticles, NIAID, http:\/\/www.aidsinfo.nih.gov\/clinical _ trials).\r\n Pulmonary delivery of DNA vaccines using carrier systems is rarely explored and most of the existing data describes optimization of formulations for aerosol gene delivery and evaluates gene expression in the lungs [249] [250] [251] [252] [253] [254] [255] [256] . In addition to inducing transfection of cells in vitro and lung tissue in vivo, carriers for pulmonary genetic vaccine delivery will have to be explored with DNA encoding pulmonary antigens in the relevant animal models and prove immunogenicity and protective efficacy. In vivo results regarding immunogenicity in the lung after pulmonary administration of DNA with a carrier system exist only for PEI-DNA polyplexes [238] and chitosan nanoparticles [210] . Further development of pulmonary compatible formulations and novel delivery systems for DNA vaccines will enable prevention of life-threatening diseases caused by respiratory pathogens.\r\n In this era where new pathogens are genetically sequenced in a few months and their antigenic moieties can be detected quickly, DNA vaccines constitute a promising next generation of protective agents against life-threatening viruses and bacteria. Pulmonary DNA vaccination holds a promise for inducing local and systemic immune responses and should promote protection against inhaled airborne pathogens. In this review we presented the potential of the lung as a vaccination site that is specialized in antigen sampling and initiation of immunity using its epithelial cells, immune cells and local lymphoid tissue. Further evaluation of DNA vaccines against airborne pathogens is needed to determine their protective efficacy. In addition, new non-toxic pulmonary adjuvants and delivery systems should be characterized and investigated in vivo. In order to perform challenge studies where airborne pathogens are given as an aerosol, collaborative work with the appropriate biohazard facilities authorized to execute such experiments will be beneficial and enable the researchers to study the full potential of pulmonary applied vaccines.","sha":"36eaec58a5d37602d2932074f554858a22acdfe3","publish_time":"2005-09-20","authors":"Bivas-Benita, Maytal; Ottenhoff, Tom H.M.; Junginger, Hans E.; Borchard, Gerrit","journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","doi":"10.1016\/j.jconrel.2005.05.028","Title":"Journal of Controlled Release","H index":237.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Mucosal vaccine delivery embraces appealing characteristics for new immunization strategies against invading pathogens. The pulmonary epithelium itself has a crucial role in host defence against inhaled pathogens since it presents a physical barrier including the mucociliary escalator, which in concert with the secreted antimicrobial agents that are present in the mucus layer covering the airway epithelium prevents colonization of microorganisms. Organized lymphoid follicles, known as the broncho-alveolar lymphoid tissue (BALT) and local antigen-presenting cells (APCs) located ideally to sample antigens entering the airways are found in the lung. DNA vaccines constitute an exciting new approach in vaccine development. The vaccine construct is created by insertion of a DNA encoding the desired antigen into a bacterial plasmid vector. The extent to which the plasmid DNA is able to transfect cells is dependent on the application route and the delivery system used. We describe the major features of pulmonary immunology and give an overview of DNA vaccines in general and in association with pulmonary pathologies. In addition, we discuss the main work performed so far in the field of pulmonary DNA vaccine delivery and argue that direct vaccine application to the lower respiratory tract will be beneficial in protecting against inhaled pathogens causing life-threatening diseases. Further branching from the bronchi are the bronchioles, terminal bronchioles and in the further branching of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli where the exchange of oxygen and CO 2 with the blood occurs [2] . In the more distal airways the epithelium becomes less multilayered, glands are less frequent and cells become less columnar. The cells lining the upper and lower respiratory tract were shown to produce a variety of molecules that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses [3] [4] [5] [6] . Chemotactic agents are induced in response to a variety of stimuli and recruit inflammatory cells to the lung. Important inflammatory mediators that were shown to play an important role in pulmonary host defence include the cytokines TNF-a, IL-12, IL-10, interferon gamma (IFN-g) and GM-CSF. Lung injury may result in cytokine leakage to the circulation and a systemic cytokine response [4] [5] [6] . Pulmonary epithelial cells can act as antigenpresenting and immunoregulatory cells of the lung. By contrast, in addition to MHC class II molecules, type II alveolar epithelial cells can also express co-stimulatory molecules and these are able to deliver co-stimulatory signals to T cells [21] . Phagocytic cells like macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) are essential for protection against inhaled pathogens. Macrophages are a versatile population of cells that have many functions in the human body. Pulmonary macrophages are bone marrow derived cells that differentiate from blood monocytes after migrating to the lung. Macrophages are an essential element of human innate immunity to inhaled pathogens. Scavenger receptors (SRs) and CD14 on macrophage cell surfaces are associated with phagocytosis of apoptotic cells [27] , and pattern-recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are associated with macrophage stimulation after ligation by their microbial ligands [28] . The success of this non-specific pathogen elimination process is dependent on the pathogen type and load. The macrophage's ability to eliminate a specific pathogen is also dependent on the microorganism's species. The decreased susceptibility to infection by these pathogens could be due to interference with TLR and IFN-g-mediated activation pathways in macrophages [29, 30] . Macrophages also have a regulatory function in acquired immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) are a part of the innate defence system and are initiators and modulators for specific and non-specific immunity. DCs originate from bone marrow haematopoietic stem cells. The last two mechanisms are extremely efficient in antigen sampling and require very small concentrations of the antigen in order to activate DCs. Upon stimulation, immature DCs capture the antigen, migrate to the draining lymphoid organs and differentiate into mature DCs. Maturation of DCs results in a decreased capacity to take up antigens and increased presentation capabilities. Local antigenic challenge will result in higher density of DCs in the airways and increased expression of activation markers [45, 46] . These subsets differ in their phenotype, localization and function. It is clear by now that several factors control the T helper balance of the immune response initiated by DCs: the DC lineage (DC1\/DC2), the maturation signal and the inflammatory mediators present in the microenvironment [61] [62] [63] [64] . The bdefaultQ T helper response at mucosal surfaces is Th2, which might be due to an inherent property of the resident DC and macrophage populations. Not all TLRs are expressed on the cell surface, a feature that is in accordance with the nature of the different TLRs ligands. LPS is present in the cell wall of the pathogen and is therefore recognized upon first contact with the host cell by TLR4 located on the cell surface. Higher levels of TLR mRNA were shown to be expressed in tissues that are exposed to the external environment like the lung and the gastrointestinal tract, as well as at immunologically active sites such as peripheral blood leukocytes and the spleen [87] . Different cells can show distinct sets of TLR expression leading to differences in the reactivity to microbial molecules. Recently, expression of all known TLRs was reported in an airway epithelial cell line and in primary bronchial epithelial cells, however, TLRs 2, 3, 5 and 6 were the most highly expressed [91] . In bacterial infection, TLR4 is associated with recognition of gramnegative bacterial LPS while TLR2 has the capacity to recognize major cell-wall constituents of gram-positive bacteria. A point of debate is to which extent TLR2 and TLR4 are involved in antibacterial host defence, and contradictory in vivo results were obtained, likely due to differences in the bacterial challenge models [96] [97] [98] [99] . It is a secondary lymphoid tissue comprised of non-encapsulated accumulation of lymphoid tissue. Stimulation by an antigen will result in generation of secretory IgA antibodies, which are able to cross epithelial membranes and help in the prevention of future entry of pathogens through the mucosal site. It is located mainly at branching sites such as the bifurcations of the bronchial tree. The iBALT was capable of priming influenzaspecific T and B cells that were able to clear the virus and facilitate host survival. These findings point out that although constitutive BALT is not found in human adults, this tissue can be induced by local infection. However, observations in animal models may not directly be extrapolated to the human situation. Recently it was also suggested that these vaccines can serve not only for prevention purposes but also as therapeutic vaccines in chronic infections where they might restore immune control and prevent severe complication of the disease [127] . II) The DNA is stable at higher temperatures, a property increasing shelf-life and facilitating transport and distribution of such vaccines [128] . ( The second safety issue is the possibility of plasmid DNA to elicit anti-DNA antibodies. Plasmid vectors intended for use as DNA vaccines need to have certain essential elements (Fig. 4) : (I) a bacterial backbone with an origin of replication (ORI) (usually from E. coli) that facilitates amplification of large quantities of DNA for purification. II) A prokaryotic marker gene such as an antibiotic resistance gene to facilitate selection of organisms carrying the plasmid. ( V) DNA sequence encoding the antigen of interest. ( The gene gun application system uses vaccine coated gold particles that are introduced intradermally by ballistic action. Schematic representation of a DNA vaccine. Plasmid constructs intended for immunization are bacterially derived and contain the genetic sequence of a desired antigen. Type II alveolar cells were found to express co-stimulatory molecules and were able to deliver co-stimulatory signals to T cells, therefore could lead to CTL activation (a). The other CTL activation mechanisms involve direct transduction of professional APCs after DNA immunization (b) and cross-priming, where the respiratory epithelium is transfected, produces the antigen and then transfer it to professional APCs, which are directly responsible for activation of CTL responses (c). The disease is spread by individuals with active pulmonary tuberculosis by air. Overall, 2 million people die every year from tuberculosis. Using the Directly Observed Therapy Short-course program (DOTS; an internationally recommended TB control strategy), tuberculosis is better controlled in different areas in the world, however, it is clear that without immunization it will be difficult to stop the transmission of the disease [149, 150] . Since DNA vaccines can induce strong cellular immunity, many preclinical studies were performed using different encoding antigens [153] . The first reports of DNA vaccines against tuberculosis showing immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice were performed using the antigen 85A (Ag85A) and 65 kDa heat shock protein (hsp65) from M. tuberculosis [141, 142] . Many other antigens such as ESAT-6 [154] [155] [156] , Mtb 8.4 [157] , 19 kDa lipoptotein [158, 159] , MPT64 [155, 156] , Ag85B [155, 160] , putative phosphate transport receptors (PstS) [161, 162] and more [153] were also studied and provided different degrees of immunogenicity and protection. Most of these vaccines encode mycobacterial proteins that are secreted in mycobacterial culture filtrate or are exposed on the mycobacterial cell-wall surface. RSV is the most common cause of severe respiratory disease in infants, leading to hospitalization of 2% of children in their first year of life. The promise that DNA vaccines hold for preventing RSV is that the encoded antigen might be expressed for prolonged periods of time, immunizing the infant at the appropriate time point when the maternal antibodies concentration decreases under protection levels [168] . The SARS outbreak of an atypical pneumonia was first reported in the Guangdong Province in the south of China in November 2002. Although SARS emerged only 2 years ago, data concerning vaccine candidates are already starting to accumulate. In another study using neutralization assay with pseudotype virus, it was shown that SARS-CoV elicited a strong humoral neutralizing response to the S protein [183] . Another comparison between intratracheal, intranasal and intramuscular delivery of microencapsulated mixed Yersinia pestis subunit vaccines (V and F1 subunits) showed that intratracheal immunization resulted in higher immune responses in the respiratory tract, dominated by local IgG to both antigens [197] . The measles vaccine is the most explored for pulmonary administration. Future studies with other vaccines aiming to eradicate respiratory diseases are needed to compare current application methods for vaccines with the pulmonary route. Therefore, immunization studies should check specific immune responses to the vaccine and determine local hypersensitivity responses or lung pathologies that resulted from the vaccine and\/or its formulation. Another immunological concern in pulmonary immunization is the development of mucosal tolerance as a response to antigen deposition in the lung. It was suggested that the immune response is highly dependent on the encoded antigen and it should be further investigated whether this application method holds an advantage in comparison to the common vaccination procedure by intramuscular injection. The role of the BALT as a part of the CMIS should also be defined in the context of pulmonary DNA vaccination in order to clarify whether the lung can influence immunity in other mucosal effectors sites. Since IgA is not always present in broncho-alveolar lavage [209] , its role in pulmonary immunity and disease protection should be elucidated. DNA carriers are categorized into two groups: viral and non-viral vectors. Each group presents different characteristics and has its own advantages and drawbacks. In order to deliver DNA for therapeutic purposes, viral carriers were modified to eliminate induction of pathogenic effects and ensure safe transgene expression. Most of the described synthetic vectors for DNA vaccine delivery are lipid or polymer based. Lipidbased delivery systems are cationic lipids with a positive charge that is pH independent. Emulsions are another delivery system derived from lipids that could deliver DNA vaccines efficiently. These systems include various polymers that are positively charged at physiological pH to be able to complex DNA. Chitosan polymers can vary in their molecular weight, viscosity and degree of deacetylation. It is biodegradable, biocompatible and presents an excellent toxicity profile. Additionally, these nanoparticles enhanced immune responses when given intranasally with a cocktail of plasmid DNAs encoding RSV antigens [234] and a lyophilized formulation of DNA encoding a CTL epitope from M2 protein of RSV complexed to chitosan induced significant reduction of viral load in lungs of intranasally immunized mice [235] . Polyethyleneimines (PEI) are polymers of various molecular weights with the highest cationic charge density potential where every third atom is an amine group that can be protonated (Fig. Poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymers are one of the most commonly investigated materials for delivery of therapeutics (Fig. Cationic PLGA microparticles were designed to enable adsorption of DNA to the surface instead of encapsulation [246] . In this era where new pathogens are genetically sequenced in a few months and their antigenic moieties can be detected quickly, DNA vaccines constitute a promising next generation of protective agents against life-threatening viruses and bacteria."},{"Unnamed: 0":55,"Unnamed: 0.1":55,"doc_id":"fe530f61e28057f70673651546c7ae571d2d984e","title":"Advax augments B and T cell responses upon influenza vaccination via the respiratory tract and enables complete protection of mice against lethal influenza virus challenge","abstract":"Administration of influenza vaccines via the respiratory tract has potential benefits over conventional parenteral administration, inducing immunity directly at the site of influenza exposure as well as being needle free. In this study, we investigated the suitability of Advax\u2122, a stable particulate polymorph of inulin, also referred to as delta inulin, as a mucosal adjuvant for whole inactivated influenza vaccine (WIV) administered either as a liquid or dry powder formulation. Spray freeze-drying produced Advax-adjuvanted WIV powder particles in a size range (1-5 \u03bcm) suitable for inhalation. The physical and biological characteristics of both WIV and Advax remained unaltered both by admixing WIV with Advax and by spray freeze drying. Upon intranasal or pulmonary immunization, both liquid and dry powder formulations containing Advax induced significantly higher systemic, mucosal and cellular immune responses than non-adjuvanted WIV formulations. Furthermore, pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV led to robust memory B cell responses along with an increase of lung localization factors i.e. CXCR3, CD69, and CD103. A less pronounced but still positive effect of Advax was seen on memory T cell responses. In contrast to animals immunized with WIV alone, all animals pulmonary immunized with a single dose of Advax-adjuvanted WIV were fully protected with no visible clinical symptoms against a lethal dose of influenza virus. These data confirm that Advax is a potent mucosal adjuvant that boosts vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses both in the lung and systemically with major positive effects on B-cell memory and complete protection against live virus. Hence, respiratory tract immunization, particularly via the lungs, with Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation as a liquid or dry powder is a promising alternative to parenteral influenza vaccination.","text_body":"Influenza is a highly contagious disease affecting millions of people worldwide on annual basis [1, 2] . Seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics of influenza are caused by the transmission of influenza virus via aerosols [3, 4] . Since the respiratory tract is the portal of influenza virus entry, in-theory the best means of protection would be to use a vaccine to generate a local memory immune response able to neutralize the virus at the site of infection. However, the majority of the currently available influenza vaccines are administered via intramuscular or subcutaneous injection [5] . Injected vaccines generate strong systemic immunity but minimal mucosal immunity [6, 7] . Moreover, injected vaccines can cause local reactions including pain, swelling and redness at the injection site, needle phobia, and transmission of infectious diseases due to needle stick injuries. An influenza vaccine formulation that could be administered via the respiratory tract would overcome these drawbacks of current injected formulations, is therefore needed. due to the live nature of the virus, it is not approved for use in high risk groups. This problem could be avoided by the use of inactivated influenza vaccine formulations suitable for delivery via the respiratory tract. Already in 1969, Waldman et al. reported that pulmonary vaccine administration was as effective as the conventional i.m. administration for preventing influenza associated illness [8] . Pulmonary vaccines can be delivered as liquids or as dry powders [6, 9, 10] . In pre-clinical studies, pulmonary delivery of both liquid and dry powder influenza vaccine formulations has shown to induce mucosal as well as systemic immune responses [6, 7, 11, 12] . However, the magnitude of immune responses evoked by these non-adjuvanted vaccines was low with low mucosal IgA titers and low numbers of memory cells; this might result in short lived protection against infection [7, 12, 13] . These issues might be solved by the use of a suitable adjuvant to boost the immune memory responses able to be elicited by respiratory tract administration of influenza vaccine.\r\n Identification of an adjuvant suitable for administration via the respiratory tract is not as easy as for parenteral administration, with no adjuvant currently approved for intranasal or pulmonary use in clinic. The problems of developing a mucosal adjuvant for influenza vaccines are highlighted by the issue of rare cases of facial palsy in clinical trial subjects who were administered an intranasal inactivated influenza vaccine containing a latent toxin adjuvant, resulting in the vaccine being abandoned [14] . Of current approved alternatives, alum, is not effective in influenza vaccines [15] , and in addition causes inflammasome activation, local cell necrosis with DNA release and forms insoluble aggregates rendering it unsuitable for pulmonary use [16, 17] . The only other currently approved influenza vaccine adjuvants are based on squalene oil emulsions, which are restricted to subcutaneous or intramuscular use. Moreover, the administration of oil-based emulsions to the respiratory tract are most likely detrimental for the normal balance of the alveolar lining fluid; thus interfering with lung function. Newer experimental adjuvants such as toll-like receptor agonists work via activation of NF\u03baB. However, NF\u03baB is a key inducer of inflammatory responses, and therefore pulmonary administration of these agonists may induce unacceptable lung inflammation [18] . Hence, the number of candidate adjuvants likely to be suitable for respiratory tract use is very limited.\r\n An adjuvant that has shown a good safety and tolerability record upon parenteral administration with inactivated and recombinant influenza vaccines in animal models and clinical trials is Advax [19] [20] [21] . Advax adjuvant is composed of the insoluble particulate polymorph of inulin, also referred to as delta inulin. The inulin that makes up Advax adjuvant is rapidly excreted from the body through renal excretion with complete clearance within approximately 3 weeks after parenteral administration [22] . Advax adjuvant comprises discoidal shape particles of 1-2 \u03bcm in diameter, formed by assembly of a series of lamellar crystalline sheets [23] . Adjuvantation of parenterally administered vaccines with Advax has shown to improve the immunogenicity and protective capacity of several vaccine candidates against hepatitis B, anthrax, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, listeria and influenza [21, [24] [25] [26] [27] . The exact mechanism by which Advax boosts immune responses upon parenteral administration is still under investigation [23] .\r\n Till date, however, the use of Advax as an adjuvant for vaccines delivered via the respiratory tract, has been less well investigated. A single study by Murugappan et al. [28] showed that pulmonary coadministration of a liquid influenza vaccine formulation with Advax induced a more balanced Th1\/Th2 profile with a modest increase of only nasal IgA titers [28] . No enhancement in other humoral and cellular immune responses was found at the used Advax dose of 200 \u03bcg [28] . Also, the potential of Advax to boost immune responses by the alternative more commonly used mucosal route such as intranasal or when incorporated in alternative physical form such as powders, was not investigated in that study.\r\n In the present study, we investigated whether Advax adjuvant could augment immune responses to whole inactivated influenza vaccine (WIV) administered to the respiratory tract via intranasal (i.n.) or pulmonary routes as either a dry powder or liquid formulation. Further, we investigated the mechanisms whereby Advax enhanced the immune responses to influenza vaccine administered via the respiratory tract. Lastly, we explored whether a single pulmonary immunization with a low dose of WIV adjuvanted with Advax would provide protection against lethal viral challenge.\r\n For the immunization study, Influenza A strain NIBRG 23, a reassortant virus from A\/turkey\/Turkey\/1\/2005 (H5N1) and A\/PR\/8\/34 (H1N1) was grown in embryonated chicken eggs by allantoic inoculation of the seed virus and purified as described previously [12] . For the challenge experiments, a mouse-adapted Influenza A\/PR\/8\/34 (H1N1) virus propagated in allantoic fluid of 10-day old embryonated hens eggs was used.\r\n Live virus was inactivated by an overnight treatment of 0.1% \u03b2propiolactone (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) in citrate buffer (125 mM sodium citrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 8.2) at 4\u00b0C. Then, inactivated virus was dialyzed overnight against Hepes buffer (145 mM NaCl, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, sterilized by autoclaving) to completely remove \u03b2-propiolactone. Protein content of the WIV preparation was determined by micro-Lowry assay and hemagglutinin (HA) was assumed to be 1\/3rd of the total protein content of the inactivated virus [12] .\r\n Spray-freeze drying (SFD) was performed by mixing WIV or WIV-Advax (Advax\u2122 adjuvant, Vaxine Pty Ltd., Adelaide, Australia) (HA:Advax 1:100 (w\/w)) with a water soluble form of inulin which was used as a lyoprotectant and bulking agent (4 kDa, Sensus, Roosendaal, The Netherlands). For WIV and WIV-Advax formulations, the HA:inulin weight ratio was 1:200 and 1:100, respectively, thus obtaining dispersions with composition HA:inulin 1:200 (w\/w) and HA:Advax:inulin 1:100:100 (w\/w\/w). The HA:inulin weight ratios of 1:200 and 1:100 were based upon a dose of 5 \u03bcg HA with or without 500 \u03bcg of Advax in 1 mg of SFD powder. A two-fluid nozzle (diameter 0.5 mm) of a Buchi 190 Mini Spray Dryer (Buchi, Flawil, Switzerland) was used to pump the dispersions at a flow rate of 5 ml\/min which was then sprayed in a vessel of liquid nitrogen using an atomizing airflow of 600 L n \/h. Drying was performed in Christ Epsilon 2-4 freeze dryer with a shelf temperature of \u221235\u00b0C and at a pressure of 0.220 mbar; the shelf temperature was gradually increased to 4\u00b0C over a time period of 32 h. For secondary drying, the temperature was further gradually increased to 20\u00b0C and pressure was lowered to 0.05 mbar during the consecutive 12 h. The vaccine powder was collected in a climate box with relative humidity of 0% and was stored under airtight conditions.\r\n The size of WIV before and after addition of Advax was determined by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) (Malvern Zetasizer ZS90, Malvern, United Kingdom). Likewise, the size of Advax was also measured before and after addition of WIV. For sample preparation, WIV and Advax were either used alone or mixed in an HA:Advax ratio of 1:100 (w\/w). Particle size analysis was done using the Zetasizer software.\r\n Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were captured using a Philips CM120 transmission electron microscope. SFD powder containing Advax was reconstituted in sterile filtered water. Liquid and reconstituted SFD Advax containing formulations were placed on a plain carbon grid and after rinsing with water samples were stained twice with 5 \u03bcl of 2 wt-% uranyl acetate. Images were taken with a Gatan type UltraScan 4000SP CCD Camera at a magnification of 17,000\u00d7. The morphology of the SFD powders was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Jeol JSM 6301-F microscope. A double sided sticky carbon tape on a metal disc was used and powders were placed on it. Then, the particles were coated with 30 nm of gold using a Balzer's 120B sputtering device (Balzer, Union, Austria). Images were captured at a magnification of 500\u00d7 and 5000\u00d7.\r\n Primary particle size distribution of SFD powders, was determined by laser diffraction. Powders were dispersed at a pressure of 0.1 bar and RODOS (Sympatec, Clausthal-Zellerfeld Germany) was used as the disperser. A 100 nm (R3) lens was used. Fraunhofer theory was used to calculate the geometric particle size distribution.\r\n The receptor binding activity of WIV after SFD was assessed by the hemagglutination assay as described previously [12] . Briefly, WIV was reconstituted in PBS and 50 \u03bcl was added to 96 V bottom plates containing 50 \u03bcl of PBS. Two-fold serial dilutions were prepared after which 50 \u03bcl of 1% guinea pig red blood cells suspension was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and hemagglutination titers were read after 2 h. Hemagglutination titers are expressed as log 2 of the highest dilution where RBC agglutination could be seen. Groningen, The Netherlands (Permit number: AVD105002016599) and Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia (Permit number: 838\/12). In-vivo experiments were carried out on 6-8 weeks old female BALB\/c mice (Elevage Janvier, Le Genets-St-Isle, France). Mice were randomly divided into eight groups consisting of 6 mice\/group. In order to investigate whether co-administration of Advax with influenza vaccine would boost immune responses, a weakly immunogenic strain of influenza virus (NIBRG-23) was chosen. Mice were immunized with WIV, however, as is routine in the influenza vaccine field given that HA is the dominant protective antigen, the dose used for immunization is represented by its HA content (~1\/3rd of the total protein content of the inactivated virus). Mice were vaccinated twice at 3 weeks interval with vaccine formulations containing 5 \u03bcg HA of NIBRG-23. For intramuscular (i.m.) vaccination, 50 \u03bcl of vaccine formulation containing 5 \u03bcg HA without adjuvant was divided over both hind legs. For intranasal (i.n.) immunization, 15 \u03bcl of vaccine formulation containing 5 \u03bcg HA with or without 500 \u03bcg Advax (HA:Advax 1:100) was slowly administered using a pipette in both nares (7.5 \u03bcl in each nare).\r\n For pulmonary administration of liquid vaccines (Pul Liq), 25 \u03bcl of vaccine containing 5 \u03bcg HA with or without 500 \u03bcg Advax (HA:Advax 1:100) was administered in the trachea of mice via microsyringe; followed by insufflation of 200 \u03bcl of air to assure deep lung deposition [11] . For vaccine powder delivery (Pul Pow), 1 mg of powder containing 5 \u03bcg HA with or without 500 \u03bcg Advax (HA:Advax 1:100), was administered to lungs of each animal by applying three puffs of 200 \u03bcl air via a dry powder insufflator, as described previously [7] . Negative control animals were left untreated.\r\n On the day of second immunization, blood was collected by retroorbital puncture. One week after the second vaccine dose, mice were sacrificed and the obtained sera was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further analysis. Nose washes and bronchioalveolar lavages (BAL) were collected by flushing 1 ml PBS containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche, Almere, Netherlands), through nasopharynx and lungs, respectively. Lavages were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further use. Spleens and lungs were collected in complete IMDM media containing 100 U\/ml penicillin, 100 mg\/ml streptomycin, 0.05 M 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) and 5% fetal calf serum (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). Spleens were processed to single cell suspensions and passed through cell strainers; followed by RBC lysis using hypotonic medium (0.83% NH 4 Cl, 10 mM KHCO 3 , 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2). Bone marrows were treated in a similar way as spleens to process single cell suspension. Lungs were processed to single cell suspensions as described previously [29] . Splenocytes and bone marrow cells were used for individual mice and lung lymphocytes were pooled per experimental group. Lung lymphocytes were pooled for each experimental group due to lack of enough cells in individual animals for a number of the readouts investigated in the study.\r\n Sera, nose washes and BAL were used for the determination of influenza-specific antibody responses. IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgA antibodies were detected by overnight coating of ELISA plates (Grenier Bio-One, Alphen, The Netherlands) with 500 ng\/well of WIV at 37\u00b0C. ELISA was performed as described previously [7] . Absorbance was measured at 492 nm using a Synergy HT Reader (BioTek, Winooski, USA). For the determination of average IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a titers, log 10 of the reciprocal of the sample dilution corresponding to an absorbance at 492 nm of 0.2 was used. Nose and lung IgA levels are presented as average of the absorbance at 492 nm for undiluted nose and lung washes.\r\n Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay was performed as described previously [30] . Briefly, sera were pooled from each experimental group and 4 hemagglutination units (4 HAU) of inactivated virus were added to two-fold diluted serum samples. Sera were pooled as the sample volume in individual animals was not enough for the assay. HI titers were recorded as the highest serum dilution capable of preventing hemagglutination of RBCs.\r\n Microneutralization assay (MN) was performed as described previously [29] . Briefly, 50TCID 50 \/well of NIBRG-23 virus were added to two-fold serial dilution of sera samples and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. After 2 h, the virus-serum mixture was transferred to MDCK cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Thereafter, virus-serum mixture was discarded and culture supernatants were supplemented with medium containing 5 \u03bcg\/ml of TPCK trypsin and were incubated for an additional 72 h. Subsequently, MN titers were calculated by recording hemagglutinating activity as the highest serum dilution capable of preventing hemagglutination.\r\n B cell ELIspot was performed as previously described with some modifications [31] . MultiScreenHTS-HA filter plates (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts) were coated with 10 \u03bcg\/ml of NIBRG-23 overnight at 4\u00b0C. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 and twice with PBS. Plates were then blocked with 1% BSA for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. 1 \u00d7 10 6 lymphocytes from lungs or splenocytes in 100 \u03bcl IMDM complete medium with 10% FBS were added to wells and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . Following incubation, cells were washed with PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20. Subsequently, alkaline phosphatase labeled anti-mouse IgA antibody (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie B.V., Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) or horse radish peroxidase labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, USA) was added to the wells and incubated for 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Wells were washed thoroughly with PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20. The numbers of IgA and IgG antibody secreting cells (ASC) were identified using 5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP)\/nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) substrate (Roche, Almere, The Netherlands), respectively. Spots were counted by using ELISpot reader (A.EL.VIS ELISpot reader, Hannover, Germany).\r\n The number of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 producing cells in spleens were determined using Ready SET-Go ELIspot kits (eBioscience, Vienna, Austria). Briefly, 5 \u00d7 10 5 splenocytes or lymphocytes from lung were added to MultiScreenHTS-HA filter plates pre-coated with anti-IFN-\u03b3 or anti-IL-4 antibodies. Then, plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in IMDM complete medium with or without 10 \u03bcg\/ml WIV (NIBRG-23). For IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 ELISpot, plates were stained as per manufacturer's protocols. Spots were counted by using an A. EL.VIS ELISpot reader.\r\n To determine IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 levels in the spleens of immunized mice, Ready SET-Go ELISA kits (R&D systems Biotechne, Minnesota, USA) were used according to manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, 5 \u00d7 10 5 splenocytes or lymphocytes from lung were added to round bottom plates and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in IMDM complete medium with or without 10 \u03bcg\/ml WIV (NIBRG-23). Cell supernatant was collected and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until used. \r\n For the challenge study, female BALB\/c mice 6-8 weeks of age (n = 3) were immunized once via pulmonary route with 0.1 \u03bcg of A\/ PR\/8\/34 WIV with or without 1 mg of Advax adjuvant. The rationale for the 0.1 \u03bcg WIV immunization dose for challenge study was that this was found to be the optimal vaccine dose to see differences between groups in clinical outcomes, whereas 5 \u03bcg HA was found to be the optimal dose to see differences between groups in immunogenicity measures such as HI and MN. The vaccine was administered under anaesthesia using an intratracheal intubation and a microsprayer. Two weeks after the immunization, animals were challenged with a live virus (A\/ PR\/8\/34). The 50% mouse lethal dose (LD 50 ) of the virus was estimated in adult BALB\/c mice by the Reed-Muench method [32] . One LD 50 corresponded to 1250 TCID 50 on MDCK cells (data not shown) and the virus challenge dose used was 10,000 TCID 50 (8xLD 50 ) administered intranasally in a volume of 30 \u03bcl which gave 100% lethality in control non-immunized mice. Daily weights and a sickness scoring system based on coat condition, posture and activity was used to assess the extent of clinical disease with mice evaluated daily. Ruffled fur (absent = 0; slightly present = 1; present = 2), hunched back (absent = 0; slightly present = 1; present = 2) and activity (normal = 0; reduced = 1; severely reduced = 2). The final score was the addition of each individual symptom score (e.g. an animal showing slightly ruffled fur (1), slightly hunched back (1) and reduced activity (1) was scored as 3. Mice were euthanized if they had developed a clinical score of 6.\r\n Mann Whitney U Test was performed for statistical analysis of data. A two tailed test was performed to compare non-adjuvanted vs adjuvanted or i.m. vs adjuvanted WIV formulations. p values < 0.05 were considered to be significant. *, ** and *** represent p values less than or equal to 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. A Cox-Mantel log rang test was used to compare the difference in survival between Advaxadjuvanted WIV group and WIV alone i.e. without adjuvant.\r\n For the use of Advax as a mucosal adjuvant for WIV, it is essential that it has no detrimental effects on the physical and biological properties of inactivated virus particles; and that SFD has no impact on the physical characteristics of Advax. DLS measurements revealed that mixing with Advax had a negligible effect on the size of WIV with liquid WIV without adjuvant having a size of~185 nm and Advax-adjuvanted liquid WIV formulation having a size of~186 nm (Fig. 1A) . Likewise, the size of Advax particles remained unaltered for Advax only (1522 nm) and Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation (1535 nm).\r\n Furthermore, we evaluated whether SFD had an impact on the physical appearance of Advax particles. For this, Advax was SFD without WIV, but in the presence of water soluble inulin as the stabilizer. TEM analysis revealed that Advax particles had comparable morphology before and after SFD (Fig. 1B) .\r\n In order to investigate whether Advax had an effect on the physical characteristics of SFD powder formulation, the physical appearance of powder particles was analyzed by SEM. SEM images revealed intact spherically shaped particles with an interconnected porous structure for both SFD WIV without adjuvant (Fig. 1C) and SFD Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations (Fig. 1D) . Further, upon dispersion from RODOS, the average geometric particle size (X 50 ) of SFD Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation was found to be comparable to SFD non-adjuvanted WIV formulation, i.e. 8.64 and 9.12 \u03bcm, respectively (Fig. 1E ). An important criterion for particles to be suitable for inhalation is their aerodynamic particle size, which ideally should be 1-5 \u03bcm [33, 34] . Aerodynamic particle size was calculated according to the formula described by Bhide et al. [35] . Aerodynamic particle size of both WIV and Advax-adjuvanted WIV after SFD were found to be in the required size range, i.e. 1-5 \u03bcm, thus indicating the suitability of both these formulations for pulmonary immunization (Fig. 1F) . Thus, upon SFD of WIV formulated either with or without Advax, powder particles with a similar size and morphology were formed making a fair comparison between the nonadjuvanted and Advax-adjuvanted SFD powders possible.\r\n It is well known that the existence of HA in its native conformation is crucial for its receptor binding activity and the induction of immune responses [9] . Thus, in order to evaluate whether or not the receptor binding activity of HA was preserved after the addition of Advax and after SFD, hemagglutination assay was performed. All formulations showed similar hemagglutination titers indicating that admixing WIV with Advax and SFD did not have destabilizing effects on HA (Fig. 1G) . Overall, the data showed that SFD can be used to produce an Advaxadjuvanted WIV dry powder formulation suitable for pulmonary administration.\r\n Previous pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that co-administration of influenza vaccine with Advax via the conventional parenteral route substantially enhanced systemic immunity [19, 27, 36] . Thus, in order to investigate the potential of Advax as a mucosal adjuvant, systemic immune responses were determined either three weeks after the first (day 21) or one week after the second immunization (day 28) or at both these time points. Non-vaccinated animals were used as negative control. It had been found in previous studies that immunization with Advax alone had no detectable effect on immune parameters when compared to mice injected with saline (unpublished data). Moreover, only influenza specific immune responses were measured. Therefore, any parameters that might be induced by the use of Advax alone could not be quantified. Hence, Advax alone group was not included in this study.\r\n We first evaluated the number of IgG or IgA ASC in splenocytes of mice vaccinated with non-adjuvanted and Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations ( Fig. 2A) . We found that respiratory tract immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations either as liquid or powder led to a Left and right side SEM pictures are captured at a magnification of 500\u00d7 and 5000\u00d7, respectively. (E) Geometric particle size of SFD WIV or Advax-adjuvanted WIV after dispersion from RODOS (n = 6). (F) Aerodynamic particle size of SFD WIV or Advax-adjuvanted WIV (G) Hemagglutination titers of WIV and Advax-adjuvanted WIV before and after SFD (n = 3); no differences were found among the triplicates within a group. Data are presented as average \u00b1 standard error of the mean for Fig. 1A , E and F. significantly higher number of IgG and IgA ASC than immunization with corresponding non-adjuvanted WIV formulations. As expected, delivery of WIV via the i.m. route led to the production of only few IgA ASC but a considerable number of IgG ASC in the spleen ( Fig. 2A) .\r\n We next evaluated serum anti-influenza IgG titers both after the first and second immunization. Both i.m. and respiratory tract delivery of WIV formulations, with or without Advax, induced serum IgG responses after the first immunization that were further increased after the booster dose (Fig. 2B) . Furthermore, respiratory tract delivery of Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations, either as liquid or powder, generated significantly higher IgG titers than the corresponding non-adjuvanted WIV formulations after the second immunization. The higher serum IgG titers induced by Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations were in line with a significant increase in splenic IgG ASC Serum IgG titers generated by respiratory tract administered Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations were comparable to those generated by non-adjuvanted WIV formulation given via the i.m. route at both day 21 and day 28 (Fig. 2B) . Coherent with IgG titers, IgG1 responses were significantly enhanced in mice immunized with Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations via the respiratory tract versus mice immunized with non-adjuvanted WIV formulations (Fig. 2C) . However, IgG2a responses were only significantly enhanced for Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations, both liquid and powder, administered to the lungs but not by i.n. administration (Fig. 2D) . Moreover, a balanced IgG2a:IgG1 ratio was observed, indicating that Advax-adjuvanted WIV induces a balanced Th1\/Th2 type of immune response in agreement with our previous study where a balanced Th1\/Th2 ratio was observed after pulmonary administration of a liquid, Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation [28] .\r\n The functional potential of IgG antibodies in serum was assessed by the HI and MN assay. Both at day 21 and day 28, Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations administered to the lungs induced substantially higher HI titers than non-adjuvanted WIV formulations (Fig. 2E ). In line with the HI titers, approximately five-six fold higher MN titers were seen for Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations administered to the respiratory tract than for corresponding non-adjuvanted WIV formulations (Fig. 2F) . The higher HI and MN titers for Advax-adjuvanted WIV were consistent with the higher serum IgG titers, thus indicating the functional effectiveness of the vaccine-induced IgG antibodies in these groups.\r\n Thus, Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations administered to the respiratory tract induced comparable systemic immune responses as WIV administered via the i.m. route and considerably higher immune responses than non-adjuvanted respiratory tract administered WIV.\r\n An important goal of influenza vaccination is the induction of antibodies in the respiratory tract, the portal of influenza virus entry [37, 38] . The traditional parenteral route of influenza vaccine administration is inefficient in inducing mucosal immune responses. Similarly, pulmonary immunization with non-adjuvanted WIV generally induces only low levels of local or mucosal immunity [9, 12] . In order to investigate the potential of Advax to boost local mucosal immunity, respiratory tract immunity was determined a week after the second immunization by assessment of nasal IgA and BAL anti-influenza IgA and IgG levels along with ASC in lungs. As expected, WIV administered via the i.m. route failed to induce substantial nasal or lung IgA titers (Fig. 3A, B) . Compared to the i.m. route, higher nose IgA titers were found for Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations administered to the respiratory tract, which, however, were only significantly higher for the liquid formulation administered to the nose and the powder formulation administered to the lungs (Fig. 3A ). Yet, compared to non-adjuvanted WIV formulation, only the Advax-adjuvanted liquid formulation administered to the lungs elicited significantly higher nasal IgA titers. By contrast, a significant effect of Advax adjuvant was seen on BAL IgA in both the i.n. and pulmonary vaccine groups with approximately four-eight-fold higher lung IgA titers than mice immunized with corresponding non-adjuvanted WIV formulations (Fig. 3B) . Hence, Advax either administered i.n. or into the lungs increased lung but not nasal IgA production. This might be due to the relatively smaller surface area of the nasal mucosa compared to that of the lower respiratory tract [39] . Since 1 ml of PBS was used for collecting both nasal and lung washes, the concentration of IgA in the lung washes would be expected to be much higher than in the nasal washes if the amount of IgA per specific surface area in the lung and nose would be the same. The fact that only pulmonary powder but not liquid delivery where adjuvanted or WIV alone induced increased nasal IgA, might suggest powder particles may have been exhaled by the mice back up from the bronchi into the nasal nares after the insufflation procedure, whereas the liquid vaccine may have been more likely to instantly adhere to the bronchial walls and thereby not remain suspended in air and able to escape into the nose.\r\n Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations administered to the respiratory tract significantly increased anti-influenza IgG titers in the lungs in accordance with the increased serum IgG titers seen in these animals when compared to corresponding non-adjuvanted WIV immunizations (Fig. 3C) . Interestingly, lung IgG titers of mice immunized with WIV-Advax formulations administered to the respiratory tract were significantly higher than those immunized with non-adjuvanted WIV formulation via the i.m. route (Fig. 3C) . The boost in lung IgA and IgG titers after Advax-adjuvanted respiratory tract immunization of WIV, is consistent with the increased number of IgA and IgG ASC found in the lungs of these mice (Fig. 3D) .\r\n Hence, the inclusion of Advax in WIV formulations resulted in significantly higher mucosal humoral immune responses than non-adjuvanted WIV formulation administered via the respiratory tract or via i.m. route.\r\n The phenotype of an immune response (skewed Th1 or Th2 or balanced Th1\/Th2) is considered to be of importance for its protective potential [28, 40, 41] . A balanced Th1\/Th2 response is preferable because it aids in both virus neutralization and clearance [41] . In order to investigate whether incorporation of Advax in a WIV formulation and delivery of the adjuvanted vaccine to the respiratory tract has an influence on the type and magnitude of cell-mediated immune responses induced, the frequency of influenza-specific IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 secreting splenic T cells was determined. In addition, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 levels were measured in supernatants of splenocytes stimulated in-vitro with WIV. Compared to WIV alone, Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation was associated with a significant increase in the number of IFN-\u03b3 secreting influenza-specific T cells (Fig. 4A) . Likewise, increased production of IFN-\u03b3 was seen in Advax-adjuvanted WIV groups when compared to non-adjuvanted WIV, although, the differences were only significant for the pulmonary immunized groups (Fig. 4B) . Moreover, Advax-adjuvanted WIV was associated with significantly higher frequencies of both IL-4 secreting T cells as well as significantly higher amounts of IL-4 in the culture supernatants as compared to WIV alone (Fig. 4C, D) . By contrast, i.m. administered WIV induced a high number of IL-4 secreting T cells but low numbers of IFN-\u03b3 secreting T cells (Fig. 4A, C) , which was matched by the IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 levels measured in the culture supernatants (Fig. 4B, D) .\r\n Thus, immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV via the respiratory tract led to a balanced Th1\/Th2 (IFN-\u03b3\/IL-4) response whereas i.m. immunization with WIV alone predominantly induced a Th2-type (predominant IL-4) immune response.\r\n Advax-adjuvanted WIV, administered either as liquid or powder formulation, induced comparable humoral and cellular immune responses when administered via the pulmonary route. Hence, only liquid Advax-adjuvanted WIV was used as a representative formulation for further mechanistic investigations into the types of B and T cells responding to immunization.\r\n Antigen-activated B cells undergo isotype class switching and change the production of antibody subtype from IgM and IgD to IgG, IgA or IgE [42] . In order to characterize the phenotype of class switched B cells, we determined the fraction of memory B cells among the total number of class switched B cells after i.n. or pulmonary delivery of WIV alone or with Advax adjuvant. A previous study has shown that memory B cells, particularly in lungs, play a key role in protection against influenza re-infection [43] . These memory B cells can be identified by the expression of CD38 [43] [44] [45] . Hence, cells isolated from lungs, spleen and bone marrow were stained for both IgM\/IgD (to identify IgM\/IgD \u2212 class switched cells) and the memory B cell marker, CD38 (Fig. 5A-B) . Advax-adjuvanted WIV administered via the pulmonary route led to an 8-fold increase in the frequency of memory B cells in the lungs, 4-fold in spleen and about 10-fold in bone marrow in comparison to administration with WIV alone (Fig. 5A-B) . Further analysis of these cells revealed that in lungs and spleen the percentage of memory B cells was particularly high among IgG producing cells (Fig. 5C, D) while in bone marrow it was high among IgA producing B cells (Fig. 5D ). By contrast, much lower numbers of CD38 + B cells were seen in the i.n. immunized groups although still a 2-3 fold increase in lung memory B cells among IgG or IgA producing cells was observed in the Advax-adjuvanted WIV group when compared to the WIV alone group (Fig. 5A , C). Our data suggests that respiratory tract immunization, in particular, pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV induces a large number of both class-switched IgG + and IgA + memory B cells with the IgG + memory B cells primarily trafficking to the lungs and spleen and the IgA + memory B cells instead trafficking to the bone marrow.\r\n Previous studies have shown that CXCR3 and CD69 promote lung homing of B cells and effector T cells after infection with influenza virus [43, 46, 47] . Pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV increased the percentage of class-switched B cells expressing the lung localization marker, CXCR3 (Fig. 5E ), by about 4-fold, with a slight increase in the percentage expressing CD69 (Fig. 5F ). Interestingly, i.n. immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV induced a 2-fold increase in CD69 + B cells but no increase in CXCR3 expressing B cells (Fig. 5E, F) . Likewise, pulmonary but not i.n. immunization of Advax-adjuvanted WIV enhanced the number of class-switched B cells expressing CXCR3 (Fig. S3) .\r\n Overall, respiratory tract delivery, in particular pulmonary delivery, of Advax-adjuvanted WIV increased the frequency of class-switched memory B cells and enhanced the expression of localization factors i.e. CXCR3 and CD69 on these class-switched B cells.\r\n Memory CD4 + T cells are assumed to be the key players in promoting the production of long-lived ASC and memory B cells, thus facilitating rapid production of antibodies in cases of antigen recall [48, 49] . Effector\/memory T cells are identified by the expression of CD44 and absence of CD62L and are thus denoted as CD44 + CD62L \u2212 . Pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV led to a~3-fold increase in lung effector\/memory CD4 + T cells in comparison to administration of WIV alone (Fig. 6A) . Previous studies have shown that even in the absence of B cells and CD8 + effector\/memory T cells, CD4 + effector\/memory T cells can provide at least partial protection against influenza infection with recruitment of CD4 + T effector\/memory cells to the lungs [50, 51] . This recruitment is facilitated by the expression of lung localization factors on effector\/memory T cells [46] .\r\n Tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) are a subset of memory T cells that express CD103 and lack the property of recirculation, so they remain restricted within tissues thereby making them readily available to protect against local infection [52, 53] . Besides CD103, the expression of CXCR3 on effector\/memory is known to promote their migration and localization to infected lungs [46, 47, 54] . We therefore characterized CD4 + effector\/memory T cells for the expression of the lung localization factor CXCR3 and the tissue resident T cell marker CD103. I.n. immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation showed a minor increase in the percentage of CXCR3 + cells as compared to the corresponding non-adjuvanted WIV formulation. By contrast, pulmonary administration of Advax-adjuvanted WIV enhanced the percentage of CD4 + effector\/memory expressing CXCR3 by 3-fold (Fig. 6B) . Consistent with previous studies we also found that the augmented expression of CXCR3 on effector\/memory T cells led to an increase in the migration of these cells to the lungs (Fig. 6A) . Staining of the TRM marker, CD103, revealed that adjuvantation with Advax led to an approximately 2-fold increase in CD4 + TRMs in the lungs for pulmonary as well as for i.n. administered vaccine (Fig. 6C) . Thus, immunization of mice with Advax-adjuvanted WIV, in particular via the pulmonary route, increased effector\/memory T cells with augmentation in the expression of CXCR3 and CD103 cells in the lungs. This is consistent with previous studies, which showed that mucosal administration of an antigen is necessary for the generation of local T cell responses [53, 55, 56] .\r\n Conclusively, co-administration of WIV with Advax resulted in an enhanced number of effector\/memory CD4 + T cells with a moderate increase in the expression of lung localization factors and TRM cell markers.\r\n Respiratory tract immunization (i.n. and pulmonary) with Advaxadjuvanted WIV has shown in the experiments above to boost humoral and cellular immunity both systemically and locally in the lung. However, in the mechanistic studies, mainly, pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV was found to boost memory responses and the expression of lung localization factors. Hence, the pulmonary route was chosen for a challenge study. In the challenge study, we explored whether the enhanced immunity translated into enhanced protection if mice were exposed to a lethal dose of influenza virus. To maximize the stringency of the model, mice received just a single dose of pulmonary WIV (A\/PR\/8\/34) with or without Advax. An Advax alone (without antigen) control group was not included as in previous studies we Levels of significance are denoted as *p \u2264 0.05 and **p \u2264 0.01. observed no effect of administering Advax alone on influenza disease, with recipients of Advax alone having the same clinical scores and dying at the same rate as saline-injected controls, whether the Advax was given i.m. [27] or via the pulmonary route (unpublished data). Since a highly immunogenic influenza virus strain was used, a low dose of 0.1 \u03bcg WIV with or without 1 mg of Advax was found to be optimal to avoid complete protection that might be induced by antigen alone (without adjuvant) with a high dose. After lethal viral challenge, we found that, mice that received non-adjuvanted WIV were not protected against influenza infection, as evidenced by a rapid weight loss and a clinical sickness score of 6 within 8-9 days after challenge ( Fig. 7A-C) . By contrast, mice that received a single pulmonary dose of WIV formulated with Advax adjuvant were fully protected with no weight loss and no clinical disease symptoms after challenge (Fig. 7A-C) . A Cox- Mantel log rank test revealed that the difference in survival between non-adjuvanted WIV and Advax-adjuvanted WIV group was significant (p = 0.029). Similar outcome was obtained upon repetition of the experiments twice.\r\n In the current study, we demonstrate that administration of Advaxadjuvanted WIV to the respiratory tract, either as liquid or dry powder, has the potential to boost influenza induced systemic, mucosal and cellular immune responses. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that an effective Advax-adjuvanted dry powder influenza vaccine formulation with full retention of biological activity of the WIV antigen and the Advax adjuvant can be prepared by SFD. Though both liquid and dry powder influenza vaccine formulations can be used for pulmonary administration, a dry powder formulation is preferable due to its long-term stability at ambient temperatures, which facilitates stockpiling [10, 57, 58] . In cases of an influenza pandemic, a stockpiled dry powder formulation would be readily available and easy to administer in mass vaccination campaigns. For Advax-adjuvanted influenza formulations, the i.n. and pulmonary route were found to be equally effective in boosting humoral and cellular immunity, however, pulmonary route was found to be superior for the augmentation of memory responses as well as lung localization factors. Moreover, pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV was found to be equally effective as an i.m. immunization with WIV in terms of induction of systemic and cellular immunity and was superior in terms of mucosal immunity. In addition, a single pulmonary administration with Advax-adjuvanted WIV at a low dose of 0.1 \u03bcg WIV not only protected the animals from weight loss and observable clinical symptoms but also led to their complete survival which is in contrast to the animals immunized with WIV alone. Moreover, no adverse effects (weight loss, sickness) were seen in animals that received pulmonary immunization with Advax adjuvant. Hence, inhalation of Advax-adjuvanted influenza vaccine as either a liquid or a dry powder formulation may be a promising alternative to conventional parenteral influenza vaccines.\r\n Study limitations include the fact that the impact of the vaccine on direct measures of virus replication in the lung were not assessed, nor were studies of lung histology performed. These more detailed aspects of the mechanism of protection and of pulmonary adjuvanted vaccine safety will need to be studied in the future. However, we expect that the enhanced protection against clinical disease with WIV plus Advax, would be reflected in lower lung virus titers post-challenge. In future studies, it would also be interesting to investigate how the increased tissue resident memory B and T cell responses elicited after pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV might contribute to longterm protection against influenza, as only short term protection was assessed in this study. Conclusively, we have demonstrated that Advax is a highly effective mucosal adjuvant which can be formulated with influenza vaccine into dry powders and enables complete protection against lethal influenza virus challenge with just a single low dose of antigen. This approach may thereby provide a convenient needle free approach for influenza vaccination.\r\n Supplementary data to this article can be found online at https:\/\/ doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jconrel.2018.09.006.

Injected vaccines generate strong systemic immunity but minimal mucosal immunity [6, 7] . administration for preventing influenza associated illness [8] . Adjuvantation of parenterally administered vaccines with Advax has shown to improve the immunogenicity and protective capacity of several vaccine candidates against hepatitis B, anthrax, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, listeria and influenza [21, [24] [25] [26] [27] . or pulmonary routes as either a dry powder or liquid formulation. For the challenge experiments, a mouse-adapted Influenza A\/PR\/8\/34 (H1N1) virus propagated in allantoic fluid of 10-day old embryonated hens eggs was used. Live virus was inactivated by an overnight treatment of 0.1% \u03b2propiolactone (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) in citrate buffer (125 mM sodium citrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 8.2) at 4\u00b0C. For WIV and WIV-Advax formulations, the HA:inulin weight ratio was 1:200 and 1:100, respectively, thus obtaining dispersions with composition HA:inulin 1:200 (w\/w) and HA:Advax:inulin 1:100:100 (w\/w\/w). The size of WIV before and after addition of Advax was determined by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) (Malvern Zetasizer ZS90, Malvern, United Kingdom). Likewise, the size of Advax was also measured before and after addition of WIV. Particle size analysis was done using the Zetasizer software. Images were taken with a Gatan type UltraScan 4000SP CCD Camera at a magnification of 17,000\u00d7. The morphology of the SFD powders was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Jeol JSM 6301-F microscope. A double sided sticky carbon tape on a metal disc was used and powders were placed on it. The receptor binding activity of WIV after SFD was assessed by the hemagglutination assay as described previously [12] . Two-fold serial dilutions were prepared after which 50 \u03bcl of 1% guinea pig red blood cells suspension was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and hemagglutination titers were read after 2 h. Hemagglutination titers are expressed as log 2 of the highest dilution where RBC agglutination could be seen. Groningen, The Netherlands (Permit number: AVD105002016599) and Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia (Permit number: 838\/12). Mice were randomly divided into eight groups consisting of 6 mice\/group. Mice were immunized with WIV, however, as is routine in the influenza vaccine field given that HA is the dominant protective antigen, the dose used for immunization is represented by its HA content (~1\/3rd of the total protein content of the inactivated virus). For pulmonary administration of liquid vaccines (Pul Liq), 25 \u03bcl of vaccine containing 5 \u03bcg HA with or without 500 \u03bcg Advax (HA:Advax 1:100) was administered in the trachea of mice via microsyringe; followed by insufflation of 200 \u03bcl of air to assure deep lung deposition [11] . Negative control animals were left untreated. On the day of second immunization, blood was collected by retroorbital puncture. Lavages were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further use. Bone marrows were treated in a similar way as spleens to process single cell suspension. Lung lymphocytes were pooled for each experimental group due to lack of enough cells in individual animals for a number of the readouts investigated in the study. Absorbance was measured at 492 nm using a Synergy HT Reader (BioTek, Winooski, USA). Microneutralization assay (MN) was performed as described previously [29] . Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 and twice with PBS. Plates were then blocked with 1% BSA for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, alkaline phosphatase labeled anti-mouse IgA antibody (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie B.V., Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) or horse radish peroxidase labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, USA) was added to the wells and incubated for 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Wells were washed thoroughly with PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20. Spots were counted by using ELISpot reader (A.EL.VIS ELISpot reader, Hannover, Germany). The number of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 producing cells in spleens were determined using Ready SET-Go ELIspot kits (eBioscience, Vienna, Austria). Briefly, 5 \u00d7 10 5 splenocytes or lymphocytes from lung were added to round bottom plates and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in IMDM complete medium with or without 10 \u03bcg\/ml WIV (NIBRG-23). The vaccine was administered under anaesthesia using an intratracheal intubation and a microsprayer. Ruffled fur (absent = 0; slightly present = 1; present = 2), hunched back (absent = 0; slightly present = 1; present = 2) and activity (normal = 0; reduced = 1; severely reduced = 2). The final score was the addition of each individual symptom score (e.g. an animal showing slightly ruffled fur (1), slightly hunched back (1) and reduced activity (1) was scored as 3. Mice were euthanized if they had developed a clinical score of 6. Mann Whitney U Test was performed for statistical analysis of data. p values < 0.05 were considered to be significant. *, ** and *** represent p values less than or equal to 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. A Cox-Mantel log rang test was used to compare the difference in survival between Advaxadjuvanted WIV group and WIV alone i.e. without adjuvant. TEM analysis revealed that Advax particles had comparable morphology before and after SFD (Fig. Further, upon dispersion from RODOS, the average geometric particle size (X 50 ) of SFD Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation was found to be comparable to SFD non-adjuvanted WIV formulation, i.e. 8.64 and 9.12 \u03bcm, respectively (Fig. Thus, in order to evaluate whether or not the receptor binding activity of HA was preserved after the addition of Advax and after SFD, hemagglutination assay was performed. Previous pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that co-administration of influenza vaccine with Advax via the conventional parenteral route substantially enhanced systemic immunity [19, 27, 36] . Non-vaccinated animals were used as negative control. Data are presented as average \u00b1 standard error of the mean for Fig. In line with the HI titers, approximately five-six fold higher MN titers were seen for Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations administered to the respiratory tract than for corresponding non-adjuvanted WIV formulations (Fig. Thus, Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations administered to the respiratory tract induced comparable systemic immune responses as WIV administered via the i.m. As expected, WIV administered via the i.m. route failed to induce substantial nasal or lung IgA titers (Fig. In addition, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 levels were measured in supernatants of splenocytes stimulated in-vitro with WIV. or pulmonary delivery of WIV alone or with Advax adjuvant. immunized groups although still a 2-3 fold increase in lung memory B cells among IgG or IgA producing cells was observed in the Advax-adjuvanted WIV group when compared to the WIV alone group (Fig. Previous studies have shown that CXCR3 and CD69 promote lung homing of B cells and effector T cells after infection with influenza virus [43, 46, 47] . Pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV increased the percentage of class-switched B cells expressing the lung localization marker, CXCR3 (Fig. Memory CD4 + T cells are assumed to be the key players in promoting the production of long-lived ASC and memory B cells, thus facilitating rapid production of antibodies in cases of antigen recall [48, 49] . Effector\/memory T cells are identified by the expression of CD44 and absence of CD62L and are thus denoted as CD44 + CD62L \u2212 . Thus, immunization of mice with Advax-adjuvanted WIV, in particular via the pulmonary route, increased effector\/memory T cells with augmentation in the expression of CXCR3 and CD103 cells in the lungs. 27] or via the pulmonary route (unpublished data). Since a highly immunogenic influenza virus strain was used, a low dose of 0.1 \u03bcg WIV with or without 1 mg of Advax was found to be optimal to avoid complete protection that might be induced by antigen alone (without adjuvant) with a high dose. Though both liquid and dry powder influenza vaccine formulations can be used for pulmonary administration, a dry powder formulation is preferable due to its long-term stability at ambient temperatures, which facilitates stockpiling [10, 57, 58] . In cases of an influenza pandemic, a stockpiled dry powder formulation would be readily available and easy to administer in mass vaccination campaigns. immunization with WIV in terms of induction of systemic and cellular immunity and was superior in terms of mucosal immunity. In addition, a single pulmonary administration with Advax-adjuvanted WIV at a low dose of 0.1 \u03bcg WIV not only protected the animals from weight loss and observable clinical symptoms but also led to their complete survival which is in contrast to the animals immunized with WIV alone. In future studies, it would also be interesting to investigate how the increased tissue resident memory B and T cell responses elicited after pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV might contribute to longterm protection against influenza, as only short term protection was assessed in this study. Conclusively, we have demonstrated that Advax is a highly effective mucosal adjuvant which can be formulated with influenza vaccine into dry powders and enables complete protection against lethal influenza virus challenge with just a single low dose of antigen.

Conventional methods to quantify aerosol concentration that susceptible victims in contaminated environments are exposed to use real time particle counters to measure concentrations in environments without occupancy.\r\n Breathing-induced airflow interacts and influences concentration around nostrils or mouth and alter the ultimate exposure. This subject has not yet been systematically studied, particularly under transient emission. In this work, an experimental facility comprising two manikins was designed and fabricated. One of them mimicked realistic breathing, acting as a susceptible victim. Both steady and episodic emissions were generated in an air-conditioned environmental chamber in which two different ventilation schemes were tested. The scaled-dose of the victim under different expiratory velocities and pulmonary ventilation was measured.\r\n Inferring from results obtained from comprehensive tests, it can be concluded that breathing has very significant influence on the ultimate dose compared with that without breathing. Majority of results show that breathing reduces inhalation quantity and the reduction magnitude increases with breathing rate. This is attributed to the fact that the exhalation process plays a more significant role in reducing the dose level than the enhanced effect during inhalation period. The higher the breathing rate, the sharper the decline of the resultant concentration would be leading to lower dose. Nevertheless, under low pulmonary ventilation, results show that breathing increases dose marginally. Results also reveals that ventilation scheme also affects the exposure.","text_body":"After the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the new influenza strain H1N1, community preparedness for pandemics has been the focus of much interest and effort in recent years. When a person sneezes, coughs or even talks, expiratory droplets are generated. Both large and small droplets are generated in an expiratory cloud [1] . Although still being debated, recent scientific data support the notion that pathogens can be transmitted by aerosols [2] [3] [4] .\r\n Once they are airborne in indoor environments, pathogens can be inhaled by susceptible victims. Inhalation dose depends predominantly on spatial, temporal concentration profiles and the duration of exposure to the microenvironment [5] . Many previous\r\n where DE is the duration of exposure, Q is the pulmonary ventilation and C is the temporal concentration.\r\n The conventional method to measure concentration of pathogens in a specific enclosure involves putting sampling devices (e.g., counters or impactors) in the environment. If real-time counters are used, such as laser photometers (up to 10 m), condensation particle counters (up to a few micrometers), or sizeresolved particle spectrometers (up to several tens of micrometers), temporal concentration profile can be recorded. Measurement is commonly taken at a reference location and the concentration is considered as representative of the entire indoor microenvironment. This approach completely ignores the influence of human-generated thermal plume effects on concentration profile, which has been reported to be an important factor affecting indoor concentration [6, 7] . Apart from this conventional sampling method, advancement of optical technology had led to more afford-0304-3894\/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016\/j.jhazmat.2011.06.040 able and reliable instruments to measure particle concentration non-invasively. Recently, there have been some works that have used in situ imaging technique for collecting data of exhaled aerosol dispersion [7, 8] .\r\n To better estimate inhalation dose caused by exposure to contaminants, breathing thermal manikins (BTMs) have been used. In most scenarios, metabolism rates can be adjusted according to the physical activity level considered. This gives more accurate exposure assessment as influences of thermal and pulmonary ventilation are taken into account. Sampling devices are placed very near or at the nostrils and\/or mouth openings [9] . There have been some numerical studies simulating contaminant concentration around BTM. The limitations of these studies were (i) steady inhalation assumed [10] ; (ii) only airflow around mouth was considered [11] ; and (iii) passive contaminants were used [12] .\r\n Experimental studies using BTM have been extremely scarce and most of them were focused on measuring exposure to passive contaminates [9, [13] [14] [15] [16] . Recently a study reported transportation of passive and particulate contaminants in the vicinity of breathing area of a BTM [17] . The authors concluded that thermal plume may play a significant role in contaminant transportation to breathing zone.\r\n If the objective of air sampling is to assess the concentration due to inhalation under transient concentration, temporal concentration measured by the particle sampler or counter should be representative of what would be inhaled by humans. In this regard, characteristics of both expiratory emission and pulmonary ventilation should be considered and their influences on sampling should be quantified.\r\n Typically, the process of generation of expiratory droplets is rapid and the duration is very brief. Velocity of coughing by healthy adults can be up to approximately 30 m\/s [12] . Interaction between airflow at the vicinity of the mouth or nose and the incoming expiratory droplets is very complex. Expelled airflow may reduce the contaminant dose or even eliminate it completely by the opposing airflow against the droplet flow. Likewise, inhalation-induced airflow may increase the dose.\r\n Pulmonary ventilation is calculated as the product of tidal volume and respiratory frequency, and both factors depend on many physiological factors such as gender, age and, most importantly, metabolism rates [18] . Average breathing rate of an adult at rest is usually 12 cycles\/min. During office work breathing rate can increase to 20 cycles\/min. Pulmonary ventilation for resting and moderate work is 6 and 30 liter per minute (LPM), respectively [19] . It is apparent that pulmonary ventilation affects inhalation dose. Nevertheless there is no systematic study that has quantified the effects.\r\n In extant literature there are many studies that quantify aerosol dispersion under various ventilation conditions. A few of them have investigated exposure to expiratory process for studying the influence of different ventilations on aerosol dispersion and mixing [7, 20] ; contaminant dispersion in air cabin mock-up [21] ; aerosol emitted from a nurse or patient [22] ; difference in exposure by a continuous or single expiratory emission [23] ; orientation of source-to-receptor and different ventilation schemes of aerosol dispersion and removal [24] ; and performance of personalized ventilation [25] . However, only one CFD study has considered breathing when evaluating exposure to droplets [26] . The present authors have measured expiratory droplet profiles spatially and temporally inside a 1:5 scaled chamber after a momentary release of droplets [27, 28] .\r\n Recent reviews have highlighted all parameters governing airborne infection in indoor environments [19, 29] . It is shown that ventilation plays an important role in particle concentration indoors. Two ventilation schemes, well-mixing ventilation (MV) and displacement ventilation (DIS), are commonly used in com-mercial buildings. MV schemes are the most popular ventilation arrangement for commercial buildings. In schemes of this type, high-velocity cooled air is discharged through supply grills and warm air is expelled through return grills. Both grills are located at the ceiling level. DIS schemes exhibit characteristics completely different from those of MV schemes. DIS schemes supply cooled fresh air at a low velocity to occupied zones through supply air grilles located at lower levels of rooms and expel hot air via exhausts located in the ceiling.\r\n To the best of authors' knowledge, there no study has quantified how pulmonary ventilation affects transient inhalation dose of BTM. In this work, scale of inhalation dose was determined by using a full size BTM inside a full scale environmental chamber. The experiments were conducted under MV and DIS ventilation schemes. A real-time particle counter was used to measure concentration at the mouth under steady and episodic events and interactions of movements of exhaled\/inhaled air with the droplets were carefully studied.\r\n The two manikins were located inside a full scale experimental chamber of dimensions 2.30 (L) \u00d7 2.25 (W) \u00d7 2.3 (H) m 3 . One is referred to as the \"source\" and the other as the \"susceptible victim.\" The distance between the source and the susceptible victim was kept at 60 cm. Location of supply and return air grills for the two ventilation systems are shown in Fig. 1 . For the MV scheme, the air exchange rate per hour was set to 20 h \u22121 while for the DIS scheme, it was set to 5 ACH. The indoor temperature was 24 \u00b1 0.5 \u2022 C.\r\n Two parameters were varied and studied in this work. The first one was pulmonary ventilation of the susceptible victim, set at 7 LPM, 15 LPM and 23 LPM. These values were within the range found in literature and they are classified as \"very low\", \"low\" and \"light\" pulmonary ventilation in this work. Respiratory frequency was set at 15\/min (2 s inhalation and 2 s exhalation). The second one was the emission speed. Two values were selected for tests, 15 m\/s and 30 m\/s. It was measured by a handheld hot-wire anemometer (VelociCalc 9555-P, TSI) placed at a distance of 5 cm horizontally in front of the source manikin and the velocity measured was treated as a reference. detailed schematic diagram of the experimental setup consisting of an electrical-mechanical breathing and aerosol sampling system for the susceptible victim and sneezing system for the source. The breathing and sampling system was divided into four parts, where Paths A, B and C were involved in breathing circuit while Path D was the sampling system. Each pathway is described in detail herein below.\r\n It dealt with the inhalation process. There were a total of four components in this pathway. The electrical modulating valve was controlled by user-defined LabVIEW Environment to vary the flow rate as a sinusoidal function. The manual modulating valve was used to regulate the flow rate of inhalation. The compressor was used to drive the air flowing from the manikin to the outlet. The air was forced to pass through the HEPA filter before escaping from the circuit to minimize cross-contamination in the laboratory.\r\n It dealt with the exhalation process. There were a total of six components in this path. The exhaust of the compressor was connected to the inlet of air buffer tank to stabilize the fluctuation of compressed airflow. The electrical modulating valve was connected to the air buffer tank and it was controlled by the same LabVIEW Environment to generate a sinusoidal output. In between, a manual modulating valve was used for regulating the flow rate of exhalation. Finally, the HEPA filter was used to purify the air to ensure no particles were exhaled to the mouth. In reality, non-deposited inhaled aerosols exhale out. The current approach simplified the problem but the objective of the current work was to investigate how breathing affects inhalation dose and hence the presence of exhalation aerosols does not affect the results. Besides the focus of the current work is an UFP exposure with breathing, so no effect of the CO 2 concentration was considered in this study.\r\n Both Path A and B were connected together through the equal Y connector. A common Path C was then connected to the sampling point at mouth.\r\n Path D is the sampling system. The sampling route was made to tee-off from the common Path C of the breathing system. It was directly connected to condensation particle counter (CPC) (3775, TSI) for sampling. To reduce sampling loss, the CPC was put inside the chamber.\r\n A sneezing system was setup for generating testing aerosols, which consisted of a compressor, an on\/off electrical modulating valve, a manual electrical modulating valve and a spray gun (180D, Spray-Work, Tamiya). Dilute sodium chloride (NaCl) solution was stored in a small container attached to the spray gun. The size distribution of NaCl was measured to have size ranging from 10 to 200 nm with a mode diameter of 35 nm. The on\/off electrical modulating valve governed by LabVIEW was used to control sneezing duration. The manual electrical modulating valve was used to control the flow rate of sneezing.\r\n The chamber door was closed and the breathing system of the susceptible victim was turned on remotely. Before each emission, the background concentration level was checked to ensure the current measurement was not affected by the previous experimental setup. The compressor was then turned on remotely and the whole expiratory process, which lasted 4 s, was initiated by the LabVIEW. Aerosols concentration was sampled by the CPC at the mouth of the susceptible victim. The experiments were repeated at least 25 times under identical conditions. Since the emission was transient and breathing was a periodic function, repeated experimental runs allowed a more practical way for analysis; results of the most frequent range of concentration level (the mode) were used.\r\n A new parameter was defined to facilitate comparison of effects of pulmonary ventilation on dose under both steady and episodic emission. To facilitate comparison between different data sets, the data were normalized by the background level in the non-breath scenario, defined as:\r\n where B and NB represent breath and non-breath, respectively.\r\n Prior to commencing measurements, the experimental setup was tested, particularly for the breathing circuit. In this regard, the system was tested with and without implementation of the breathing system. To avoid unnecessary uncertainty, the test was done under a steady state environment. Pulmonary ventilation of 7 LPM was utilized. Without any aerosol emission, the background level inside the environmental chamber was maintained at approximately 4000 numbers\/cc and this could be regarded as a constant source (Fig. 3) . The area under the concentration-time profile represents the exposure (referred to as scaled inhalation dose) and it was used to normalize the experimental data to get the BNB ratio, as shown in Eq. (2) . The dashed line shows the periodic pattern caused by the breathing cycle. During inhalation cycle, the concentration level was comparable to that without breathing. During exhalation, as expected, the profile exhibits a very sharp dip. However, the profile shows distinct differences between inhalation and exhalation cycles.\r\n To address the issue, concentration profiles for three breathing rates, 7 LPM, 15 LPM and 23 LPM, with the same breathing frequency, were measured (Fig. 4) ; the BNB is tabulated in Table 1 . These profiles are compared with the ideal breathing pattern with the same breathing frequency and the BNB ratio (Fig. 5) .\r\n Based on the results obtained from Figs the result was a BNB ratio of 1. This indicates that the inhalation process does not influence the measured concentration. The profiles exhibit almost a vertical drop during exhalation cycle and the rate increasing with breathing rate. Nevertheless, no profile was observed dropping to the \"theoretical\" zero BNB. This is a distinct difference between the experiments and the ideal pattern which can be plausibly attributed to limitations of the setup. Some constraints related to the experimental setup caused the ideal concentration profile (Fig. 5) to be unattainable. In the breathing circuit, a common path was used for inhalation and exhalation (Fig. 2, Path C) . Although the tubing was kept short, finite time was still required for the filtered air to purge the entire tubing. Thus a certain fraction of particles were retained inside the tube, leading to non-zero concentration during exhalation. Higher breathing rates led to higher purging rates in tubing and hence, fewer particles were retained inside the tube; concentration level dropped further. Comparison of Figs. 4 and 5 shows that the higher the breathing rate, the better the results match with the ideal breathing pattern. Table 1 also confirms that the BNB ratio is inversely proportional to pulmonary ventilation. They may be regarded as a limitation for estimation the dose during breathing. In spite of this constraint, it is believed that it did not affect results of episodic emission shown below.\r\n Besides unattainability of the zero BNB ratio, it is also interesting to notice that temporal profiles for inhalation and exhalation are not symmetrical. During inhalation, all profiles are more steady and last for more than 2 s, while during exhalation, less steady profiles are observed and the holding time was less than 2 s. This can be attributed to the dynamic behavior of motorized valves as it takes finite time for them to open and close mechanically. More experiments to measure the dynamic properties of valves are required to confirm the hypothesis. Inferring from the results shown in Fig. 4 , the inhalation period of 2.5 s and the exhalation period of 1.5 s were assumed hereafter. In fact, with such modifications, the results are found to be matching better with the breathing pattern. \r\n The source manikin emitted droplets towards the BTM (60 cm). Two emission velocities were tested and the whole expiratory process lasted for 2 s. Fig. 6 shows a concentration profile for nonbreathing condition for emission velocity of 15 m\/s. It increased steadily and reached the peak at approximately 2.3 s, and then decayed; the entire process lasted approximately 4 s. A similar profile was observed for emission velocity of 30 m\/s. They were both used as benchmarks for comparison with concentration profiles with breathing.\r\n For the transient condition, a similar breath to non-breath ratio was defined to parameterize the effect on application of the breathing circuit. It is defined as Breath to non-breath (BNB) ratio = \u221e 0 (C B (t) \u2212 C B,BG (t))dt \u221e 0 (C NB (t) \u2212 C NB,BG (t))dt (3) where BG represents the background concentration of the experimental trial.\r\n Most of the experiments were conducted under transient expiratory emission with periodic breathing. Compared to the steady concentration environment, data interpretation for the temporal concentration profile was not straightforward and needed further elaboration. Fig. 7 shows a typical histogram of 25 measurements of concentration taken under identical conditions. Breathing and concentration of the approaching aerosol cloud were both unsteady; the moment when the aerosol enters the physical boundary of the mouth determines the ultimate concentration that enters the physical boundary through the mouth. Hence, distinct concentration levels were observed. In this regard, concentration levels were divided into different bins and the frequency of occurrence was counted for each bin. The results were stochastic but followed a normal-like distribution.\r\n There were two extreme cases, depending on the moment when the aerosol cloud reached the mouth, whether it started inhalation or exhalation. For the former, aerosols can enter the respiratory system while for the latter, no aerosol can cross the physical boundary (see Figs. 3 and 4) . Summarizing all experimental results, two types of concentration profiles, single peak and double peak, were observed. Fig. 6(a) and (b) shows concentration profiles with emission velocity of 15 m\/s under the condition of 15 LPM pulmonary ventilation together with a measured concentration without breathing. To plausibly explain the characteristics of the profiles, possible breathing cycle at the mouth was added.\r\n As explained above, there was evidence to show the existence of \"lagging\" response of the motorized valves, i.e. the opening and closing times were different. Inferring from Fig. 4 , exhalation cycles lasted less than 2 s while inhalation cycles lasted longer than 2 s. Hence asymmetrical cycling time was adapted for Fig. 6 . The modified cycle of 2.5 s inhalation and 1.5 s of exhalation matches well with measured concentration profile. Fig. 6 (a) shows a single peak profile and the concentration starts to decline when the inhalation cycle begins. On the contrary, Fig. 6 (b) shows a double peak profile and it seems it was counter-intuitive as there was only one peak in the non-breath profile. It was attributed to occurrence of inhalation-exhalation during incoming of the aerosol cloud. The existence of the double peaks and the timing of decline and rise of peaks match very well with the breathing pattern. This shows that breathing can drastically alter the concentration profile (and concentration).\r\n Figs. 8 and 9 show the typical concentration profiles from the experimental run of 15 m\/s emission velocity, and pulmonary rate of 15 LPM, under the DIS scheme. In Fig. 8 , although each of the three measured concentration profiles show double peaks, the profiles are very different from each other as the second peak occurred at different times, early, middle and later. It is plausible to attribute this to interaction of the incoming aerosol plume with respect to the various instantaneously breathing cycles. The differential time from the first peak to the local minimum is shown in the figure and they are all approximately 1.5 s. This observation shows how the starting time of exhalation affects the ultimate concentration profile at the mouth. Similar observations were found in the MV scheme. Fig. 9 depicts another comparison between three concentration profiles sampled with active breathing and one profile without breathing. It can be observed that each peak was substantially higher than that without breathing, with the peak-to-peak ratio ranging from 1.3 to 1.6.\r\n Another interesting point is the behavior of the decay. Profiles with breathing were observed to have sharp dips at the beginning of the decay part but the decay slowed afterwards (see the insert in Fig. 9 ). This can be explained by commencement of the exhalation cycle, which accelerates the decay, whereas the beginning of the inhalation cycle leads to slower decay. This observation was very different from the profile of the non-breath system in which concentration drops gradually to the background level. Fig. 10 further quantifies effects of pulmonary ventilation on the decay. Three profiles of different pulmonary ventilations are shown in Fig. 10 . The insert in Fig. 10 shows the decay part of the profiles in detail; best-fitted exponential decay rates are shown. It shows distinctly that the higher the pulmonary ventilation, the faster the decay during exhalation would be.\r\n It should also be noted that different profile characteristics are exhibited and the most remarkable one is the existence of the second peak. Fig. 11 shows two concentration profiles of 15 m\/s emission velocity and pulmonary rate of 7 LPM under DIS scheme to illustrate how they influence on dose. It can be observed that when the double peak concentration profile (Trial 1) started to decline, concentration profile of the single peak (Trial 2) continued to rise. ventilation schemes. Owing to the large variation in concentration profiles (e.g., Fig. 7) , it can be seen that the ratio varies significantly when the breathing system is applied (for instance, see Fig. 11 ). Detailed comparison of Figs. 12 and 13 reveals that the maximum to minimum ratio increases with pulmonary ventilation, i.e. 2.9-6.4 times for 7 LPM to 23 LPM, respectively, for the MV scheme, and 1.6-1.9 times for the DIS scheme. The variation of ratio under the MV scheme is larger than the DIS scheme. Under the MV scheme (Fig. 12) , high-velocity, high-turbulence supply air disturbs the aerosol-laden jet from the expiratory source. Nevertheless, this would not be the case in the DIS scheme, where low-velocity airflow is not expected to disturb the aerosol-laden jet. Thus, the results under the MV scheme fluctuate more and a larger range of variation was caused. Fig. 14 summarizes BNB ratio for mode values for all tested scenarios. The ratio is inversely proportional to the pulmonary rate, regardless of the ventilation mode and emission velocity. This is attributed to the influence of the exhalation process. Under light physical activities where pulmonary ventilation equals 23 LPM, exhalation process plays a significant role in reducing the inhalation level. It overwhelms the enhanced inhalation in the process. The higher the breathing rate, the sharper the resultant drop of concentration would be, leading to lower the dose. However, it is possible that dose would be increased under very low and low pulmonary ventilation, where some results show BNB ratios higher than 100%. This may be attributed to the effect of dose reduction is smaller for very low and low pulmonary ventilation and, therefore, the reduction of dose caused by the exhalation process was not high enough, compared to the enhancement of the dose during inhalation. Besides, the BNB ratio under the MV scheme is lower Fig. 14. Breath to non-breath ratio of scenarios for the mode value. than that of the DIS scheme under the same emission velocity and pulmonary ventilation.\r\n Utilizing the current experimental setup can facilitate many detailed measurements to determine what parameters affect dose level. Nevertheless, due to some technical constraints, there were some limitations. Synchronization of the instant of the aerosol plume and the breathing cycle was not feasible and hence whether dose would be enhanced or reduced could not be predicted in advance. A more advanced electronic circuit is required. Furthermore, the current study focused only on ultrafine particles. However, the risk of exposure depends not only on emission speeds but also on the size of aerosols [30] . Estimation of dose in different aerosol size levels can be studied in the future.\r\n Research interest in a diverse range of fields in control and reduction of human-to-human transmission of airborne pathogens indoors has increased. Within the space of a few years, transportation of droplets exhaled indoors has become an important topic in aerosol science, building science and public health.\r\n The influence of breathing on estimation of inhalation level or exposure risk under expiratory process has not been studied previously. In this work, an experimental approach was adopted to investigate how breathing affects inhalation level under ventilated environments, in case of steady and episodic emission. Two thermal-regulated manikins were designed and fabricated one of which was made with regulated breathing function. A new parameter, breath to non-breath ratio, was defined to quantify the effect of breathing on concentration.\r\n Under a steady concentration environment, inhalation does not alter the concentration profile compared to non-breathing. On the contrary, the exhalation cycle leads to substantial reduction in concentration and the reduction increases with pulmonary rate.\r\n Inferring from the results obtained by mimicking an expiratory emission, it can be seen that the operation of the breathing system has a very substantial influence on the ultimate dose under episodic emission. Depending on whether the mouth is exhaling or inhaling when the aerosol cloud reaches it, concentration is smaller or larger than that without breathing. Although it is not a direct measurement of the amount of aerosol inhaled by the manikin, the results indicate how breathing affects the dose level.\r\n Under light-load pulmonary ventilation (23 LPM), the exhalation process plays a significant role in reducing the dose level. During an exhalation cycle, aerosol concentration decreases considerably and the effect of exhalation overwhelms the \"enhanced\" dose during the inhalation process. The higher the breathing rate, the sharper is the resultant decay of concentration, leading to lower dose. Most of the times, under low pulmonary ventilation, dose is increased, compared to non-breath situations.\r\n The MV scheme tends to lower the dose compared to the DIS scheme, and has a higher variation. Besides, the unidirectional airflow characteristics of the DIS scheme show small variations in results.","sha":"b908e5b09c2ce123eca5bfed0dd342c65fdc1fe6","publish_time":"2011-09-15","authors":"Poon, Carmen K.M.; Lai, Alvin C.K.","journal":"Journal of Hazardous Materials","doi":"10.1016\/j.jhazmat.2011.06.040","Title":"Journal of Hazardous Materials","H index":235.0,"transmission_indicator":true,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"After the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the new influenza strain H1N1, community preparedness for pandemics has been the focus of much interest and effort in recent years. Although still being debated, recent scientific data support the notion that pathogens can be transmitted by aerosols [2] [3] [4] . This approach completely ignores the influence of human-generated thermal plume effects on concentration profile, which has been reported to be an important factor affecting indoor concentration [6, 7] . Apart from this conventional sampling method, advancement of optical technology had led to more afford-0304-3894\/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Sampling devices are placed very near or at the nostrils and\/or mouth openings [9] . There have been some numerical studies simulating contaminant concentration around BTM. Recently a study reported transportation of passive and particulate contaminants in the vicinity of breathing area of a BTM [17] . Likewise, inhalation-induced airflow may increase the dose. Nevertheless there is no systematic study that has quantified the effects. A few of them have investigated exposure to expiratory process for studying the influence of different ventilations on aerosol dispersion and mixing [7, 20] ; contaminant dispersion in air cabin mock-up [21] ; aerosol emitted from a nurse or patient [22] ; difference in exposure by a continuous or single expiratory emission [23] ; orientation of source-to-receptor and different ventilation schemes of aerosol dispersion and removal [24] ; and performance of personalized ventilation [25] . Recent reviews have highlighted all parameters governing airborne infection in indoor environments [19, 29] . MV schemes are the most popular ventilation arrangement for commercial buildings. In schemes of this type, high-velocity cooled air is discharged through supply grills and warm air is expelled through return grills. To the best of authors' knowledge, there no study has quantified how pulmonary ventilation affects transient inhalation dose of BTM. A real-time particle counter was used to measure concentration at the mouth under steady and episodic events and interactions of movements of exhaled\/inhaled air with the droplets were carefully studied. The two manikins were located inside a full scale experimental chamber of dimensions 2.30 (L) \u00d7 2.25 (W) \u00d7 2.3 (H) m 3 . One is referred to as the \"source\" and the other as the \"susceptible victim.\" The indoor temperature was 24 \u00b1 0.5 \u2022 C.\r\n Two parameters were varied and studied in this work. The first one was pulmonary ventilation of the susceptible victim, set at 7 LPM, 15 LPM and 23 LPM. Each pathway is described in detail herein below. There were a total of six components in this path. In reality, non-deposited inhaled aerosols exhale out. The current approach simplified the problem but the objective of the current work was to investigate how breathing affects inhalation dose and hence the presence of exhalation aerosols does not affect the results. Both Path A and B were connected together through the equal Y connector. Dilute sodium chloride (NaCl) solution was stored in a small container attached to the spray gun. The on\/off electrical modulating valve governed by LabVIEW was used to control sneezing duration. The manual electrical modulating valve was used to control the flow rate of sneezing. The experiments were repeated at least 25 times under identical conditions. Pulmonary ventilation of 7 LPM was utilized. These profiles are compared with the ideal breathing pattern with the same breathing frequency and the BNB ratio (Fig. During inhalation, all profiles are more steady and last for more than 2 s, while during exhalation, less steady profiles are observed and the holding time was less than 2 s. This can be attributed to the dynamic behavior of motorized valves as it takes finite time for them to open and close mechanically. They were both used as benchmarks for comparison with concentration profiles with breathing. Hence, distinct concentration levels were observed. The results were stochastic but followed a normal-like distribution. 6(a) and (b) shows concentration profiles with emission velocity of 15 m\/s under the condition of 15 LPM pulmonary ventilation together with a measured concentration without breathing. The modified cycle of 2.5 s inhalation and 1.5 s of exhalation matches well with measured concentration profile. 6 (a) shows a single peak profile and the concentration starts to decline when the inhalation cycle begins. 9 depicts another comparison between three concentration profiles sampled with active breathing and one profile without breathing. Another interesting point is the behavior of the decay. This observation was very different from the profile of the non-breath system in which concentration drops gradually to the background level. 10 further quantifies effects of pulmonary ventilation on the decay. 11 shows two concentration profiles of 15 m\/s emission velocity and pulmonary rate of 7 LPM under DIS scheme to illustrate how they influence on dose. 12 and 13 reveals that the maximum to minimum ratio increases with pulmonary ventilation, i.e. 2.9-6.4 times for 7 LPM to 23 LPM, respectively, for the MV scheme, and 1.6-1.9 times for the DIS scheme. Thus, the results under the MV scheme fluctuate more and a larger range of variation was caused. This is attributed to the influence of the exhalation process. This may be attributed to the effect of dose reduction is smaller for very low and low pulmonary ventilation and, therefore, the reduction of dose caused by the exhalation process was not high enough, compared to the enhancement of the dose during inhalation. Breath to non-breath ratio of scenarios for the mode value. Nevertheless, due to some technical constraints, there were some limitations. A more advanced electronic circuit is required. Estimation of dose in different aerosol size levels can be studied in the future. In this work, an experimental approach was adopted to investigate how breathing affects inhalation level under ventilated environments, in case of steady and episodic emission. Depending on whether the mouth is exhaling or inhaling when the aerosol cloud reaches it, concentration is smaller or larger than that without breathing. Under light-load pulmonary ventilation (23 LPM), the exhalation process plays a significant role in reducing the dose level. The higher the breathing rate, the sharper is the resultant decay of concentration, leading to lower dose."},{"Unnamed: 0":57,"Unnamed: 0.1":57,"doc_id":"66a0a8c841cfe4653fa3e97394bd7d9aa4c8b21b","title":"Recognition of Mannosylated Ligands and Influenza A Virus by Human SP-D: Contributions of an Extended Site and Residue 343 \u2020 NIH Public Access Author Manuscript","abstract":"Surfactant protein D (SP-D) plays important roles in antiviral host defense. Although SP-D shows a preference for glucose\/maltose, the protein also recognizes D-mannose and a variety of mannoserich microbial ligands. This latter preference prompted an examination of the mechanisms of mannose recognition, particularly as they relate to high-mannose viral glycans. Trimeric neck +carbohydrate recognition domains from human SP-D (hNCRD) preferred alpha1-2 linked dimannose (DM) over the branched trimannose (TM) core, alpha1-3 or alpha1-6 DM, or D-mannose. Previous studies have shown residues flanking the carbohydrate binding site can fine-tune ligand recognition. A mutant with valine at 343 (R343V) showed enhanced binding to mannan relative to wild-type and R343A. No alteration in affinity was observed for D-mannose or for alpha1-3 or alpha1-6 linked DM; however, substantially increased affinity was observed for alpha1-2DM. Both proteins showed efficient recognition of linear and branched sub-domains of high-mannose glycans on carbohydrate microarrays, and R343V showed increased binding to a subset of the oligosaccharides. Crystallographic analysis of an R343V complex with 1,2-DM showed a novel mode of binding. The disaccharide is bound to calcium by the reducing sugar ring, and a stabilizing H-bond is formed between the 2-OH of the non-reducing sugar ring and Arg349. Although hNCRDs show negligible binding to influenza A virus (IAV), R343V showed markedly enhanced viral neutralizing activity. Hydrophobic substitutions for Arg343 selectively blocked binding of a monoclonal antibody (Hyb 246-05) that inhibits IAV binding activity. Our findings demonstrate an extended ligand binding site for mannosylated ligands and the significant contribution of the 343 side chain to specific recognition of multivalent microbial ligands, including high-mannose viral glycans.\r\n SP-D is an effector of antimicrobial host defense in the lung and at extrapulmonary sites of expression (1-5). Animals deficient in SP-D are more susceptible to pulmonary challenge with \u2020 This publication was made possible by Grant Number HL-44015 and HL-29594 (EC) from the National Institutes of Health","text_body":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6) , and intranasal administration of recombinant SP-D can protect wild-type mice from lethal challenge with Aspergillus fumigatus (7) . In addition, SP-D appears to play particularly important roles in the neutralization and clearance of viruses. Animals deficient in SP-D also show delayed clearance and heightened inflammatory responses to strains of influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (8, 9) . Clearance is selectively impaired for IAV strains reactive with SP-D in vitro (8) and can be rescued with recombinant SP-D or by transgenic overexpression of trimeric subunits of SP-D (8, 10) . Notably, specific polymorphisms in the human gene have been associated with enhanced inflammatory reactions and morbidity secondary to RSV (11) .\r\n SP-D is a member of a family of collagenous C-type lectins, and recognition of microorganisms by this collectin involves the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (1, 2) . Although SP-D is often characterized by its preference for glucose-containing sugars, such as maltose; human SP-D binds with only slightly lower affinity to D-mannose, readily binds to yeast mannan, and can be purified on mannose-Sepharose (12)(unpublished data). In addition, SP-D preferentially binds to specific serotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae and isolated lipopolysaccharides expressing mannose-rich O-antigens (13) .\r\n Interactions of SP-D with viruses are also predominantly mediated by interactions with asparagine-linked glycans expressed on viral envelope proteins (14) (15) (16) . In particular, SP-D shows calcium-dependent and sugar-sensitive interactions with IAV, RSV (9, 17) , human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (15) , rotaviruses (18) and the SARS coronavirus (16) . In the case of IAV, binding was localized to specific high-mannose glycans associated with the hemagglutinin (HA) (14) , while binding to HIV was localized to glycans on gp120 (15) . Subsequent studies have correlated SP-D reactivity with IAV in vitro, clearance in vivo, and delayed clearance in SP-D deficient mice with the presence or absence of specific glycans associated with the head of the HA (8, (19) (20) (21) (22) . For example, an IAV strain that is reactive with SP-D in vitro, show decreased clearance in SP-D deficient mice, while a strain that binds poorly to SP-D showed no alteration in clearance (8, 19, 20) . Although SP-D can also bind to glycans associated with the neuraminidase (14) , inhibitory effects on neuraminidase activity appear to primarily depend on steric interference as a consequence of binding to the HA (23) .\r\n Bovine serum collectins, probable evolutionary descendents of SP-D in ruminants, differ from SP-D in their affinities for various microbial ligands, including mannan and IAV; and CL-43 shows particularly high affinity for both these ligands (24, 25) . Notably, chimeras consisting of the N-terminal peptide and collagen domains of SP-D combined with the neck and CRD of bovine conglutinin show enhanced interactions with IAV, in part attributed to the greater IAV binding activities of the lectin domains (26, 27) . The ligand binding surfaces of the serum conglutinin and CL-43 diverge from SP-D at several locations, but are most notably characterized by insertions near the ligand binding site and by the substitution of valine or isoleucine for arginine at position 343. We have previously shown modest increases in antiviral activity with the insertions of RAK (or AAA) to resemble CL-43 (24) . Our recent studies have shown that residue 343 plays a critical role in mediating interactions of SP-D with phosphatidylinositol (PI), its major surfactant-associated ligand (28) , and with the core oligosaccharide domain of rough bacterial lipopolysaccharides (29) . In addition, earlier studies by Allen and coworkers demonstrated that a full-length human SP-D with valine at position 343 shows altered saccharide preferences with enhanced affinity for GlcNAc and certain other monosaccharide ligands (30) .\r\n In the present studies, we employed a combination of site directed mutagenesis, carbohydrate microarray studies, and crystallographic analysis to further study the contributions of the 343 side chain to ligand recognition by human SP-D. Our experiments demonstrate greatly enhanced anti-viral activity of R343V associated with utilization of a modified carbohydrate binding site for alpha1-2 linked mannoses, which are commonly displayed at the termini of asparagine-linked viral glycans. The findings indicate that the unique presence of arginine at position 343 in human SP-D greatly influences its ligand binding preferences.\r\n The pET-30a(+) vector, S-protein horseradish peroxidase (S-protein-HRP), and RosettaBlue competent cells were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Yeast mannan was from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Trimannose (methyl 3,6-Di-O-(\u03b1-D-mannopyranosyl)-\u03b1-Dmannopyranoside, M302500)), corresponding to the conserved trimannose core oligosaccharide of high-mannose viral glycans ( Figure 1A) , was from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc., (Toronto, Canada). All other mono-and disaccharides were the D-anomers and of the highest purity available from Sigma. Fatty acid free BSA (BAH66-0050) was from Equitech-Bio, Inc. (Kerrville, TX). Purified synthetic oligomers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc (Coralville, IA).\r\n The expression and characterization of the N-terminally tagged, trimeric human neck+CRD (NCRD) fusion proteins have been previously described (12, 24, 28, 31) . The use of bacterially expressed proteins is feasible because there are no known post-translational modifications within the human SP-D CRD or neck domains, which self-assemble in vitro as stable trimers with lectin activity (24, 32) .\r\n Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenenesis Kit (200521; Stratagene, LA Jolla, CA) and the hSP-D neck+CRD DNA as template. In particular, we performed site directed substitutions for arginine 343 within the CRD, as defined by numbering of the full length protein: valine (R343V), alanine (R343A), and lysine (R343K) (28) . Tagless NCRDs were generated by re-engineering the expression vector to delete the entirety of the fusion tag. Sequences were verified by automated sequencing of the entire coding sequence of the fusion protein. Glycerol stocks of transformed bacteria were stored in single-use aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C.\r\n RosettaBlue competent cells were transformed with the wild-type or mutant construct in pET-30a(+) vector, and expressed proteins were isolated from inclusion bodies (IBs) (28, 31) . After refolding and oligomerization, the fusion proteins were purified by nickel-affinity chromatography. Trimers were isolated by gel filtration chromatography on an AKTA system (24) . All proteins were isolated in similar yields with similarly low levels of endotoxin. The fusion proteins and tagless NCRDs showed the expected mobility on SDS-PAGE in the absence and presence of sulfhydryl reduction, as previously demonstrated for the wild-type protein (24) . Purified proteins were stored in small aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C.\r\n Binding of trimeric NCRD fusion proteins to yeast mannan was measured as previously described using the S-protein-HRP conjugate (24) . To determine the level of non-specific binding, 50 mM maltose was included as a competitor during the binding step. For competition assays, proteins were added to wells in the presence of various concentrations of competing inhibitors. The concentration of competitor (mM) required for 50% inhibition of binding (I 50 ) was calculated.\r\n Binding and competition data were analyzed using the ligand binding module in Sigmaplot 9.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Apparent dissociation constants for mannan were calculated by nonlinear regression of the saturation binding curves assuming a molecular mass of 66 kDa per trimeric fusion protein. Although it is not possible to calculate true dissociation constants or binding capacities with this type of assay, the analysis permits quantitative comparison of the binding properties of the homologous NCRD fusion proteins using unmodified ligands. All values are given as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) of at least three independent assays using at least two independent preparations of recombinant protein.\r\n GAPS II slides (Corning) were submerged in DMF containing 2% diisopropylethylamine and 0.5 mg\/mL maleimido-N-hydroxysuccinimide hexanoic acid for 14 h at room temperature. Functionalized slides were washed three times with methanol, dried and stored under an argon atmosphere. The high-mannose containing oligosaccharides have been synthesized as described before (33,34)( Figure 1B ). Compounds were dissolved in PBS with one molar equivalent TCEP to reduce disulfides. One nanoliter of the solution was printed onto each spot of the maleimide functionalized slides using an automated printing robot. Slides were incubated in a humid chamber to complete reaction for 24 h and stored in a dessicator until usage.\r\n Slides were washed with water and methanol, and quenched in 0.1% (v\/v) \u03b2-mercaptoethanol in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were blocked with 2.5% (w\/v) BSA in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, with 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM CaCl 2 for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice with buffer, and centrifuged for 5 min at 50 \u00d7 g at room temperature. Blocked slides were incubated with NCRD solutions (20 \u00b5g\/mL of NCRD in binding buffer: 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, with 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM CaCl 2 , 1% (w\/v) BSA and 0.5% (v\/v) Tween-20) or Concanavalin A (10 \u00b5g\/mL in binding buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. For inhibition, 50 \u00b5g\/mL yeast mannan (Sigma Aldrich), 125 mM maltose and 20 mM EDTA were added to binding buffer lacking calcium chloride. Incubated slides were washed twice with buffer, centrifuged and overlaid with 2 \u00b5g\/mL PENTA-HIS Alexa Fluor 555 antibody conjugate (Quiagen) in binding buffer in a similar fashion. After two washes and centrifugation, slides were scanned with a fluorescent microarray scanner (Tecan). Binding intensities were analyzed using microarray evaluation software (Genespotter, MicroDiscovery).\r\n For crystallographic analysis, the proteins were expressed as enterokinase-cleaved fusion proteins (31), or as NCRDs lacking the fusion tags (28, 31) . The latter begin with methionine, followed by the first residue of the natural neck domain. Tagless proteins were isolated by maltosyl-agarose affinity chromatography (12) prior to purification of trimers by gel filtration on Superose 12 in 150mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 10mM calcium chloride (HBSC). The trimer fractions were pooled and the protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration to approximately 15 mg\/ml prior to freezing at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Pierce, Rockford, Il) with BSA as standard. Purity was verified by SDS-PAGE and homogeneity was confirmed by dynamic light scattering using a 1mg\/ml solution in the above buffer.\r\n Crystals were prepared as previously described (28, 31) . D-mannose or alpha1,2 dimannose was soaked into crystals by dissolving the ligand in mother liquor and transferring a crystal into the soaking solution for a period of 1-2 hrs. After soaking, the crystal was flash frozen in a 100\u00b0K stream of nitrogen gas at the beamline. Data were collected at beamline X8C at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Lab, and processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (35) . Data collection statistics are shown in the Results. Model building and structure refinement were performed using O (36), Phenix (37), CNS (38) and REFMAC (39) . R343V crystals belong to the same space group with a similar unit cell as the wild type protein. However, these crystals were found to exhibit pseudomerohedral twinning. The twinning operator (l, -k, h) and twin fraction (0.482) were determined using xtriage (Phenix), and the structure refined in Phenix,\r\n The Phil82 strain of IAV was grown and isolated as previously described. Binding of NCRD fusion proteins to solid-phase IAV, hemagglutination inhibition assays, and fluorescent focus assays of viral neutralization were performed as described in recent publications (24) .\r\n Monoclonal antibodies were originally prepared by Holmskov and coworkers using purified human SP-D as antigen (40) . Binding of antibody to non-NCRDs and NCRD mutants was characterized by an ELISA-type binding assay (41) . Proteins were adsorbed to wells without prior denaturation.\r\n In conjunction with earlier experiments examining interactions of SP-D with PI, we observed that substitutions at the 343 position could substantially and differentially alter the apparent affinity for fungal mannan. For example, substitution of lysine for Arg343 (R343K) greatly increased binding to PI and E. coli J5 or Rd-LPS, while largely abrogating binding to mannan (28, 29) . By contrast, the substitution of valine for Arg343 (R343V) showed little effect on binding to PI or LPS. However, the apparent affinity for R343V for mannan was increased by 2 to 3-fold ( Figure 2A ). These effects were highly dependent on the specific hydrophobic side chain. Notably, the substitution of alanine (or isoleucine) resulted in a more modest enhancement in mannan binding (Figure 2A , data not shown).\r\n Despite these effects, R343V showed no significant increase in affinity for D-mannose ( Figure  2B ). This observation is consistent with the fact that residues corresponding to 343 do not coordinate calcium in SP-D or other C-type lectins (42) (43) (44) . Further, Arg343 of human SP-D does not participate in H-bonding interactions with inositol or the preferred monosaccharide ligand, N-acetyl-mannosamine (28) .\r\n Our recent studies have shown that SP-D can interact with specific larger oligosaccharides via an extended carbohydrate binding site, i.e., a binding site that provides secondary interactions with the side chains of amino acids that do not provide calcium ligands (31) . We examined binding of hNCRDs with mannose disaccharides (dimannose, DM) and a 1-methyl derivative (Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man-\u03b1-OMe-) of the trimannose (TM) core of highmannose glycans. The hNCRD showed a reproducible, approximately 2-fold higher affinity for alpha1-2 linked DM and the TM core than for mannose ( Figure 3 ) Both differences were highly significant (p<0.001). The affinities for alpha1-3 and alpha1-6 DM were also increased relative to mannose, but to a significantly lesser degree. The affinity for alpha1-2 linked DM was also significantly greater than for alpha1-6 DM (p < 0.02). Although the affinity of the wild-type hNCRD for the TM core (1.6 \u00b1 0.15 mM, n=3) was increased relative to D-mannose (3.8 mM), the affinity was less than observed for maltotriose, a linear glucose trisaccharide (I 50 = 0.94 \u00b1 0.08 mM, n=11) (31) .\r\n As shown in Figure 3 , mutations at the 343 position altered the apparent affinity for specific mannose-containing carbohydrates. In particular, R343V showed a 7-fold increase in affinity for alpha1-2 DM (I 50 =210 \u00b1 60 \u00b5M, n=5), as compared to wild-type. In one experiment, R343A showed a similar but less marked increase in affinity (I 50 =362 \u00b5M). R343K also showed a detectable increase in affinity for alpha1-2 DM (I 50 = 552 \u00b1 35 \u00b5M, average of 3 determinations); however, this finding must be interpreted with some caution given the markedly lower levels of total binding of R343K mannan.\r\n Ligand binding preferences of wild-type hNCRD and R343V were examined in array experiments using a small panel of mannoses, mannose-rich oligosaccharides, and selected other simple sugars covalently linked to the slide ( Figure 1B and Figure 4) . A selected assay for several independent experiments is shown. Uniformity of ligand printing was verified using ConA binding, as described in the Methods section. Equivalent retention of the N-terminal His-tags was reconfirmed in control immunoblotting experiments (data not shown).\r\n Both fusion proteins bound to known saccharide competitors, maltotriose (ligand 14) and Dmannose (7). However, there was no reproducible binding to D-galactose (16) , which is a poor competitor of SP-D binding to mannan and other ligands. Binding of hNCRDs to the arrays was inhibited by maltose, mannan, or mannan plus EDTA. Notably, a human loss-of-function mutant (E321K) with a point mutation at Glu321 and abnormal coordination of calcium at the sugar binding site consistently showed negligible binding to all ligands ( Figure 4) .\r\n The proteins showed preferential recognition of long linear and branched mannose oligosaccharides as compared to D-mannose (ligand 7). The best ligand for the wild-type protein was the alpha1-2 linked mannose trisaccharide (ligand 4, Man\u03b11-2Man\u03b11-2Man-). However, binding was increased to the high-mannose nonasaccharide (1), hexamannose (2) , and the alpha1-6-linked TM (6, Man\u03b11-6Man\u03b11-6Man-). Interestingly, binding to the trimannose core (3) was not appreciably increased as compared to mannose (7) , and binding to all of the oligomannoses was greater than maltotriose (14) , a classical SP-D ligand.\r\n The binding profile of R343V was generally similar to the wild-type protein. There was preferential binding to the alpha1-2 linked mannose trisaccharide (ligand 4), high-mannose nonsaccharide (1), and hexamannose (2) (Figure 4 ). Relative binding to hexamannose (2) and a tetramannose arm of the nonamannose (5), Man\u03b11-2Man\u03b11-6Man\u03b11-6Man-, were greater for the mutant (Figure 4 ). Although variability in absolute fluorescence intensities precluded direct, quantitative comparisons among individual binding experiments, the differences in the rank ordering of binding to specific ligands was reproducible.\r\n Given the binding data, we examined complexes of tagless wild-type and mutant hNCRDs with \u03b11-2 linked dimannose (DM) using x-ray crystallography ( Figure 5 ; Table 1 ). Crystal structures of the trimeric NCRD complexes were obtained at 1.8A and 2.3A resolution for wild-type or R343V proteins, respectively.\r\n The ligand was bound to the lectin calcium ion of wild-type hNCRD via the 3-OH and 4-OH groups of the non-reducing, terminal sugar in the same manner as \u03b1-methyl-D-mannose ( Figure  5A,B) . The dimannose showed the same orientation with respect to the plane of the ring of Man1. While strong electron density is observed for Man 1 in all subunits, density for Man 2 is weaker in subunits B and C of the NCRD trimer. Notably, \u03b11-2-DM showed additional weak interactions of Man1 O2 with Asp325, and an interaction of Man2 with Arg343 in subunit B, consistent with differences in affinity in competition assays.\r\n R343V showed very different interactions with the dimannose ( Figure 5C) . Notably, the binding orientation of the \u03b11-2DM was reversed, with the reducing sugar bound to Ca1. This orientation was stabilized by a strong H-bond between the 2-OH of the non-reducing Man1 and the guanidyl group of R349. In subunit A of the trimer (shown in Figure 5C ) an additional H-bond was formed between the 6-OH of Man1 and the carboxylate of E347. In subunit B a similar interaction was mediated by a water molecule. Similar orientations were observed in all three subunits. Superimposition of \u03b11-2DM from the mutant and wild-type complexes showed very little difference in torsional bond angles ( Figure 6 ).\r\n Consistent with previous studies, wild type hNCRD showed no measurable binding to Phil82 IAV as assessed by solid phase binding assay (Figure 7 )(15), despite efficient binding to mannan. The wild type trimeric hNCRD also lacked hemagglutination inhibition ( Table 2 ) or neutralizing activity (Figure 8, right panel) . Significantly, R343V, and to a lesser extent R343A, bound to virus (Figure 7) . The valine mutant also showed greatly increased HA inhibitory ( Table 2 ) and neutralizing activity (Figure 8, left panel) . Strikingly, neutralizing activity was in a range previously associated with native collectins, and much greater than the previously characterized RAK mutant. Although neutralizing activity was still less than native SP-D dodecamers (Figure 8, left panel) , it was greater than native human mannose binding protein (data not shown). Despite marked increases in binding of R343V to Phil82 IAV, there was no alteration in binding or neutralization of PR8 (data not shown), an SP-D resistant strain that lacks high-mannose glycans on the head of the HA. R343A showed a much smaller increase in hemagglutination inhibition ( Table 2) . Although R343A showed no neutralizing activity at the same concentrations as used for R343V, doserelated neutralizing activity was observed at considerably higher protein concentrations (Figure 8, right panel) . The R343K mutant showed no significant binding (data not shown) and no detectable hemagglutination inhibition ( Table 2 ) or neutralizing activity (Figure 8) ), despite its greatly enhanced interactions with PI and inositol (28) , as well as rough LPS (29) .\r\n To further characterize the effects of the mutations on CRD structure, we examined the binding of the 343 mutants to selected monoclonal antibodies (246-02, 246-05 and 246-6) known to react with the SP-D CRD (40) . All three monoclonals bound to wild type SP-D dodecamers (not shown) and to hNCRDs (Figure 9, panel A) . However, there were differential interactions of the antibodies with the 343 mutants. Although 246-02 bound to all three mutants and 246-06 show some decrease in binding, binding of 246-05 was largely abrogated by the substitution of valine or alanine for Arg343. The more conservative R343K mutation caused a less pronounced reduction of binding to 246-05. As shown in Panels B & C, the 246-02 and 246-05 mAbs blocked HA inhibitory activity of SP-D, while 246-06 did not. Although 246-02 blocked the HA inhibitory activity of R343V, 246-05 was ineffective, consistent with poor binding of the antibody to this mutant.\r\n SP-D is often identified as a D-glucose or maltose binding protein. However, our recent studies identified N-acetyl-mannosamine as a preferred monosaccharide competitor for the human protein (12) , and interactions with the core oligosaccharide of rough LPS are largely mediated by interactions with heptoses, D-mannose sugars with a side chain at the 5-position. The current studies demonstrate a significant preference of SP-D for mannose-rich sugars, including highmannose oligosaccharides as associated with viral glycans. When presented on a solid-phase, as might be encountered on a microbial surface, all the oligomannoses were preferred over maltotriose, an \u03b11-4-linked trisaccharide of D-glucose.\r\n We have previously shown that Phe335, Thr336, Asn337, and Arg343 can participate in an extended sugar binding site, in which the side chains of residues that do not coordinate calcium provide secondary stabilizing interactions with non-terminal sugars (31) . As indicated above, small peptide insertions (e.g. Ala-Ala-Ala) adjoining Asp325, a residue found on the opposite ridge of the shallow carbohydrate groove, can significantly enhance interactions with mannan and IAV (17) , but have little effect on binding to rough LPS or PI (28, 29) .\r\n As shown here, dimannoses can make additional contacts with Asp325 and\/or Arg 343, which are not seen in the mannose monomer, consistent with the greater affinity for these sugars over mannose in solution-phase competition assays. We propose that these secondary interactions contribute to the enhanced binding of the trimeric hNCRD to linear and branched mannose rich oligosaccharides and high-mannose glycans, as compared to identically displayed mannose. Preferential binding of the wild-type protein to the linear \u03b11-2 linked trimannose (ligand #4), as compared to a tetramannose with the same terminal disaccharide (5), is consistent with secondary interactions and\/or other significant effects of non-terminal sugars on binding affinity. Combined with previously reported observations (12, 28, 29) , these studies indicate that different SP-D ligands can utilize distinct, but partially overlapping binding sites. This seems consistent with the diversity of known microbial ligands.\r\n We cannot entirely exclude differences between the NCRD and a full length mutant protein.\r\n However, previous studies indicate the specificity of rat and human wild-type NCRDs is concordant with the specificity of the corresponding full-length proteins (12) .\r\n Substitution of Arg343 with valine greatly enhanced binding to \u03b11-2 DM in competition assays. This was quite selective for the \u03b11-2 linkage; there was no significant increase in affinity for \u03b11-3 and \u03b11-6 dimannoses or the trimannose core in competition assays. Comparison crystallographic complexes of wild type and R343V with \u03b11-2 DM showed that the sugar ring conformations and geometry of the saccharide linkage were highly similar in the two complexes ( Figure 6 ) and consistent with the preferred solution conformation. However, the orientation of the bound disaccharide was very different in the two complexes. Whereas the wild-type protein bound \u03b11-2 DM in the more typical orientation, i.e., with the non-reducing terminal sugar bound to calcium, the binding orientation of the dimannose was flipped in R343V. In this alternate orientation, the reducing sugar is bound to calcium, while the terminal sugar participates in a strong H-bond with another conserved residue, Arg349. This flipped orientation has not been previously described for SP-D. However, we infer that loss of the Arg343 side chain increases steric access of oligosaccharides to the primary sugar binding site, while permitting additional H-bonding interactions with residues even more remote from this site. We cannot yet prove that this alternative binding orientation can be utilized by a solid-phase oligosaccharide. However, the alternate orientation, which is selected by R343V, should permit interactions with non-terminal mannoses of more complex glycans. For example, the alternate would position the reducing sugar of a linear trimannose or the corresponding internal residue of a high mannose glycan in the region of Asp325. This region has been previously implicated in interactions with mannan and IAV (24) . Thus, these observations offer a possible structural basis for the distinct binding preferences and enhanced interactions with high-mannose oligosaccharides exhibited by R343V as compared with wildtype SP-D.\r\n The mutant showed increased binding to IAV as well as enhanced HA inhibition (HAI) and neutralization of infectivity using MDCK cells. As indicated previously, the wild-type protein shows no detectable IAV binding and negligible HAI or viral neutralization in these same cells. These findings are consistent with data from collectin chimeras which suggested greater affinity of the conglutinin and mannan binding lectin CRDs for collectin-sensitive strains of IAV (19, 20) . Notably, both of these serum collectins have valine at the position corresponding to 343. Because the affinity for D-mannose was not significantly altered for these proteins, we attribute their enhanced binding to additional secondary interactions with the IAV oligomannoses. The available data strongly suggest that the valine side chain contributes to the enhanced recognition of viral glycans. In particular, the SP-D mutants R343A and R343I showed significantly lower viral binding, HAI, and neutralizing activity than R343V. R343K also showed no detectable binding to IAV. The reason for these differences is not yet apparent. Our inference is that the valine substitution eliminates the bulky Arg343 side chain, allowing the second sugar ring to make additional interactions with the Arg349 side chain. The longer isoleucine and lysine side chains could impose similar steric constraints as arginine, while the short alanine side chain might permit alteration of local backbone properties, leading to other functional consequences. Future crystallographic studies of these mutants should resolve these questions. Studies designed to examine the antiviral properties of R343V in vivo are in progress.\r\n The related human collectin, Surfactant protein A, has arginine at the position corresponding to arginine 343 in SP-D. It is not yet possible to generalize in relation to effects on interactions with mannose containing oligosaccharides. Our previous studies have shown that SP-A shows little if any binding to virus; antiviral effects are mediated by binding of virus to glycans associated with SP-A.\r\n Monoclonal antibody binding studies suggest that substitutions at 343 cause only localized perturbations in structure. This suggestion is consistent with the crystallographic analysis of R343V. Interestingly, the substitution of valine or alanine preferentially decreased binding of the 246-05 monoclonal, while the comparatively conservative lysine substitution caused a more modest decrease in antibody binding. Given that R343V shows enhanced viral binding and blocks the viral neutralizing activity of 246-05, our data effectively localize the 246-05 epitope and the primary site of viral interaction to the carbohydrate binding face of the trimer. We infer that binding of 246-05 sterically interferes with SP-D binding to glycans associated with the viral envelope.\r\n The wild type hNCRD showed preferential binding to \u03b11-2 linked mannose, and most of the high mannose oligosaccharide sub-domains on the array have at least one terminal \u03b11-2 linked mannose. This feature is not required for efficient oligomannose binding, as indicated by recognition of the linear \u03b11-6 trimannose (ligand #6) on the array studies.\r\n All available hNCRD mutants with enhanced affinity for IAV show increased apparent affinity for mannan, and nearly all show increased affinity for \u03b11-2 DM. However, the extent of binding to mannan binding does not directly correlate with effectiveness in viral binding or neutralization. For example, a mutant that combines the RAK insertion with isoleucine at 343, resembling CL-43, shows a greater apparent affinity for mannan relative to R343V, but is less active in viral neutralization (Hartshorn and coworkers, unpublished data) . Yeast mannan consists of highly extended and branched polysaccharides with \u03b11-2 and \u03b11-3 linked mannose residues on a \u03b11-6 linked mannose backbone. Thus, there could be differential access of branched carbohydrates to the lectin calcium, which might lead to exclusion of specific types of sugar linkages or branched structures and differences in effective ligand density.\r\n Although terminal \u03b11-2 linked mannose may be necessary for binding of the hNCRD to virus, it is unlikely to be sufficient. For example, the rat NCRD resembles R343V in its high affinity for \u03b11-2 DM, but resembles the wild-type hNCRD with respect to viral binding and neutralization (Hartshorn and coworkers, data not shown).\r\n Our data suggest that the enhanced antiviral activity of R343V results from its capacity to recognize non-terminal sugars of more complex glycans. Given the crystallographicallyobserved orientation of bound \u03b11-2DM, such interactions could involve the region of 325.\r\n Unpublished studies indicate that viral interactions and effects of 343 substitutions are greatly influenced by the nature of the 325 side chain and the conformation of the opposite side of the carbohydrate binding groove. Planned crystallographic studies with trimannoses and other dimannose ligands should contribute to understanding these synergistic effects.\r\n Because R343V also shows enhanced recognition of \u03b1-linked GlcNAc (30) , it is possible that contributions of more complex glycans also may influence binding. Thus, additional information of the specific linkage patterns on examined strains of IAV will also be needed to fully integrate the data.\r\n Human SP-D is uniquely characterized by arginine at position 343; all other SP-Ds have lysine, while evolutionary descendents of SP-D have valine or isoleucine. We have previously shown that the substitution of lysine for arginine can greatly enhance the apparent affinity of human SP-D lectin domains for PI, the major surfactant ligand, and for forms of rough bacterial LPS (28, 29) . However, there is no associated enhancement of viral interactions (data not shown) and binding to yeast mannan is abrogated (28, 29) . On the other hand, substitutions of shorter, non charged amino acids (Ala, Ile, Val) for Arg343 increase binding to mannan and interactions with SP-D sensitive strains influenza, but do not enhance binding to PI or rough LPS (28, 29) . Thus, the presence of a long basic side chain at 343 in human SP-D plays a substantial role in determining relative ligand preferences, greatly decreasing affinity of the lectin domain for the major known endogenous airspace ligand, while preserving interactions with specific mannose-or heptose-rich ligands.\r\n We speculate that the need for some specific antimicrobial defense or immunomodulatory function contributed to evolutionary divergence of human SP-D at the 343 position. Although SP-D reactive strains of IAV have only recently emerged (45) , other pathogens have evolved and disseminated with humans. For example, genomic analysis of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex suggests that the world-wide dissemination of this organism closely parallels the spread of humans from Africa (46) . SP-D interacts with mannose-rich glycoconjugates on certain mycobacteria (47, 48) and specific polymorphic forms of SP-D appear to be associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis (49) . Mycobacteria are also significant pathogens for ruminants, and could have similarly contributed to evolution of bovine serum collectins from SP-D.\r\n It is important to emphasize that some ligand interactions of SP-D can be substantially influenced by higher-order oligomeric assembly. Like hNCRDs, native human SP-D trimers bind poorly to IAV; however, wild-type human SP-D multimers, like rat SP-D dodecamers, show efficient binding and neutralization (12, 50) . Likewise, SP-D dodecamers can bind efficiently to PI liposomes, even though the hNCRDs and native trimeric subunits bind poorly (31) . Given that all the examined glycans are too small to engage more than one CRD of a trimer, preferential binding to longer linear or branched oligosaccharides might result from cooperative interactions among the CRDs of a trimer, but with each CRD showing only incremental increases in binding affinity as a result of secondary interactions at the ligand binding surface. On the other hand, a more complex ligand could also provide more opportunities for energetically favorable binding at any given ligand density. Planned studies comparing the interactions of wild-type and mutant dodecamers should be informative. A) Binding to mannan. Trimeric hNCRD fusion proteins were incubated with mannan coated plates as described in the Methods. Bound protein was detected using an S-protein peroxidase conjugate as previously described. Specific binding of the wild type hNCRD is compared to mutant hNCRDs with substitutions of valine (R343V) or alanine (R343A) for Arg343. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting binding in the presence of maltose from total binding. Non-specific binding was <10% for all proteins. The data are representative of five experiments. B) Mannose competition assay. The ability of saccharides to compete for binding of NCRD fusion proteins to mannan was performed as described in the Methods. The concentration required to inhibit binding by 50% is shown.\r\n A) Representative competition assay. Mannan competition assays were performed using hNCRD, R343V, R343A, and R343K as described in the Methods. B) Histogram comparing apparent affinities of hNCRD and R343V fusion proteins. The concentration of competing sugar (mM) required to inhibit binding to mannan by 50% (I50) is shown. The data represent the mean and standard error of the mean from 3-10 independent determinations except for alpha1-3-DM which corresponds to a single assay.

Binding of hNCRD fusion proteins was assessed using PENTA-HIS Alexa Fluor 555 antibody conjugate as described in the Methods. Solid-phase carbohydrates are illustrated in Figure  1B . A selected experiment is shown. The alpha1-2 dimannoses from the corresponding hNCRD and R343V crystallographic complexes were superimposed. Note that the conformations are very similar. Trimeric hNCRD fusion proteins were incubated with Phil82 IAV virus coated plates and bound protein was detected as described in the Methods. Note the greatly increased binding of R343V and the more modest increase for R343A.\r\n Wild type and mutant hNCRDs were examined for viral neutralization using Phil82 IAV as described in the Methods. The data in both graphs are expressed as the percent of control infectious foci. Note that the range of protein concentration is different for the two graphs; the plot at left is ng\/ml, while the plot at right is in \u00b5g\/ml. R343V is much more potent than the other examined hNCRDs.\r\n A) Binding of monoclonals to solid phase wild-type and mutant hNCRDs was examined by ELISA as described in the Methods.

In particular, SP-D shows calcium-dependent and sugar-sensitive interactions with IAV, RSV (9, 17) , human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (15) , rotaviruses (18) and the SARS coronavirus (16) . Subsequent studies have correlated SP-D reactivity with IAV in vitro, clearance in vivo, and delayed clearance in SP-D deficient mice with the presence or absence of specific glycans associated with the head of the HA (8, (19) (20) (21) (22) . In addition, earlier studies by Allen and coworkers demonstrated that a full-length human SP-D with valine at position 343 shows altered saccharide preferences with enhanced affinity for GlcNAc and certain other monosaccharide ligands (30) . The pET-30a(+) vector, S-protein horseradish peroxidase (S-protein-HRP), and RosettaBlue competent cells were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Purified synthetic oligomers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc (Coralville, IA). Tagless NCRDs were generated by re-engineering the expression vector to delete the entirety of the fusion tag. Sequences were verified by automated sequencing of the entire coding sequence of the fusion protein. Glycerol stocks of transformed bacteria were stored in single-use aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C. Binding of trimeric NCRD fusion proteins to yeast mannan was measured as previously described using the S-protein-HRP conjugate (24) . To determine the level of non-specific binding, 50 mM maltose was included as a competitor during the binding step. Although it is not possible to calculate true dissociation constants or binding capacities with this type of assay, the analysis permits quantitative comparison of the binding properties of the homologous NCRD fusion proteins using unmodified ligands. All values are given as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) of at least three independent assays using at least two independent preparations of recombinant protein. Functionalized slides were washed three times with methanol, dried and stored under an argon atmosphere. Compounds were dissolved in PBS with one molar equivalent TCEP to reduce disulfides. One nanoliter of the solution was printed onto each spot of the maleimide functionalized slides using an automated printing robot. Slides were incubated in a humid chamber to complete reaction for 24 h and stored in a dessicator until usage. Slides were blocked with 2.5% (w\/v) BSA in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, with 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM CaCl 2 for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice with buffer, and centrifuged for 5 min at 50 \u00d7 g at room temperature. Incubated slides were washed twice with buffer, centrifuged and overlaid with 2 \u00b5g\/mL PENTA-HIS Alexa Fluor 555 antibody conjugate (Quiagen) in binding buffer in a similar fashion. Binding intensities were analyzed using microarray evaluation software (Genespotter, MicroDiscovery). For crystallographic analysis, the proteins were expressed as enterokinase-cleaved fusion proteins (31), or as NCRDs lacking the fusion tags (28, 31) . Purity was verified by SDS-PAGE and homogeneity was confirmed by dynamic light scattering using a 1mg\/ml solution in the above buffer. Crystals were prepared as previously described (28, 31) . After soaking, the crystal was flash frozen in a 100\u00b0K stream of nitrogen gas at the beamline. Data were collected at beamline X8C at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Lab, and processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (35) . Data collection statistics are shown in the Results. Model building and structure refinement were performed using O (36), Phenix (37), CNS (38) and REFMAC (39) . However, these crystals were found to exhibit pseudomerohedral twinning. Monoclonal antibodies were originally prepared by Holmskov and coworkers using purified human SP-D as antigen (40) . Proteins were adsorbed to wells without prior denaturation. By contrast, the substitution of valine for Arg343 (R343V) showed little effect on binding to PI or LPS. These effects were highly dependent on the specific hydrophobic side chain. Further, Arg343 of human SP-D does not participate in H-bonding interactions with inositol or the preferred monosaccharide ligand, N-acetyl-mannosamine (28) . The affinities for alpha1-3 and alpha1-6 DM were also increased relative to mannose, but to a significantly lesser degree. In particular, R343V showed a 7-fold increase in affinity for alpha1-2 DM (I 50 =210 \u00b1 60 \u00b5M, n=5), as compared to wild-type. A selected assay for several independent experiments is shown. Both fusion proteins bound to known saccharide competitors, maltotriose (ligand 14) and Dmannose (7). Notably, a human loss-of-function mutant (E321K) with a point mutation at Glu321 and abnormal coordination of calcium at the sugar binding site consistently showed negligible binding to all ligands ( Figure 4) . However, binding was increased to the high-mannose nonasaccharide (1), hexamannose (2) , and the alpha1-6-linked TM (6, Man\u03b11-6Man\u03b11-6Man-). In subunit A of the trimer (shown in Figure 5C ) an additional H-bond was formed between the 6-OH of Man1 and the carboxylate of E347. Although R343A showed no neutralizing activity at the same concentrations as used for R343V, doserelated neutralizing activity was observed at considerably higher protein concentrations (Figure 8, right panel) . However, there were differential interactions of the antibodies with the 343 mutants. The more conservative R343K mutation caused a less pronounced reduction of binding to 246-05. As shown in Panels B & C, the 246-02 and 246-05 mAbs blocked HA inhibitory activity of SP-D, while 246-06 did not. Preferential binding of the wild-type protein to the linear \u03b11-2 linked trimannose (ligand #4), as compared to a tetramannose with the same terminal disaccharide (5), is consistent with secondary interactions and\/or other significant effects of non-terminal sugars on binding affinity. Comparison crystallographic complexes of wild type and R343V with \u03b11-2 DM showed that the sugar ring conformations and geometry of the saccharide linkage were highly similar in the two complexes ( Figure 6 ) and consistent with the preferred solution conformation. This flipped orientation has not been previously described for SP-D. However, we infer that loss of the Arg343 side chain increases steric access of oligosaccharides to the primary sugar binding site, while permitting additional H-bonding interactions with residues even more remote from this site. For example, the alternate would position the reducing sugar of a linear trimannose or the corresponding internal residue of a high mannose glycan in the region of Asp325.

Quantitative culture of maternal and fetal tissues as well as histopathologic examination of the placenta were performed.\r\n We have characterized a rat model of maternal and fetal infection that can be manipulated by alteration of infectious dose. Colonization of Sprague-Dawley rat dam and fetal tissues by M pulmonis occurred in a dose-dependent manner after intravenous inoculation (P \u03fd .001). Placental lesion severity increased with infection dose (P \u03ed .0001). The minimum threshold dose required to establish infection of the dam and fetus was at least 10 3 colony forming units, with consistent colonization of maternal and fetal tissues achieved only with 10 7 colony forming units. In some instances, rat fetal tissues could be colonized in the absence of concomitant amniotic fluid colonization. Interestingly, there appeared to be a predilection for colonization of the reproductive tissues.\r\n In the Sprague-Dawley rat, the infection rate of both the dam and fetus can be controlled by the inoculum dose. Our data support the concept that hematogenous spread of M pulmonis to the rat fetus can occur without amniotic fluid infection and suggest that the fetus itself can potentially seed the amniotic fluid with microorganisms. Importantly, manipulation of both the route of infection as well as infection dose provide a reproducible way to study both maternal and fetal immune response to infection during pregnancy.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] For the most part, intrauterine infections are clinically si-lent and are difficult to study, except with retrospective analysis. Therefore, development and characterization of appropriate animal models are critical to understand the causal relationship between infection and adverse outcomes. To elucidate the mechanisms and sequence of events by which bacterial pathogens cause adverse effects, a good animal model should use a natural disease that occurs in the model species, the infection should be easy to establish, the natural course of the disease should be similar to that in humans, and there should be a solid database of normal physiology.\r\n Mycoplasmas are among the most common isolates from the amniotic cavity of women with preterm labor and intact membranes. Isolation of Ureaplasma parvum\/urealyticum from the placenta is consistently correlated with disease when histologic evidence of chorioamnionitis is used as the criterion, 1, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO), including fetal infection have been correlated with the numbers of U urealyticum isolated from reproductive sites during pregnancy. 17 Importantly, antenatal intrauterine infection with ureaplasmas also has been linked to severe pulmonary and neurologic disorders in neonates. 2, 7, 9, 18, 19 Mycoplasma pulmonis genital disease is the only naturally occurring reproductive disease in laboratory animals that is caused by a member of the class Mollicutes, and infection of the uterus can be accomplished by both intravaginal and intravenous (IV) routes. 20-23 Once infected, dams that have varying complications develop similar to ureaplasmal-associated reproductive disease of humans, including chorioamnionitis, fetal infection of the lung and central nervous system, low birthweight, and fetal and neonatal death. 20 The contribution of the fetal immune response to infection is now recognized as a key determinant of APO. 5, 6 The specific objective of this study was to develop a reproducible animal model of fetal infection by manipulation of the infectious dose that would provide a versatile mechanism to address the innate fetal immune response without the confoundment of the adaptive maternal response, to correlate infection status among different maternal and fetal tissues, and to evaluate the placental pathology associated with the various infective doses.\r\n To ensure identical inocula for all experiments, a large-volume culture of M pulmonis strain X-1048 was grown to late logarithmic phase in Frey's medium, aliquoted, and frozen at \u03ea80\u00b0C. Immediately before infection, aliquots were thawed and diluted in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to obtain a concentration of 10 7 colony forming units (CFUs)\/100 L of medium. Ten-fold serial dilutions were made to obtain the additional infection doses. For each experiment, the number of CFUs in each inoculum was verified by culture. Unless otherwise noted, all cultures taken from animals at time of necropsy were serially diluted 10-fold in Frey's broth to 10 \u03ea5 and processed as described previously [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] \r\n Pregnant rats were shipped to arrive on gestational day (GD) 11 and housed in Microisolator (Lab Products, Inc, Maywood, NJ) cages. To maintain barrier conditions, all animals were handled within a laminar airflow hood. All food, water, and caging were autoclaved before use. Control rats were always handled first and were housed separately from inoculated rats.\r\n Previous studies have demonstrated that IV inoculation at GD 14 is the most efficient time point for inducing fetal infection. 20 Before inoculation, rats were killed on GD 14 with an intraperitoneal dose of ketamine (25 mg; Ketaject, Phoenix Pharmaceutical Inc, St. Joseph, MO) mixed with xylazine (0.375 mg; Xylazine-20, The Butler Co, Columbus, OH) to produce 30 minutes of anesthesia. Rats were ear-notched for identification and intravenously inoculated via the subclavian vein with 0 (control), 10 1 , 10 3 , 10 5 , and10 7 CFU of M pulmonis in 0.1 mL of Frey's broth. To calculate the number of animals required to detect a true dose effect, a power analysis was performed and the desired significance level (\u2423) was set at .05, power was set at 0.8, and the difference to detect between groups was set at 80%. By using a power chart for a variance of 1, a sample size of 6 falls between a power value of 0.8 to 0.92. By using these parameters, 5-6 animals per group would be the maximum required. A minimum of 5 animals was included in each treatment group, except the low-and high-dose groups. In accordance with the mandate of the Animal Welfare Act, we reduced the number of animals used at the highest and lowest infection dose. Because the results showed no colonization at the low dose (n \u03ed 4) and maximum colonization at the high dose (n \u03ed 5), no additional rats were infected at those doses.\r\n Necropsy procedures were performed as previously described. 22, 25, 26 Rats were killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (180 mg; Veterinary Laboratories Inc, Lenexa, TX) injected intraperitoneally. The spleen, liver, trachea, lung, vagina, and uterus were aseptically removed from each dam and cultured for M pulmonis. Endometrial cultures were performed by aseptically opening the uterine cavity and swabbing the endometrium.\r\n The opened uterus was examined for evidence of fetal resorption, maceration, or obvious fetal abnormalities. Resorbed fetuses were those that had obviously implanted in the uterine wall but had no remaining recognizable fetal structure compared with other fetal units at the same stage of gestation. In early resorptions, some evidence of an amniotic sac remained. Six fetal units were chosen at random for culture, and the remaining fetal units were placed in buffered formalin (1:10; Biochemical Sciences, Inc, Swedesboro, NJ) for histopathologic evaluation. The intact fetal unit (placenta, chorionic and amniotic membranes, amniotic fluid [AF], and fetus) with uterine tissues attached on either side of the placenta was removed. Each fetal unit and its corresponding tissues were labeled such that the fetal unit of origin could be identified. The placenta was separated from the endometrium and fetal membranes before culture. AF from each fetal unit was obtained by puncturing the chorioallantoic membrane with a sterile needle. 22,25,26 The fetus was disinfected with 70% ethanol before aseptic dissection and the fetal brain, lung, and spleen\/liver was removed and minced separately for culture.\r\n At least 3 placentas per dam per treatment group were randomly selected for histopathologic evaluation. After fixation in buffered formalin, the amniotic sac was punctured and the fetus removed. The endometrium with attached placenta and amniotic membranes was www.AJOG.org Basic Science: Obstetrics Research transected so that a cross-sectional view of endometrium, decidua\/labyrinth, and chorioamnion would be present on each section. Tissues were processed routinely, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E). Each placental section was randomly assigned a number to 4 observers blinded to the treatment of each tissue. The lesion scoring system was based on the degree of polymorphonu-clear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration, presence of mononuclear cells, and cellular degradation in order to measure the degree of deciduitis. 23 Numerical scores for grading the severity of deciduitis were as follows: 1 for absence of deciduitis, 2 for moderate deciduitis, and 3 for severe deciduitis.\r\n Data were examined for potential differences in litter size, number of resorptions, and log CFU\/mL by least-squares analysis of variance (ANOVA). When significant dose effects (P \u03fd .05) were detected, individual means were separated by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. Linear regression analysis was also performed on CFU data from cultured dam and fetal tissues. Categorical responses for culture status were compared by the 2 test. Kruskal-Wallis 1-way nonparametric ANOVA was used to compare factor levels for ordinal response variables of histology slide scores (Statistix Analytical Software, Tallahassee, FL). Differences were considered significant at P \u03fd .05.\r\n Not surprisingly, the numbers of M pulmonis recovered from the tissues were dependent on the initial inoculation dose ( Figure 1 ). Consistent colonization of the dam tissues occurred only in the high-dose (10 7 ) group (P \u03fd .001). Dams inoculated with 10 7 CFU inoculation had significantly higher numbers of M pulmonis colonies isolated from the vagina (P \u03ed .0001), uterus (P \u03ed .0001), and spleen (P \u03ed .0005) than any of the other inoculation groups ( Figure 1A ). However, no significant differences were detected in the number of M pulmonis isolated from blood (P \u03ed .62), lung (P \u03ed .60), and liver (P \u03ed .27) ( Figure 1B) . Interestingly, there appeared to be a predilection for colonization of the reproductive tissues rather than respiratory sites in the pregnant rat. At the lower infection doses, isolation of M pulmonis was variable. No dams were culture positive for M pulmonis in the trachea at any dose.\r\n There was no significant effect of M pulmonis infection (data not shown) on either litter size (P \u03ed .4739) or the number of resorptions (P \u03ed .2029). The fetal tissues were colonized by M pulmonis in a similar way as the maternal tissues. A significant difference among dose groups (P \u03fd .0001) was observed in log CFU of M pulmonis isolated from fetal tissues, and the numbers of M pulmonis recovered from fetal tissues were directly correlated with the dose group (Figure 2) . At the highest dose (10 7 ), M pulmonis was There was an increase in number of CFU isolated from AF (P \u03ed .0001), and placenta (P \u03ed .0001), at 10 7 compared to all other doses. B, Brain, lung, and spleen\/liver. Similar results were found for brain (P \u03ed .0001), lung (P \u03ed .0001), and spleen\/liver (P \u03ed .0001).\r\n recovered from brain (28\/30) and all other fetal tissues (30\/30). Perhaps the most informative data were obtained from the 10 5 inoculation dose group. M pulmonis was recovered from placenta (16\/36), AF (8\/36), spleen\/liver (15\/36), lung (15\/36), and brain (10\/36). At 10 5 inoculation dose group, both negative and positive fetal units could be identified within a litter. M pulmonis was not recovered from either control or the lowdose (10 1 ) group.\r\n The generally accepted mechanism of spread of infectious agents is that placental colonization precedes infection of AF. Fetal tissues are then infected via the AF. Because matched samples were available, the numbers of M pulmonis isolated from 126 fetal units were compared by regression analysis (Figures 3 and 4) . Not unexpectedly, a high correlation was found for all tissues (P \u03fd .0001), with the greatest correlation found between the placenta and the fetal spleen\/liver (correlation 0.95). There were a number of \r\n AFs that were culture negative, even when the corresponding placentas had mycoplasmas isolated at log CFU greater than 5 ( Figure 3) . Conversely, there were isolated cases in which the AF was infected without placental infection. The discrepancies between AF colonization and colonization levels in fetal lung and brain, in which mycoplasmal log CFU greater than 2 could be obtained in the absence of infected AF (Figure 4 ) are also intriguing. Colonization of the fetal spleen\/liver also occurred in the absence of AF infection, and in some instances the number of mycoplasmas recovered from spleen\/liver were several logs higher than the corresponding isolations from AF. Taken together, these data suggest that in at least some cases, fetal colonization preceded AF colonization.\r\n Differences in mean ranks for deciduitis (Table) were significantly different in some treatment groups (P \u03ed .0001); dams that received 10 7 CFU had the highest deciduitis rank. As would be expected, 62% of control tissues showed normal placental degeneration (Table 1, Figure 5, C) . At GD 18, this normal degradation is identified by only small, scattered necrotic cells and occasional PMN 27 and received a lesion score of 1. Moderate inflammation (lesion score of 2) was seen in placentas from the 10 1 , 10 3 , and 10 5 dose groups ( Figure 5, B) . Severe inflammatory infiltrate of PMN, mononuclear cells, and cellular degrada-tion (lesion score of 3) was found in 84% of placentas at the 10 7 dose (Figure 5, B) .\r\n We have characterized a rat model of maternal and fetal infection that can be manipulated by alteration of infectious dose (ID). Colonization of SD rat dam and fetal tissues by M pulmonis occurred in a dose-dependent manner after IV inoculation, similar to colonization results seen previously in vaginally and IV-infected rats. 20, 22, 25, 26 The minimum threshold dose required to establish infection of the dam and fetus is at least 10 3 CFU, with consistent colonization of all tissues achieved only with 10 7 CFU. For rat fetal units, the 10 5 dose may be too low to achieve ID 50 , but this dose would allow comparisons to be made between infected and uninfected fetal tissues within the same dam. The 10 5 dose may be a valuable tool to determine whether the maternal response to infection, without the confounding presence of infection in the fetus, influences fetal growth and development. At the 10 7 dose, consistent infection of fetal and placental tissues can be achieved for use in collecting infection data from an entire litter.\r\n Interestingly, in the SD rat model, the respiratory sites were colonized infrequently during pregnancy. Conversely, the uterus and vagina were colonized by M pulmonis in all dams at the 10 7 dose. This strongly suggests that there is an affinity for infection of the reproductive tract vs the respiratory tract after IV inoculation of pregnant rats. One explanation for this result may be the increased vascularization of the reproductive tract during gestation. Increased vascularization may more easily allow the microorganism to access and adhere in these regions. These tissues also may be enriched for nutrients that would favor the growth of M pulmonis. The tropism of M pulmonis for the reproductive tissues appears to be pregnancy-specific; in a previous study M pulmonis was recovered from the trachea in 35 of 36 naturally infected nonpregnant rats but was isolated from the uterus of only 17 of these same rats. 21 Further, in rats experimentally infected in the vagina before breeding, the reproductive tissues were more commonly colonized than the trachea once pregnancy was established. 22, 25, 26 The current paradigm is that infectious agents colonize the placenta, breach the placental barrier, and infect the AF, thereby gaining access to the fetus directly or via hematogenous spread from the placenta. 28, 30 Our results strongly support the concept that the SD rat fetuses may have been directly infected via the labyrinthian circulation. We observed that hematogenous spread of M pulmonis from the infected placenta to the fetus can occur without AF infection, and that, in some cases, the fetus itself could potentially seed the AF with microorganisms. This is consistent with some models proposed for human fetal infections that suggest the most severe consequences of intrauterine infection occur when the infectious agent colonizes the placenta and then is transported to the AF and fetus via hematogenous spread from the placenta. 1, [29] [30] [31] One drawback of the IV model is that establishment of infection is not the same as in naturally occurring disease. Although the vaginal model of infection is a more natural method of causing intrauterine infection, it also has limitations such as increased time to establish infection and uncertainty of level of infection. In addition, significant intrauterine infection is seen only in animals infected before breeding rather than at time points throughout gestation. [20] [21] [22] The IV model is more useful for studying acute, temporal effects of infection, whereas the vaginal infection model is better suited for chronic situations. Studies focused on mechanisms of low birthweight would be more appropriate for the vaginal model 20 as acute infection established in IV-infected rats did not result in low birthweight. An additional limitation of the model is that the use of M pulmonis rather than U parvum\/urealyticum precludes addressing microbespecific factors that may be involved in pathogenesis. This is somewhat analogous to other models, for example, that use purified LPS rather than live Gramnegative microbes for infection studies or that use of in vitro cell lines rather than whole animal studies; these models still provide critical insights into pathogenesis. The IV rodent model described here has provided important insights into lesion formation, mechanisms of fetal colonization, and fetal and maternal immune response. Although no animal model can be directly applicable to human disease, the similarities between human and rodent mycoplasmal genital infection (inflammatory cytokines present in AF, placental lesions, and the clinical presentation of poor pregnancy outcome) argue that the rodent model is appropriate. Further, manipulation of both the route of infection as well as infection dose provide a reproducible way to study both maternal and fetal immune response to infection during pregnancy.

The viruses have crown-like spikes on their surfaces and hence the name coronavirus. Human coronaviruses, enveloped RNA viruses, are not new and were first identified in the mid-1960s. There are four virus clusters within the Coronavirinae subfamily. These are alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, and gammacoronavirus. The fourth cluster is a provisionally assigned new group called delta coronaviruses. All known human coronaviruses belong to the genera Alphacoronavirus (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and Betacoronavirus (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and SARSCoV). 3 MERS-CoV, formerly HCoV-EMC, is the first human coronavirus in lineage C of the Betacoronavirus genus. 3 \r\n Between April 2012 and February 7, 2014 there were 182 documented cases of MERS-CoV infection worldwide. 5a The majority of these occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia where 148 cases were reported. MERS-CoV appears to have a predilection for individuals with underlying medical comorbidities. 1,4,6\u00c08\r\n The main modes of transmission are contact transmission, droplet transmission, and person-to-person transmission as supported by epidemiologic and phylogenetic analyses. 4 Currently, the MERS-CoV seems to have three epidemiological patterns of the disease. There are sporadic cases occurring in the communities of different Middle East countries, mainly the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan. The second pattern is nosocomial transmission within healthcare facilities to healthcare workers and other patients. 4 Intrafamilial transmission of MERS-CoV was also described. 1,4,7,9\u00c011\r\n The pathogenesis of the disease has been elucidated in recent studies. MERS-CoV has spike glycoprotein (S) that targets the cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). 12, 13 This viral spike has a putative receptorbinding domain (RBD). 13 MERS-CoV RBD has a core and a receptor-binding subdomain, which interacts with DPP4 \u03b2-propeller MERS-CoV RBD. 13 The MERS-CoV spike protein interacts with CD26 (also known as DPP4) and causes viral attachment to host cells and virus-cell fusion. 14 This is thought to be the first step in viral infection. The MERS-CoV infection results in profound apoptosis of infected respiratory cells within 24 hr. 15 \r\n MERS-CoV causes respiratory tract infection that ranges in severity from mild to fulminant respiratory infection. Mild respiratory illness was described in patients from Tunisia 16 and from the United Kingdom. 11 The clinical presentation of MERS-CoV is similar to SARS3. The initial phase is non-specific fever and mild, non-productive cough lasting several days, followed by progressive pneumonia. 4, 6 In MERS-CoV infections, most patients present with serious respiratory disease, resulting in a high mortality rate of 60%. 6 The mean age of affected patients was 56 years with a range of 14\u00c094 years. 6 A recent case of a 2-year-old patient was described. 17 The most common symptoms are fever (87%), cough (87%), and shortness of breath (48%). 4,6 About 35% of patients had accompanying gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea (22%) and vomiting (17%). Of the total cases, 50% had two medical co-morbidities, diabetes and chronic renal disease. 6 Important laboratory abnormalities in patients with MERS-CoV include: leucopenia (14%), lymphopenia (34%), thrombocytopenia 36%, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (49%), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (11%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (15%). 6 Chest radiographic abnormalities include: increased bronchovascular markings (17%), unilateral infiltrate (43%), bilateral infiltrates (22%), and diffuse reticulonodular pattern (4%). 4 \r\n Laboratory testing for MERS-CoV is a challenge. Currently, there are no validated serologic assays. The main testing method relies on identification of MERS-CoV using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from respiratory tract secretions. It is not clear at this point of time whether sputum or nasopharyngeal samples are superior to throat swabs. 4 \r\n To date, there are no specific laboratory abnormalities or clinical data that differentiate pneumonia due to MERS-CoV from pneumonia caused by other viruses or other bacterial pathogens. The primary diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection relies on the identification of the virus in respiratory secretions using real-time RT-PCR.\r\n The main therapeutic options for MERS-CoV infection are not known. There is no specific therapy for MERS-CoV infection. Recently, in vitro studies showed that MERS-CoV is 50\u00c0100 times more sensitive to alpha interferon (IFN-\u03b1) treatment than SARS-CoV. 18 In a recent decision support document, convalescent plasma was given an order of recommendation of 1, followed by interferon, protease inhibitors (order of recommendations of 2), and intravenous globulin (order of recommendations of 3). 19 Further randomized controlled trials of these agents are needed to establish the efficacy and side effects.\r\n The main infection control measures to prevent the transmission of MERS-CoV include contact isolation, standard precautions, droplet isolation, and airborne infection isolation precautions especially when healthcare workers perform aerosol generating procedures. 20 Droplet precautions include wearing a medical mask when in close contact (within 1 meter) and upon entering the room or cubicle of the patient. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends placing patients with suspected or confirmed MERS-CoV infection in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). 21 If an AIIR is not available, the patient should be transferred as soon as is feasible to a facility where an AIIR is available. Pending transfer, place a facemask on the patient and isolate him\/her in a single-patient room with the door closed. 21 Performing hand hygiene in accordance with the World Health Organization's (WHO) 5 moments of hand hygiene is of paramount importance and could not be stressed more. Additional measures include wearing a particulate respirator when performing aerosol-generating procedures in addition to other precautions. In a recent MERS-CoV outbreak in a healthcare setting, there was evidence of person-to-person transmission and the outbreak was aborted by the implementation of infection control measures. 4 ","sha":"ab6b98662d778b6aa71751d6a2e3b3c19282f72a","publish_time":"2014-12-31","authors":"Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Memish, Ziad A.","journal":"Emerging Infectious Diseases","doi":"10.1016\/b978-0-12-416975-3.00014-5","Title":"Emerging Infectious Diseases","H index":202.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"laboratory for Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) upE reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

The case fatality ratio (CFR) is a representative measurement of severity of a disease that directly captures virulence (ie, the conditional risk of death for patients with a disease or infection), whereas mortality (ie, the risk of death in a population) depends not only on the disease severity but also the risk of infection in a population. Because there have been several confl icting estimates of the CFR for pandemic H1N1, 1-6 I off er an interpretation of these reports and identify key areas that need to be clarifi ed.\r\n In the early stages of the 2009 infl uenza pandemic, two approaches were taken when calculating the CFR. One approach focused on estimation of CFR during the course of the pandemic. 1-3 During outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome from 2002 to 2003, use of a crude ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to the number of cases at a given point in time underestimated the CFR. 7 To avoid similar underestimations, accounting for the time delay from onset of disease to death, the confi rmed CFR of pandemic H1N1, which took confi rmed cases as the denominator, was estimated to be about 0\u00b75%. 1-3,6 However, because the estimate depends on the proportion of symptomatic patients who have confi rmatory diagnosis, it is not useful for prediction of the overall mortality. 6 In other words, the diffi culty in case ascertainment remains a limitation of confi rmed CFR. Motivated by this limitation, the second approach calculated the CFR by taking symptomatic cases as the denominator, although in this study the denominator was not clearly defi ned. 4 Despite several technical problems, this approach emphasised the importance of accounting for unconfi rmed cases to yield an appropriate order of the CFR estimate (fi gure 1). 4 Subsequent to these earlier eff orts, Presanis and colleagues 5 have off ered a way to predict the mortality in a population, by explicitly taking symptomatic cases as the denominator and thus calculating the symptomatic CFR. The symptomatic CFR among all medically attended cases was estimated to be 0\u00b7048%, one-tenth of the CFR estimate from confi rmed cases. In other words, only one of ten symptomatic cases seems to have been confi rmed. By use of self-reported infl uenza-like illness as the denominator, the estimate was even smaller. Presanis and colleagues 5 and a later study in the UK 8 have adeptly shown that 2009 pandemic H1N1 infl uenza can be subjectively perceived as mild.\r\n Caution is needed when interpreting age-specifi c estimates (fi gure 2). The confi rmed CFR in Mexico 9 and the USA 10 increases with age, most probably because underlying medical conditions that can increase the risk of infl uenza death are most common in elderly people. 10, 11 The similar age-specifi c pattern is also seen in symptomatic CFR. 8 The diff ering CFR estimates between age-groups hamper precise estimation for entire populations during the early stages of the pandemic. 12 Furthermore, although there might be two countries with very diff erent CFR estimates, comparisons will be futile unless the composition of the cases (ie, age-groups and risk-groups of fatal and non-fatal cases) is known. The best way to describe the severity of pandemic infl uenza to non-experts is to compare its virulence with that of other infl uenza epidemics. However, because diff erent methods have been used to predict the mortality impact associated with pandemic H1N1 and non-pandemic infl uenza, the strict comparison of virulence has been diffi cult. Estimations of mortality for non-pandemic infl uenza have been made mainly with Serfl ing cyclical regression, 13 which accounts for deaths that are both directly and indirectly associated with infl uenza. A recent study in the USA suggested that there were up to 44 100 excess deaths in May to December, 2009, 14 implying that the mortality eff ect of the infl uenza pandemic surpassed that of non-pandemic infl uenza seasons. However, because this estimate of excess mortality refl ects both transmission potential and virulence, a comparative assessment of virulence alone has yet to be established.\r\n In addition to the above-mentioned issues surrounding the estimation of CFR, pharmaceutical interventions such as antiretroviral treatment or immunisation programmes also bias the estimated risk of death. Thus, to provide an unbiased CFR for the 2009 infl uenza pandemic that can accurately represent the overall virulence and permit comparisons within and between populations, we are faced with a challenge to adjust for such potential treatment eff ects that may require substantial epidemiological and statistical eff orts.\r\n Japan Science and Technology Agency, Saitama, Japan; and Theoretical Epidemiology, University of Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands h.nishiura@uu.nl I declare that I have no confl icts of interest.

Depletion of these cells experimentally or by drugs or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in humans leads to the development of opportunistic infections as well as increased rates of bacteremia with certain bacterial pneumonias. Recently, it has been proposed that CD4 + T-cell subsets may also be excellent targets for mucosal vaccination to prevent pulmonary infections in susceptible hosts. Here we review recent findings that increase our understanding of T-cell subsets and their effector cytokines in the context of pulmonary infection.","text_body":"CD4 + T-helper (Th) cells are critical components of the adaptive immunity in the lung (Fig.  1 ). The development of these cells arises after priming with antigen presented by class II major histocompatibility complexes (termed signal 1). Further activation occurs after the engagement of costimulatory molecules and their receptors expressed on both antigenpresenting cells (APCs) and T cells (termed signal 2). This second signal is critical for both generating antigen-specific effector T cells as well as memory cells. Presentation of antigen in the absences of costimulation can result in T-cell anergy. Final effector function is due to cytokine\/growth factor-directed CD4 + T-cell differentiation (signal 3). This latter aspect of differentiation is driven by lineage-specific transcription factors as well as changes in chromatin remodeling. The critical role of CD4 + T cells in lung immunity and pulmonary host defenses was clearly demonstrated by the high incidence of pulmonary infections as a complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections\/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (1-3).\r\n Th2 CD4 + T-cells differentiate from naive precursors under the direction of the transcription factor GATA3 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) (4) . Effector cytokines produced by Th2 cells include interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13. GATA3 binds directly to the Il4 locus, and IL-4 and signaling via STAT6 is critical for further Th2 proliferation and lineage commitment (4) . Th2 effector cytokines mediate immunity against infections with helminths (Fig. 2) . Deletion of Gata3 in mice results is embryonic lethal but conditional deletion of Gata3 in T cells confirms the essential role of this transcription factor in Th2 differentiation and the expulsion of helminths from the gastrointestinal tract (5) . IL-5 is an essential growth factor for eosinophilopoiesis (6, 7) . Mice with homozygous deletion of Il5 have substantial reduction in both peripheral and bone marrow eosinophils (6, 7) . In contrast, overexpression of IL-5 protein results in substantial eosinophilia in blood and tissues (8) . IL-13 signals through a receptor complex of IL13RA1 and IL4R\u03b1 and activates STAT6 signaling. These receptors are expressed on airway epithelium as well as airway smooth muscle. In bronchial epithelium, IL-13 is a major factor in mucous production and goblet cell differentiation in the airway (9, 10) . Moreover, IL-13 signaling via STAT6 in airway smooth muscle and in airway epithelium leads to airways hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (9, 10) . These cells and effector cytokines have been implicated in diseases such as allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma (11) . Anti-IL-5 has been investigated in asthma and although initial studies did not show clear cut efficacy (12) , but subgroups of patients with high sputum eosinophilia respond to IL-5 blockade (12) . Similarly, initial studies with IL-13 blockade were also negative, but recently, studies suggest that by stratifying patients with IL-13 driven asthma (by assessing the serum level of periostin, an IL-13 regulated gene in lung epithelium) can identify subgroups who respond to anti-IL-13 (13) . In addition to asthma, IL-13 has been implicated in fibrotic processes in the lung in response to drugs such as bleomycin (14) (15) (16) .\r\n Th2 cells also facilitate B-cell differentiation and antibody responses to T-cell-dependent protein antigens (17) , including the development of an anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) response. It has been recently recognized that Th2 cell differentiation is not only regulated by IL-4 but also several cytokines produced by the lung epithelium including thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-25, and IL-33 (17) . It has been shown recently that polymorphism in both IL-33 and it receptors ST2 are associated with asthma, strongly implicating Th2 cells and specifically the IL-33 ST2 signaling pathway in this disease.\r\n Th1 cells, initially described by Mossman and Coffman (18) , were defined by their ability to express interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3). Differentiation of CD4 + Th1 cells is controlled by the transcription factors T-bet (19) and STAT4. Differentiation is controlled by IL-12p70, which is a heterodimer of IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 subunits (20) . However, both in vitro and in vivo Th1 differentiation can be independent of IL-12. One critical IL-12 independent pathway is through the induction of type I interferons that can facilitate Th1 differentiation in certain situations (21) . IFN-\u03b3 which signals via a receptor complex consisting of two IFN-\u03b3R1 and two IFN-\u03b3R2 chains can signal in a autocrine paracrine fashion to further amplify Th1 differentiation and lineage commitment. IFN-\u03b3 receptors are expressed on a wide variety of cells including myeloid cells including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) as well as structural cells in the lung such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts (22) . IFN-\u03b3R1 and IFN-\u03b3R2 activate Janus-associated kinases 1 and 2 (JAK1\/2), which phosphorylates STAT1. STAT1 undergoes homodimerization and translocation to the nucleus and binds to DNAencoded \u03b3-activated sequences (GAS) that ultimately control gene transcription (22) . IFN-\u03b3 is critical for mediating immunity and host resistance to many intracellular infections including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Listeria moncoytogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium. Patients with mutations IL-12p40, IFN-\u03b3, or receptors for IL-12 or IFN-\u03b3 have increased susceptibility to intracellular infections due to these organisms (23, 24) . Patients with IFN-\u03b3 receptor mutations can develop disseminated infection with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) that is resistant to antibiotics and IFN-\u03b3 therapy (23, 25) . Patients with IL-12p40 mutations can also develop BCG or S. typhimurium infection but theoretically can respond to IFN-\u03b3 (24) . Thus, there is strong evidence that this pathway is essential for human control of these intracellular pathogens.\r\n Th17 cells are recently described effector lineage of T-helper cells that produces IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-26 (the latter expressed in human cells). Th17 cells differentiate under control of the transcription factors retinoid orphan receptor-\u03b3 (ROR\u03b3), ROR-\u03b1, and STAT3 (26, 27) . It was initially believed that one of the critical instructional cytokines for Th17 differentiation was IL-23 (28) ; however, IL-23 receptors are not expressed on naive CD4 + T cells. Landmark studies published in 2005 showed that these cells develop independently of STAT4 or STAT6 as well as Tbet or GATA3 (29, 30) . These data implicated that Th17 cells were a distinct CD4 + T-cell lineage (29, 30) . Th17 differentiation can occur with stimulation with transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and IL-6 (31) (32) (33) . Moreover this cytokine\/growth factor combination induces the expression of IL-23R (31) (32) (33) . Signaling via IL-23 allows terminal differentiation and expansion of Th17 cells (34) . Another critical effector cytokine produced by Th17 cells is IL-22, which is controlled by IL-23 as well as the transcription factor the arylhydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) (35) . IL-21 (36, 37) can function in an autocrine manner to further expand Th17 differentiation ( Fig. 1 ). It has been recently been shown in vivo that TGF\u03b2 activation and thus differentiation of Th17 cells requires activation of latent TGF\u03b2 by \u03b1v inetgrins (38, 39) . This pathway is not required for IL-17 production by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (38, 39) .\r\n T-follicular helpher (Tfh) cells are a sub-group of CD4 + T cells that are located in the B-cell follicle region of secondary lymphoid tissues including lymph nodes and bronchial associated lymphoid tissues in the lung. These cells regulate T-cell-dependent B-cell activation through the expression of CD40L and IL-21 (40). These cells develop under the control of the transcription factor Bcl-6 (40) and are also regulated by inducible costimulatory (ICOS).\r\n Treg differentiation is controlled by the transcription factors Foxp3 and STAT5 (41). These cells are essential for mediating tolerance to inhaled antigen in the lung (41). Deletion of these cells or abrogating their effector molecules, which include IL-10 and TGF\u03b2, prevent airways sensitization to allergen as well as allergic inflammation (41). These cells can suppress the effector activity of many T-helper subsets and can be thymically derived (natural Tregs) or induced in the periphery (iTregs). An exhaustive review of these cells is beyond the scope of this chapter, but the reader is referred to excellent thorough reviews (41, 42) of these cells if they seek a more in depth description of these cells.\r\n Other cells in the lung exist that produce many of the same effector cytokines as Th1, Th2, or Th17 cells including innate lymphoid cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are resident in mucosal sites including the lung and can produce IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-17, and IL-22 (43). These cells are a major source of early IL-17 after pulmonary infection, and IL-17 production by these cells is regulated by IL-23 and IL-1\u03b2 (44-48). \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell production of IL-10 has been shown to play a key counter-inflammatory role in some pulmonary infections such as Pneumocystis infection (49). NK cells can also produce IL-4, IFN\u03b3, and IL-17 (50) in the lung in response to infection, allergen, or ozone. One population that has been extensively studied is a population that expresses an invariant T-cell receptor (iNKT cells) that recognizes a galactolipid Sphingomonas, \u03b1-galactosylceramide (51, 52). These cells are elevated in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid of patients with asthma (53, 54). NKT cells produce IFN\u03b3 in response to S. pneumoniae pulmonary infection (55) and IL-17 in response to E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (50). These cells also produce IL-17, and this response is critical for airways hyperresponsiveness to ozone (56). NK cells can develop under the control of IL-15 and express antiviral molecules such as IFN-\u03b3 as well as cytotoxic molecules (57).\r\n Innate lymphoid cells are also important sources of effector cytokines in the lung. These cells are defined by the lack of lineage markers and T-cell receptors, but they require IL-7 signaling for their development. Thus, these cells are present in recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1) or RAG2 \u2212\/\u2212 mice but are lacking in RAG2, common \u03b3 chain (\u03b3c) double deleted mice (58, 59). Retinoid orphan receptor \u03b3t (ROR\u03b3t)-expressing cells are critical for the formation of secondary lymphoid tissues (via regulation of lymphotoxin expression) and play critical roles in mucosal immunology in the gastrointestinal tract through the production of IL-17 and IL-22 (60). Type 2 ILCs produce IL-5 and IL-13 and participate in the clearance of helminths from the gastrointestinal tract (61) . These cells appear to be regulated by IL-25 (IL-17E) as well as IL-33, a member of the IL-1 family. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a population of ILCs produce IL-13 in response to IL-33 induced by viral infection, and these cells mediate in part viral induced exacerbation of allergic disease in the lung (62) . These cells can also be activated by protease allergens to drive eosinphilic airways inflammation as well as airways hyperresponsiveness (58) under control of IL-33 and TSLP. Thus, these cells recapitulate many aspects of CD4 + T-cell immunity in that there are subsets that express similar effector molecules, yet these cells are activated early and their activation is independent of TCR stimulation.\r\n Both IL-4 and IL-13 activates STAT6 signaling in a variety of lung cells including alveolar macrophages, fibroblasts, airway smooth muscle, and airway epithelium. In macrophages, activation of STAT6 leads to what is termed 'alternative macrophage activation' which is characterized by the expression of arginase 1, YM1, YM2, and the macrophage mannose receptor (63) . It has been shown that IL-4 treatment of macrophages can reduce their phagocytic ability but IL-4 stimulation of macrophages can augment the clearance of apoptotic neutrophils (63) . Alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) play regulatory roles in helminth infection and can reduce immunopathology (63) . It has also been shown that AAMs have augmented dectin-1 expression as well as the macrophage mannose receptor. Given that both of these receptors are critical in recognizing the fungal carbohydrates \u03b21,3 glucan and mannan respectively, AAMs may have greater fungicidal activity. Induction of AAMs may also be exploited by pathogens to allow their survival. For example, Francisella tularensis, a virulent pathogen in the lung, can prolong its intracellular survival via induction of AAMs (64) .\r\n As mentioned earlier, IL-13 induction of STAT6 signaling induces several mucin genes in airway epithelium including Muc5ac and Muc5b as well as inducing goblet cell hyperplasia (65) . These signaling effects are critical for host defenses against helminths such as Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (66) . During viral infection, airways mucins can prevent viral spread; however, in infants this can also contribute to airway obstruction. The role of IL-13 in viral infection is complex, and IL-13 is not necessarily beneficial to the host. For example, IL-13 has recently been shown to increase the susceptibility of epithelial cells to infection with rhinovirus (67).\r\n There are several mechanisms by which IFN-\u03b3 controls lung immunity to intracellular pathogens. IFN-\u03b3 can prime macrophages to enhance their intracellular microbiocidal activity (68) in a process termed classical activation of macrophages (69) . IFN-\u03b3 priming augments Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling (70) . IFN-\u03b3 also increases microbiocidal activity via the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase, which regulates the production of reactive nitrogen intermediates (71, 72) . IFN-\u03b3 can also increase the production of reactive oxygen species. These activities may explain the therapeutic benefit of IFN-\u03b3 in patients with chronic granulomatous disease due to mutations in NADPH oxidase (73) (74) (75) .\r\n IFN-\u03b3 signaling also upregulates class II major histocompatibility complex molecules and costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86, which can augment antigen presentation to naive T cells. IFN-\u03b3's first observed activity was its ability to suppress viral replication in many target cells including macrophages, fibroblasts, and lung epithelial cells (76) . This occurs in part though the induction of many anti-viral genes such as MxA (77) . However, other respiratory viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus are controlled by IFN\u03b3 through mechanisms that are independent of MxA (78).\r\n several chemokine ligands for CXCR3 including CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. CXCR3 is expressed on Th1 cells, and thus, the induction of these chemokines by IFN-\u03b3 may be a critical mechanism to increase the recruitment of Th1 cells. Moreover these chemokines are critical for granuloma formation, which is essential for control of many intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis (79, 80) . Systemic and aerosolized IFN-\u03b3 has been investigated for the potential adjunctive treatment of tuberculosis. A recent meta-analysis showed that IFN-\u03b3 was well tolerated and associated with higher sputum sterilization rates (81); however, definitive randomized control trials are lacking to make firm conclusions on the efficacy of this cytokine.\r\n IL-17 can signal in human bronchial epithelium (HBE) to induced chemokine ligands for CXCR2 such as CXCL8, CXCL1, and the granulopoietic growth factor G-CSF (82, 83) . Like other cell systems, HBE responses to IL-17 or IL-17F are augmented by TNF-\u03b1 (82, 84) . HBE cells express IL-17RA, IL-17RC, as well as IL-22R and IL-10R2, the receptors for IL-22 (82, 83) (Fig. 3) . Since IL-17A and IL-17F can be co-expressed in the same cell, it has been reported that these two IL-17 family members can form three cytokines including IL-17A homodimers, IL-17A\/F heterodimers, which have intermediate activity compared to IL-17A homodimers, and IL-17F homodimers, which have the least potent activity (85). One mechanism by which IL-17 increases the production of chemokines is through increasing mRNA stability of this transcript (86, 87) resulting in augmented protein production. A similar mechanism has also been reported for IL-17-mediated increases in G-CSF production (88) .\r\n IL-17RA is ubiquitously expressed on many cells including myeloid cells; however, these cells express very little IL-17RC. Thus, IL-17A and IL-17F have limited activity on myeloid cells. It has been reported that IL-17 can enhance IL-12p70 in alveolar macrophages (89) as well CCL2, CCL3, GM-CSF, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-9 in CD4 + T cells (90) . Th17 cells express IL-17RA and IL-17RE, which form a receptor complex for IL-17C (91) (92) (93) . IL-17C can increase the production of IL-17 by these cells (91) (92) (93) . IL-17C can be expressed in lung epithelium (unpublished observations) and thus can serve as a feed forward mechanism by which the epithelium could influence interstitial T-cell responses. In addition to regulating neutrophil recruitment in the lung (94) , IL-17 augments apical bicarbonate transport in HBE cells (95) . Carbonate anion regulates the activity of \u03b2 defensins (96) , and this may be an important mechanism of IL-17's net antimicrobial effect in the lung mucosa.\r\n IL-17RA is required for host resistance to the extracelluar pathogens K. pneumoniae (94) and in this model IL-17RA regulates the local production of CXCR2 ligands as well granulopoiesis trough the regulation of G-CSF. IL-17RA is dispensable for the control of intracellular pathogen M. tuberculosis (83) but is required for the control of the intracellular pathogen Franciscella tularensis (89) . In this latter model, IL-17 regulates IL-12p70 production by macrophages, which subsequently generates the Th1 CD4 + T-cell response ultimately controls the pathogen (89). (83) and also augments repair to puncture injury in confluent HBE cells (97) (Fig. 3) . IL-17 and IL-22 stimulation of HBE and mouse tracheal epithelial cells induces several anti-microbial genes in lung epithelium including lipocalin 2 (83) and regenerating islet-derived protein 3-\u03b3 (98) . Neutralization of IL-22 during experimental K. pneumoniae lung infection results in rapid bacteremia, which substantially increases mortality in this model. IL-22 is regulated by IL-23 and recombinant IL-22 can rescue IL-23-deficient mice (83) . A complication pneumonia is acute lung injury which can be exacerbated by mechanical ventilation also called ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI). In a model of VILI, recombinant IL-22 has also been shown to decrease lung leak and improve lung fluid dynamics (99) . These data support a potential therapeutic role of IL-22 in diseases such as severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.\r\n In primary infection, early sources of IL-17 and IL-22 can be from innate lymphoid cells (100), NK or NKT cells (100, 101) , or \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (44, 102, 103 ). However CD4 + Th17 cells can be elicited in the lung by vaccination. Vaccine-induced Th17 responses have been shown to be play protective roles in a diverse set of organisms including both intracellular and extracellular bacteria as well as fungi. For example, Th17 cells induced by vaccination with the antigen from M. tuberculosis ESAT-6 induce a population of Th17 cells that augment the local production of ligands for CXCR3 in the lung and result in substantial enhanced recruitment of protective Th1 cells (104) . Fungal specific Th17 cells have also been shown to be critical for vaccine-induced protection against Coccidioides posadasii, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Blastomyces dermatitidis infection (105) . In this setting, the protection against fungal challenge was dependent on IL-17 regulation of neutrophil recruitment.\r\n Vaccination of with whole cell polysaccharides of S. pneumoniae has been shown to induce IL-17 in the lung, and this IL-17 response has been shown to mediate serotype-independent immunity (106) . Chen et al. (48) have also shown that Th17 cells elicited by K. pneumoniae vaccination recognize conserved outer membrane proteins in the cell wall of the bacteria and these antigens could also provide serotype-independent immunity. Th17 cells conferred heterologous protection against multiple serotypes of the organism (48). Thus in two models of important human extracelluar pathogens, Th17 cells are capable of mediating serotype independent immunity which may advance vaccine approaches against these pathogens. It still remains to be defined which specific aspects of Th17 function that are required for protection. There needs to be better understanding of factors important in generating mucosal Th17 cells in the lung such as adjuvants, factor regulating proliferation, homing and survival. More research is needed to also define the contributions of IL-22, IL-17F, and IL-17A\/F heterodimers.\r\n CD4 + T cells play critical roles in lung immunity, and these cells are impacted by many drugs as well as by HIV infection. CD4 + T cells are critical targets to achieve therapeutic vaccines against both bacterial and fungal pathogens. Future work will be required to understand the induction and survival of these cells in the lung and how they can be manipulated therapeutically. \r\n Antigen is presented by dendritic cells (DCs) by class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to naive CD4 + Th0 cells. Full T-cell activation requires a second signal consisting of the upregulation and expression of costimulatory molecules such as inducible costimulatory ligand (ICOSL), CD28, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4). T-cell differentiation is instructed by cytokine\/growth factor signals. Tbet can be activated by STAT1 as well as bind to the IFN\u03b3 locus followed by induction of IL-12\u03b2R2. IL-12 activates STAT4, which can further drive Th1 development. IFN\u03b3 can act in an autocrine manner to further augment Th1 differentiation. IL-4 induces Gata3, which further induces IL-4 and supports the differentiation of Th2 cells. Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 as their effector cytokines. TGF\u03b2 and IL-6 can induce ROR\u03b3t expression as well as activation of STAT3. This leads to induction of the IL-23 receptor, rendering these cells responsive to IL-23, which is required for terminal differentiation of Th17 cells. Th17 cells produce the cytokines IL-17\/IL-17F, IL-22, IL-21. IL-21 can act in an autocrine fashion to further the differentiation of the Th17 lineage.\r\n Allergen parasites or helminthic infection can induce TSLP and IL-25 in the lung epithelium. These cytokines can drive early IL-4 production leading to the differentiation of Th2 cells. IL-4 and IL-13 can drive the induction of IgE as well as stimulate epithelial cells to increase mucous production. IL-5 is a critical regulator of eosinophilopoiesis. Binding of IgE to FcR\u03b5 on mast cells leads to their degranulation and release of chymases, tryptases, and histamines.\r\n Many infections, including those caused by fungi and bacteria, can activate dendritic cells and macrophages to produce IL-6, IL-23, and IL-1\u03b2. IL-23 and IL-1\u03b2 can drive IL-17 production by both innate lymphoid cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells. Differentiation of Th17 cells requires TGF\u03b2, and a critical mechanism of activation of TGF\u03b2 in the lung is through the activation of this growth factor by \u03b1v inetgrins. IL-17 and IL-22 can signal to the epithelium to augment G-CSF as well as ligands for CXCR2 that mediate the recruitment of neutrophils. These two cytokines also induce the expression of antimicrobial proteins such as lipcolain-2 and \u03b2-defensins. IL-22 can also augment epithelial repair. After vaccination, Th17 cells through the production of IL-17 can also induce ligands for CXCR3 that increase the recruitment of IFN\u03b3-producing Th1 cells, which can also help control intracellular pathogen growth.","sha":"d72c90ddfa72ba7123cf8596c8828eea2db5ab3b","publish_time":"2013-02-13","authors":"Kolls, Jay K.","journal":"Immunological Reviews","doi":"10.1111\/imr.12030","Title":"Immunological Reviews","H index":197.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"CD4 + T-helper (Th) cells are critical components of the adaptive immunity in the lung (Fig. Further activation occurs after the engagement of costimulatory molecules and their receptors expressed on both antigenpresenting cells (APCs) and T cells (termed signal 2).

IFN-\u03b3 is critical for mediating immunity and host resistance to many intracellular infections including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Listeria moncoytogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium. Patients with mutations IL-12p40, IFN-\u03b3, or receptors for IL-12 or IFN-\u03b3 have increased susceptibility to intracellular infections due to these organisms (23, 24) . Moreover this cytokine\/growth factor combination induces the expression of IL-23R (31) (32) (33) . Deletion of these cells or abrogating their effector molecules, which include IL-10 and TGF\u03b2, prevent airways sensitization to allergen as well as allergic inflammation (41). An exhaustive review of these cells is beyond the scope of this chapter, but the reader is referred to excellent thorough reviews (41, 42) of these cells if they seek a more in depth description of these cells. NKT cells produce IFN\u03b3 in response to S. pneumoniae pulmonary infection (55) and IL-17 in response to E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (50). Innate lymphoid cells are also important sources of effector cytokines in the lung. Retinoid orphan receptor \u03b3t (ROR\u03b3t)-expressing cells are critical for the formation of secondary lymphoid tissues (via regulation of lymphotoxin expression) and play critical roles in mucosal immunology in the gastrointestinal tract through the production of IL-17 and IL-22 (60). Alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) play regulatory roles in helminth infection and can reduce immunopathology (63) . Given that both of these receptors are critical in recognizing the fungal carbohydrates \u03b21,3 glucan and mannan respectively, AAMs may have greater fungicidal activity. Induction of AAMs may also be exploited by pathogens to allow their survival. During viral infection, airways mucins can prevent viral spread; however, in infants this can also contribute to airway obstruction. For example, IL-13 has recently been shown to increase the susceptibility of epithelial cells to infection with rhinovirus (67). There are several mechanisms by which IFN-\u03b3 controls lung immunity to intracellular pathogens. IFN-\u03b3 can also increase the production of reactive oxygen species. This occurs in part though the induction of many anti-viral genes such as MxA (77) . However, other respiratory viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus are controlled by IFN\u03b3 through mechanisms that are independent of MxA (78). several chemokine ligands for CXCR3 including CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Systemic and aerosolized IFN-\u03b3 has been investigated for the potential adjunctive treatment of tuberculosis. IL-17RA is ubiquitously expressed on many cells including myeloid cells; however, these cells express very little IL-17RC. It has been reported that IL-17 can enhance IL-12p70 in alveolar macrophages (89) as well CCL2, CCL3, GM-CSF, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-9 in CD4 + T cells (90) . IL-17C can be expressed in lung epithelium (unpublished observations) and thus can serve as a feed forward mechanism by which the epithelium could influence interstitial T-cell responses. IL-17RA is required for host resistance to the extracelluar pathogens K. pneumoniae (94) and in this model IL-17RA regulates the local production of CXCR2 ligands as well granulopoiesis trough the regulation of G-CSF. It still remains to be defined which specific aspects of Th17 function that are required for protection. There needs to be better understanding of factors important in generating mucosal Th17 cells in the lung such as adjuvants, factor regulating proliferation, homing and survival. CD4 + T cells play critical roles in lung immunity, and these cells are impacted by many drugs as well as by HIV infection. Antigen is presented by dendritic cells (DCs) by class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to naive CD4 + Th0 cells. TGF\u03b2 and IL-6 can induce ROR\u03b3t expression as well as activation of STAT3. Th17 cells produce the cytokines IL-17\/IL-17F, IL-22, IL-21. IL-21 can act in an autocrine fashion to further the differentiation of the Th17 lineage. IL-4 and IL-13 can drive the induction of IgE as well as stimulate epithelial cells to increase mucous production. IL-22 can also augment epithelial repair. After vaccination, Th17 cells through the production of IL-17 can also induce ligands for CXCR3 that increase the recruitment of IFN\u03b3-producing Th1 cells, which can also help control intracellular pathogen growth."},{"Unnamed: 0":62,"Unnamed: 0.1":62,"doc_id":"94323cdd487b47759e3efc58ac779bf02d5cb184","title":"CxCL10\/CxCR3-mediated Responses Promote Immunity to Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection by Augmenting Dendritic Cell and CD8 + T Cell Efficacy","abstract":"The induction of inflammatory cytokines during respiratory viral infections contributes to both disease pathogenesis and resolution. The present studies investigated the role of the chemokine CxCL10 and its specific receptor, CxCR3, in the host response to pulmonary respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Antibody-mediated neutralization of CxCL10 resulted in a significant increase in disease pathogenesis, including airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), mucus gene expression, and impaired viral clearance. When the pulmonary cytokine levels were examined, only type I IFN and IL-12p70 were significantly reduced. These latter observations were reflected in reduced dendritic cell (DC) numbers and DC maturation in the lungs of RSV-infected mice treated with anti-CxCL10. Neutralization of the only known receptor for CxCL10, CxCR3, resulted in similar increases in pathogenic responses. When bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) were incubated with CxCL10 and RSV, an upregulation of type I IFN was observed. In addition, T lymphocytes were also examined and a significant decrease in the number of RSV M2 peptidespecific CD8 + T cells was identified. These findings highlight a previously unappreciated role for the CXCL10:CXCR3 signaling axis in RSV-infected animals by recruiting virus-specific T cells into the lung and promoting viral clearance.","text_body":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects nearly all infants by age 2 and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis in children worldwide [1] . It is estimated by the CDC that up to 125,000 pediatric hospitalizations in the United States each year are due to RSV, at an annual cost of over $300,000,000 [2] . Despite the generation of RSV-specific adaptive immune responses, RSV does not confer protective immunity and recurrent infections throughout life are common [3, 4] . While RSV is especially detrimental in very young infants whose airways are small and easily occluded, RSV is also widely becoming recognized as an important pathogen in transplant recipients, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the elderly, as well as likely other patients with chronic lung disease, especially asthma. Recent data suggest that mortality for all ages combined have been approximately 30\/100,000 from 1990-2000, with an annual average of over 17,000 in the US [5, 6] . These numbers are likely grossly underestimated, as RSV infection has not been examined in adults in a consistent manner. Thus, RSV not only causes significant exacerbated lung disease in young and old, but also is associated with significant mortality. Although anti-RSV antibodies are available and appear to alleviate severe disease, they perform best when given prior to infection, and few other options exist for combating the RSV infections in susceptible patient populations [7] .\r\n Clinical studies have suggested that the severity of RSV-induced disease correlates with the influx of leukocytes, resulting in damage to the airways [3] . Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) have been shown to correlate directly to the intensity of the inflammatory response and are induced by viral infection. In particular, a number of studies have demonstrated that CxCL8 (IL-8), CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), and CCL5 (RANTES) released during the RSV infection correlate to the most severe cases of RSV infection in infants [8] [9] [10] . More recently, chemokine production has been linked directly to recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed during the viral infection [11, 12] . In particular, the recognition of dsRNA by either TLR3 or RIG-I pathways induces the production of type I IFN and chemokines, especially CCL5 and CxCL10 [12] . Blockade of CCL5-mediated responses in animal models of RSV appears to attenuate disease pathogenesis by reducing airway hyperreactivity and mucus overproduction [13] . Little information exists on the potential role of CxCL10 and its receptor CxCR3 in the development of pathogenesis during RSV infection. The results from previous studies, together with the one presented here, indicate that while both CCL5 and CxCL10 are expressed at significantly high levels in vitro and in vivo during RSV infection, CxCL10 appears to have a protective role to the host by reducing viral load and pathogenesis.\r\n Our previous studies have demonstrated the temporal production of CxCL10 during RSV infection [14] . Our first objective in the current studies was to determine the kinetics of CxCL10 induction during RSV infection, and evaluate the efficacy of our neutralizing antibody. Balb\/c mice were treated with anti-CxCL10 or control antibodies, and infected with 10 5 pfu of RSV. The levels of CxCL10 in the lungs were assessed by ELISA assay of lung homogenates. RSV infection in Balb\/c mice resulted in significant induction of CxCL10 in the lungs. As previously demonstrated, in control antibody treated mice, a dramatic induction of CxCL10 protein was observed beginning at day 3 post-infection, and persisting to day 8 post-infection ( Table 1) . Treatment of mice with neutralizing antibodies to CxCL10 significantly decreased CxCL10 levels in the lungs (Table 1 ). These data demonstrate that RSV infection results in the dramatic induction of CxCL10 in the lungs, which is significantly reduced via treatment with neutralizing antibodies.\r\n In our model, RSV infection in Balb\/c mice results in an increase in airway hyperreactivity (AHR), as well as mucus hypersecretion [15] . To determine whether CxCL10 plays a role in mediating RSV-induced pathophysiology, mice were treated with control or anti-CxCL10 neutralizing antibodies, infected with RSV, and AHR and mucus production were assessed. An increase in airway resistance was observed in response to methacholine in RSV infected mice (Fig. 1A) . Increased airway hyperresponsiveness was accompanied by increased transcription of the mucus associate genes Muc5ac and Gob5 (Fig. 1B) . Anti-CxCL10 antibody treatment significantly increased airway hyperreactivity relative to control antibody treated mice (Fig. 1A) . Similarly, CxCL10 neutralized animals exhibited increased PAS staining (Fig. 1B) and increased mucus associated gene expression (Fig. 1C) . Taken together, these data demonstrate that neutralization of CxCL10 enhances RSV-induced pathophysiology.\r\n To determine whether CxCL10 plays a role in the clearance of RSV, we determined viral load via plaque assay and via quantitative PCR for RSV G protein transcript. The levels of infectious virus (PFU) were similar in the lungs of control Ig and anti-CxCL10 treated mice at day 3 post infection ( Fig. 2A) . At day 8 post-infection, PFU via plaque assay were below the level of detection. Similarly, RSV G expression in the lungs was similar in both groups at day 3 post-infection (Fig. 2B) . At day eight, however, significantly more RSV G expression was present in the lungs of CxCL10 neutralized mice (Fig. 2B) . These results suggest that neutralization of CxCL10 leads to impaired clearance of RSV from the lungs.\r\n The expression of CxCR3 by T cells has generally been associated with Type 1 cellmediated responses, Th1 and cytotoxic T1 (Tc1). One might predict that if Th1\/Tc1 cells utilize CxCL10 in trafficking to the lungs, blockade of CxCL10 would likely result in a shift in the Th1\/Th2 balance in favor of Th2. To determine whether CxCL10 neutralization would result in an enhanced Th2 response in the lungs, the levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IFN\u03b3 were assessed in control Ig treated and CxCL10 neutralized RSV infected mice, as described in the Methods. No alterations in IFN\u03b3 or Type 2 cytokines were observed in CxCL10 neutralized mice, relative to controls (Fig. 3A) . However, a significant decrease in the Type 1 promoting cytokine IL-12p70 was observed in CxCL10 neutralized mice (Fig. 3A) . Additionally, a decrease in Ifn\u03b14 mRNA was observed in CxCL10 neutralized mice (Fig.  3B) . Thus, neutralization of CxCL10 decreased IL-12 protein and Ifn\u03b14 mRNA in the lungs, but these results were not associated with an increased Type 2 response in the lungs.\r\n To determine which immune cells may be affected by CxCL10 neutralization, we characterized the expression of CxCR3 on a variety of leukocyte subsets from the lungs of uninfected and RSV-infected mice. Consistent with reports in the literature, CxCR3 expression was detectable on all cell types assayed, including CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, B cells, NK cells, moncyte\/macrophages, as well as both mDC and pDC ( Fig. 4) [16] [17] [18] [19] . The frequency of CxCR3 expression was highest on NK cells and pDCs (Fig. 4) . Following RSV infection, however, only pDC maintained CxCR3 expression at high frequency (Fig 4) . These data indicate that a variety of cell types in the lungs express CxCR3 prior to, and during RSV infection, but only pDCs maintained CxCR3 expression at high frequency.\r\n The decreased Ifn\u03b14 and IL-12 in the lungs of CxCL10 neutralized mice led to a focus on lung dendritic cells. Resident lung dendritic cells (and macrophages) are among the first immune cells to encounter respiratory pathogens. Lung DC take up antigen and traffic to lung-draining lymph nodes, where they subsequently prime T cell responses. Pulmonary immunity to viruses and other pathogens also results in the accumulation of large numbers of dendritic cells in the lungs. To determine whether CxCL10 plays a role in the trafficking of these \"inflammatory\" dendritic cells to the lungs during pulmonary RSV infection, mice were treated with control or CxCL10 neutralizing antibodies and the numbers of myeloid (mDC) and plasmacytoid (pDC) dendritic cells in the lungs were assessed. In control IgG treated mice, RSV infection resulted in the dramatic recruitment of mDC to the lungs (Fig.  5A , approximately six-fold over uninfected controls -dashed line). Anti-CxCL10 treated mice had significantly fewer mDC in the lungs (Fig. 5A) . A smaller, but significant increase in pDCs was found in the lungs of RSV infected mice, relative to uninfected lungs (Fig. 5A ). CxCL10 neutralization had no effect on the accumulation of pDCs in the lungs of RSV infected mice. While the gate used to define pDC (CD45 + , low FSC, low SSC, CD11c int , B220 + ) may include some NK DC (~20% DX5 + in both control and CxCL10 neutralized mice, Table 2 ), 50% of the CD11c + B220 + cells co-express Gr-1 (Table 2 ). These data confirm that these cells are predominantly pDC, and CxCL10 neutralization did not affect pDC trafficking to the lungs. This result was unexpected, however, as pDC in the lungs expressed CxCR3 at higher levels than did mDC (Fig. 4B ). CxCL10 neutralization did not affect the recruitment of NK cells or monocyte\/macrophages (Fig. 5A ). These results demonstrate that CxCL10 promotes recruitment of mDC to the lungs during RSV infection, but since mDC expressed low levels of CxCR3, relative to pDC, this effect may be indirect.\r\n Pathogen recognition by dendritic cells via TLRs and other pattern recognition receptors results in the up-regulation of MHC II and costimulatory molecules, collectively referred to as \"maturation\". To determine whether CxCL10 plays a role in modulating dendritic cell maturation, we determined the expression MHC II and costimulatory molecules by dendritic cells from the lungs of anti-CxCL10 and control RSV-infected. The expression of MHC II was up-regulated in control RSV-infected mice, relative to controls (Fig. 5B ,C). There was a trend toward increased CD80 and CD86 expression following RSV infection, but this did not reach statistical significance (data not shown). The up-regulation of MHC II by mDC was significantly impaired in CxCL10 neutralized mice ( Fig. 5B ,C). These results suggest that CxCL10 promotes pulmonary dendritic cell activation\/maturation during RSV infection.\r\n We next wanted to determine whether CxCL10 neutralization would impact T cell responses during RSV infection. To this end, RSV-infected mice were treated with control or CxCL10 neutralizing antibodies and the numbers of lung CD4, CD8, and RSV M 82-90 Tetramerspecific CD8 T cells were determined from whole lungs. CxCL10 neutralization resulted in significantly decreased numbers of CD4, CD8, and RSV M 82-90 specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of RSV infected mice (Fig. 6 ). These data demonstrate that CxCL10 promotes RSVspecific T cell responses in the lungs.\r\n CxCR3 is the only known receptor for CxCL10 in mice. To determine whether blockade of CxCR3 would alter pathophysiology in a manner similar to CxCL10 neutralization, we administered anti-CxCR3 antibodies during RSV infection. Similar to anti CxCL10, neutralization of CxCR3 resulted in increased AHR (Fig. 7A) , again suggesting that this receptor-ligand system has an important role in activation of the appropriate anti-viral response. Additionally, CxCR3 neutralized mice had significantly increased Muc5ac expression and a trend toward increased Gob5 (Fig. 7B) , indicating that the overproduction of mucus corresponded with the changes in lung function (AHR). These data provide supporting evidence that the protective effects of CxCL10 during pulmonary RSV infection are mediated via CxCR3.\r\n Our in vivo data demonstrated that CxCL10 neutralization altered lung dendritic cell numbers in the lungs of RSV infected mice. Our next objective was to determine whether CxCL10 plays a direct role in modulating dendritic cells. To this end, bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) were infected in vitro with RSV (MOI=1) and treated with media alone or CxCL10. BMDC were CD11b + , consistent with published reports, and expressed moderate levels of CxCR3 (Fig. 8A ). RSV infection of BMDC induced dramatic increases in Ifn\u03b14, and CxCL10 treatment of RSV infected BMDC augmented IFN\u03b14 mRNA expression (Fig. 8B) . Interestingly, RSV replication\/transcription, as assessed by RSV G protein expression, was significantly decreased in CxCL10 treated BMDC, compared to DC treated with media alone (Fig. 8B) . The addtion of CxCL10 did not directly promote RSVinduced IL-12 production or MHC II up-regulation. These data suggest that CxCL10 promotes an \"anti-viral state\" in CxCR3 expressing DC, but does not directly influence DC maturation. Taken together with in vivo data, these results demonstrate that CxCL10 promotes Ifn\u03b14.\r\n The production of chemokines during the initial phases and throughout the infectious process in the lung provides a key role in immunity against and regulating pathogenesis of RSV. In the present study the role of CxCL10 and CxCR3 induced during RSV infection has been carefully explored using a murine model of disease. The neutralization of either CxCL10 or CxCR3 led to a similar exacerbation of disease pathogenesis with significant increases in AHR and mucus gene expression. These data correlated with the reduction in DC accumulation and viral specific CD8 + T cell numbers. The increased presence of virus gene expression after blocking this mediator cascade indicates that the activation event induced by this chemokine-receptor pair is critical to the function of the anti-viral responses. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that CxCL10 plays a role in modulating the host response to pulmonary RSV infection via promoting leukocyte recruitment and has a role in the trafficking and function of dendritic cells. The expression of CxCL10 has been observed in several models of respiratory virus infection, including Sendai, influenza, SARS-CoV, and adenovirus [20] [21] [22] [23] , as well as in neurogenic viral responses [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Thus, the responses induced by CxCL10 during the RSV-induced disease appear to be a general mechanism for responding to and\/or clearing viral infections.\r\n Neutralization of CxCL10 resulted in impaired type I IFN and dendritic cell maturation in the lungs of RSV infected mice. A number of studies have shown that type I IFN promotes dendritic cell maturation and costimulatory molecule expression [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that, in the absence of type I IFN signaling, RSV infected dendritic cells do not mature [34] . Thus, considerable evidence links type I IFN to dendritic cell maturation. Taken together, these results suggest that a likely mechanism for the dendritic cell maturation defect observed in CxCL10 neutralized mice (and consequently impaired T cell response) is a defect in the induction of type I IFN. We suggest that CxCL10 promotes type I IFN in CxCR3 expressing cells (likely pDC in vivo), which in turn promotes mDC maturation via type I IFN.\r\n Clinical studies have suggested that the severity of RSV-induced disease correlates with the influx of leukocytes that lead to the damage in the airways [3] . In particular, studies demonstrated that a number of other chemokines released within the airways during RSV infection, including CxCL8 (IL-8), CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), and CCL5 (RANTES), correlate to the most severe cases of RSV infection in infants [8] [9] [10] [35, 36] . Two of these chemokines, CCL3 and CCL5, have also been shown to be associated with inflammatory responses in animal models of RSV infection. CCL3 has been linked to the severity of primary RSVinduced inflammation as well as with multiple infections with RSV. Furthermore, Domachowske et al [37] demonstrated that infection of mice with paramyxovirus induces increased CCL3 related to eosinophil and PMN recruitment. Likewise, studies examining CCL5 indicate a significant impact on the pathophysiologic responses in primary RSV infection as well as the pattern of leukocyte recruitment and leukotriene release in the lungs during RSV-induced allergen exacerbated disease [13, 38] . Previous studies have also found that the overproduction of mucus and development of airway hyperreactivity is directly related to the expression and activation of CxCR2 (an IL-8 receptor homolog) in mice [39] . At the same time the overproduction of CxCL10, a chemokine clearly associated with viral clearance and disease resolution, is also highly induced by RSV [14, 40, 41] . The overexpression of CxCR3 and CxCL10 ligand appears to mediate a protective response to RSV and therefore this represents a balance for the CCL5\/CCR1-induced pathophysiology. In contrast, using a combination of reagents to block CCL5 or CCR1\u2212\/\u2212 mice numerous studies have shown that this highly expressed chemokine\/receptor pathway corresponds to a detrimental pathologic consequence [13, 37, 38, 42, 43] . Thus, it appears that the appropriate activation and recruitment of CxCR3 + DC and T cell populations mediate a less pathogenic immune environment, while blocking the CCR1\/CCL5-mediated pathway would provide a potential therapeutic strategy.\r\n Several pathways may induce the production of CxCL10 in the airways during viral infection. One well-characterized mechanism via TLR-mediated activation of CxCL10 has been demonstrated in several viral systems including RSV [12, [44] [45] [46] . Initial studies using Poly-I:C to activate CxCL10 production demonstrated that it was one of the highest expressed cytokines during the activation of multiple cell populations including epithelial cells, fibroblasts and astrocytes [44, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . More recently, the activation of other dsRNAmediated pathways have also been identified in the overproduction of CxCL10, as well as other IFN-inducible chemokines, including RIG-I and PKR [52] [53] [54] . Additionally, these pathways promote the activation of type I IFN production that provides additional increases in CxCL10 production, thus further augmenting its production within the system and enhancing the anti-viral environment.\r\n The expression of CxCR3 on distinct immune cell populations may be key for understanding the mechanism of RSV clearance in the lung. Studies originally identified CxCR3 expression on Th1 CD4 + T cells but not on Th2 T cell populations, indicating a clear dichotomy in recruitment and function [55, 56] . Subsequent studies have identified that CD8 + cytotoxic T cells can also differentially express chemokine receptors, depending upon their state of activation [57, 58] . While there is still a paucity of data that fully define the receptor patterns on CD8 + T cells, CxCR3 appears to be defining for efficient recruitment of cytotoxic T cells for viral clearance in several infection models [25, 26, [59] [60] [61] [62] . A mechanistic picture of the importance of CxCR3 in effective Th1 type anti-viral immunity continues to be developed but also includes the appropriate recruitment of DC populations [21, [63] [64] [65] [66] . In particular, the migration of pDCs into the lymph node from the site of viral infection was found to depend upon CxCR3 providing activation signals for lymph node DC to properly activate efficient anti-HSV immunity [21] . The latter studies suggested that CxCR3 recruited pDC provided type I IFN signals in the lymph node that allowed the activation of the T cell populations. In the present studies we have also observed that pDC preferentially express CxCR3. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated a key role of pDC in the clearance of RSV and the maintenance of an effective, non-pathogenic response to RSV [67, 68] . Overall, our studies identify a key chemokine receptor system that initiates and maintains the proper immune environment for anti-viral responses.\r\n Female Balb\/c mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions in enclosed filter-topped cages. Clean food and water were given ad libitum. The mice were handled and maintained using microisolator techniques, with daily veterinarian monitoring. Bedding from the mice was transferred weekly to cages of uninfected sentinel mice that were subsequently bled at weekly intervals and found to be negative for antibodies to mouse hepatitis virus, Sendai virus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis. The University Committee on Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA) at the University of Michigan approved all studies involving mice.\r\n RSV A strain was derived from a clinical isolate at the University of Michigan and was propagated in Hep2 cells. After adsorption, medium was added to the flask, and the infection was allowed to proceed until syncytia were observed. The cells were frozen a \u221280\u00b0C overnight, and the supernatant was harvested, clarified, and aliquoted. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay. For infections, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100mg\/kg) and xylazine (10mg\/kg). An incision was made over the trachea and mice were infected with ~1\u00d710 5 pfu of RSV in a volume of 40\u03bcl via intratracheal injection. The surgical wound was closed with surgical staples and mice recovered with minimal visible trauma.\r\n Rabbit anti-murine CxCL10 was generated by immunization of rabbits with recombinant protein. Rabbit anti-CxCR3 was generated by immunizing rabbits with a 16-mer peptide (PYDYGENESDFSDSPP) corresponding the NH 2 terminus of murine CxCR3, and has been shown to neutralize CxCR3 in vivo [26, 69] . CxCR3 expressing T cells and dendritic cells were detected in anti-CxCR3 treated mice, demonstrating that these antibodies are neutralizing, but not depleting. Serum from immunized rabbits were titered by ELISA and verified for minimal cross-reactivity to a panel of other chemokines and cytokines. Antibodies were purified from total serum by protein A-based affinity columns and the concentration of antibody was determined by spectrophotometry. Neutralizing antibodies (3.5mg\/mouse) were administered via intraperitoneal injection 1 day prior to RSV infection and then every 3 days. The efficacy of anti-CxCL10 antibody neutralization in the lungs is shown in Table 1 .\r\n Airway Hyperreactivity was assessed as previously described [15] . Briefly, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, intubated via cannulation of the trachea, and ventilated with a Harvard pump ventilator (~0.3ml tidal volume; 120 breaths per minute). Airway hyperreactivity was measured using a Buxco mouse plethysmograph and software for calculation of the measurements. Mice were administered a single optimized intravenous dose of methacholine (150mg\/kg), and the peak airway resistance was recorded.\r\n The upper left lobe of mouse lungs was used for protein analysis and RNA was isolated from the lower left lobe. Lung samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221270\u00b0C until use. For protein assays, lungs were homogenized in buffered saline containing Complete\u2122 protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). The concentration of protein was determined by sandwich ELISA using commercially available paired antibodies (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) RNA was isolated from lower left lobes of lungs using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and ~5\u03bcg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a volume of 25\u03bcl. Real time PCR was performed on cDNA using commercially available primers for GAPDH, and custom designed primers for RSV G protein transcript, Gob-5, and Muc5ac, as previously described [39] . Ifn\u03b14 expression was determined using SYBR green I dye, using the following primer sequences: mIFN\u03b14 F: CCT GTG TGA TGC AGG AAC C Ifn\u03b14 R: TCA CCT CCC AGG CAC AGA. Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH before the fold change was calculated.\r\n Right lobes of the lungs were removed and immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Lung samples were subsequently processed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and placed on L-lysine-coated slides. Periodic-acid Schiff (PAS) staining was done to identify mucus and mucus-secreting cells.\r\n Lung leukocytes were isolated from enzyme dispersed lung tissue. Right lungs from each mouse were excised, washed in PBS, minced and digested enzymatically for 45 minutes in 15 ml\/lung of digestion buffer (RPMI, 5% FCS, 1 mg\/ml collagenase (Roche Applied Science), and 30 \u03bcg\/ml DNase (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO)). Lung-associated lymph nodes (LALN) were dispersed similar to lungs, only 5mls of digestion buffer was used. Following erythrocyte lysis using ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) buffer, cells were washed, and resuspended in media (RPMI, 5% FCS). Total lung leukocyte numbers were assessed in the presence of trypan blue using a hemocytometer; viability was >85%. were defined by the following parameters: low auto fluorescence, CD45 + , CD11b hi , CD11c hi MHC-II + . Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were defined as: low forward scatter, low side scatter, CD45R\/B220 + , CD11c int . In some experiments, CD8 + T cells were stained with RSV M 82-90 tetramer (NIH Tetramer Core, Emory University, Atlanta GA). RSV M 82-90 has been previously shown to be the a dominant CD8 + epitope during RSV infection in Balb\/c mice [70] .\r\n Dendritic cells were grown from mouse bone marrow using minor modification of an establish method [71] . Bone marrow cells were flushed from the femurs and tibias of na\u00efve Balb\/c mice. Bone marrow cells were seeded at 2 \u00d7 10 5 \/ml in 30mls of BMDC media (RPMI+ 10% FCS, 1% Pen-Strep, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% sodium pyrvuate, 1% L-glutamine, 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 M 2-mercaptoethanol) with 10ng\/ml recombinant GM-CSF (R&D) in T150 flasks. At day 2, another 15 mls of BMDC media + GM-CSF was added to the culture. At days 4, 6, and 8, half of the media was removed, centrifuged and the cell pellet added back to the culture with fresh media + GM-CSF.

It is estimated by the CDC that up to 125,000 pediatric hospitalizations in the United States each year are due to RSV, at an annual cost of over $300,000,000 [2] . While RSV is especially detrimental in very young infants whose airways are small and easily occluded, RSV is also widely becoming recognized as an important pathogen in transplant recipients, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the elderly, as well as likely other patients with chronic lung disease, especially asthma. Clinical studies have suggested that the severity of RSV-induced disease correlates with the influx of leukocytes, resulting in damage to the airways [3] . More recently, chemokine production has been linked directly to recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed during the viral infection [11, 12] . Balb\/c mice were treated with anti-CxCL10 or control antibodies, and infected with 10 5 pfu of RSV. Taken together, these data demonstrate that neutralization of CxCL10 enhances RSV-induced pathophysiology. At day 8 post-infection, PFU via plaque assay were below the level of detection. At day eight, however, significantly more RSV G expression was present in the lungs of CxCL10 neutralized mice (Fig. These results suggest that neutralization of CxCL10 leads to impaired clearance of RSV from the lungs. Additionally, a decrease in Ifn\u03b14 mRNA was observed in CxCL10 neutralized mice (Fig. CxCL10 neutralization had no effect on the accumulation of pDCs in the lungs of RSV infected mice. While the gate used to define pDC (CD45 + , low FSC, low SSC, CD11c int , B220 + ) may include some NK DC (~20% DX5 + in both control and CxCL10 neutralized mice, Table 2 ), 50% of the CD11c + B220 + cells co-express Gr-1 (Table 2 ). These data confirm that these cells are predominantly pDC, and CxCL10 neutralization did not affect pDC trafficking to the lungs. These results demonstrate that CxCL10 promotes recruitment of mDC to the lungs during RSV infection, but since mDC expressed low levels of CxCR3, relative to pDC, this effect may be indirect. To determine whether CxCL10 plays a role in modulating dendritic cell maturation, we determined the expression MHC II and costimulatory molecules by dendritic cells from the lungs of anti-CxCL10 and control RSV-infected. To this end, RSV-infected mice were treated with control or CxCL10 neutralizing antibodies and the numbers of lung CD4, CD8, and RSV M 82-90 Tetramerspecific CD8 T cells were determined from whole lungs. In particular, studies demonstrated that a number of other chemokines released within the airways during RSV infection, including CxCL8 (IL-8), CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), and CCL5 (RANTES), correlate to the most severe cases of RSV infection in infants [8] [9] [10] [35, 36] . Furthermore, Domachowske et al [37] demonstrated that infection of mice with paramyxovirus induces increased CCL3 related to eosinophil and PMN recruitment. Likewise, studies examining CCL5 indicate a significant impact on the pathophysiologic responses in primary RSV infection as well as the pattern of leukocyte recruitment and leukotriene release in the lungs during RSV-induced allergen exacerbated disease [13, 38] . While there is still a paucity of data that fully define the receptor patterns on CD8 + T cells, CxCR3 appears to be defining for efficient recruitment of cytotoxic T cells for viral clearance in several infection models [25, 26, [59] [60] [61] [62] . Female Balb\/c mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions in enclosed filter-topped cages. Clean food and water were given ad libitum. The mice were handled and maintained using microisolator techniques, with daily veterinarian monitoring. Bedding from the mice was transferred weekly to cages of uninfected sentinel mice that were subsequently bled at weekly intervals and found to be negative for antibodies to mouse hepatitis virus, Sendai virus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis. The University Committee on Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA) at the University of Michigan approved all studies involving mice. RSV A strain was derived from a clinical isolate at the University of Michigan and was propagated in Hep2 cells. The cells were frozen a \u221280\u00b0C overnight, and the supernatant was harvested, clarified, and aliquoted. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay. An incision was made over the trachea and mice were infected with ~1\u00d710 5 pfu of RSV in a volume of 40\u03bcl via intratracheal injection. The surgical wound was closed with surgical staples and mice recovered with minimal visible trauma. Rabbit anti-CxCR3 was generated by immunizing rabbits with a 16-mer peptide (PYDYGENESDFSDSPP) corresponding the NH 2 terminus of murine CxCR3, and has been shown to neutralize CxCR3 in vivo [26, 69] . Airway hyperreactivity was measured using a Buxco mouse plethysmograph and software for calculation of the measurements. The upper left lobe of mouse lungs was used for protein analysis and RNA was isolated from the lower left lobe. Ifn\u03b14 expression was determined using SYBR green I dye, using the following primer sequences: mIFN\u03b14 F: CCT GTG TGA TGC AGG AAC C Ifn\u03b14 R: TCA CCT CCC AGG CAC AGA. Lung samples were subsequently processed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and placed on L-lysine-coated slides. Periodic-acid Schiff (PAS) staining was done to identify mucus and mucus-secreting cells. Right lungs from each mouse were excised, washed in PBS, minced and digested enzymatically for 45 minutes in 15 ml\/lung of digestion buffer (RPMI, 5% FCS, 1 mg\/ml collagenase (Roche Applied Science), and 30 \u03bcg\/ml DNase (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO)). Lung-associated lymph nodes (LALN) were dispersed similar to lungs, only 5mls of digestion buffer was used. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were defined as: low forward scatter, low side scatter, CD45R\/B220 + , CD11c int . Dendritic cells were grown from mouse bone marrow using minor modification of an establish method [71] . At days 4, 6, and 8, half of the media was removed, centrifuged and the cell pellet added back to the culture with fresh media + GM-CSF. Non-adherent cells were harvested at day ten, and the resulting cells were >85% CD11c + . For airway responses and cytokine levels, p values were calculated using the two tailed student's t test, assuming equal or unequal variance, as dictated by F test.

This study aimed to determine the role and mechanism of action of polysaccharides isolated from HC (HCP) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in the mice. Materials and methods: LPS was delivered by the intratracheal route to Balb\/c mice 2 h before HCP (40, 80 and 160 mg\/kg) administration. Results: The number of total cells, protein and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the wet\/dry weight ratio (w\/d) of lungs and pulmonary pathology of each mouse were analyzed, it was found that HCP significantly alleviated ALI induced by LPS. Moreover, in lungs of mice, it was found that the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 and complement deposition were significantly decreased by HCP treatment. In vitro assays showed that C5a, a complement activation product, induced significant macrophage migration and treatment with HCP prevented it. The in vitro results also proved that LPS increased nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1\u03b2) production, and HCP antagonized these effects of LPS. It was also found that HCP alone augmented secretion of some pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion: These results indicate that HCP may alleviate LPS induced lung inflammatory injury, which may be associated with its inhibitory effect on the over activation of complement and macrophages. This suggests a potential role to treat ALI.","text_body":"Acute lung injury (ALI) and its most severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by acute lung inflammation and edema, account for high rates of morbidity and mortality in humans (Fulkerson et al., 1996; McMullen et al., 2012) . Some reports showed that complement activation, which can cause inflammatory cells recruitment to the alveolar-capillary membrane, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALI Robbins et al., 1987) . As one of the complement activation products, C5a is a strong chemoattractant that increases the infiltration of activated neutrophils and macrophages into the pulmonary vasculature, lung interstitium, and alveolar space, resulting in immune response and disruption of the alveolar epithelial barrier (Flierl et al., 2008; Guo and Ward, 2005) . Intensive investigations are still needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of ALI, which remains obscure and is generally believed to be associated with over-activation of complement system, the recruitment of leukocyte, and inflammation mediated by inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide (NO), TNF-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 (Naito et al., 2013; Tsai et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2012) .\r\n Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (HC, Saururaceae family) is a perennial herb and time-honored traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It has a thin stalk and heart-shaped leaf, and reaches an average length of 15-50 cm. It is affluently distributed in the central, southeast and southwest regions of China and is harvested in summer or autumn (Yang and Jiang, 2009; Meng et al., 2009 ). HC possesses a large range of pharmacological activities, such as antiviral, anti-oxidative effects (Hayashi et al., 1995) . During severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in late 2002 to mid-2003, a TCM formula was proposed to general public as a preventive measure by the State Administration of TCM of China. HC was one of the six ingredients in this formula, owing to its abilities to diminish inflammation (Lau et al., 2008; Zhang and Chen, 2008) . Some reports showed that polysaccharides from plants possessed the activities of modulating host responses and improving immunity (Graff et al., 2009; Holderness et al., 2011; Lee and Hong, 2011) . It is reasonable to presume that polysaccharides extracted from HC may exhibit the inhibitory effects against ALI.\r\n To assure our hypothesis and further make clear the possible mechanisms, LPS was used, a major cell wall component of bacteria and powerful initiators of inflammatory reaction to induce the model in mice. The model established through intratracheal instillation of LPS to mice provides a good experimental model of ALI\/ARDS to mimic the inflammatory response in patients (Naito et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2012) . Although various factors such as complement activities and inflammatory cells are involved in these responses, LPS recognition by the immune sentinel cells is a vital step to initiate inflammatory process in this model (Akira and Takeda, 2004) . Toll-like receptors (TLRs) has been considered to play critical roles in immune system by recognizing microbial pathogens and initiating innate and adaptive immune responses. Of all the TLRs, TLR4 specifically senses LPS and transmits signals to host cells like macrophages, and then triggers signal transduction to up-regulate inflammatory cytokines and therefore causes inflammation (Akira and Takeda, 2004; Deng et al., 2013) .\r\n In this study, the therapeutic effects and the mechanisms of HCP on the experimental model of ALI were investigated.\r\n LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5) and Polymyxin B (PB) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate Injection (DEX, No. 1303040, used as the positive control in LPS-induced ALI model) was purchased from Chongqing Laimei Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Chongqing, China) . Cell culture medium (RPMI-1640) and endotoxin-free fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). Dexamethasone (DEX, No.D4902, used \r\n Male BALB\/c mice (5-8 weeks) were obtained from Slaccas-Shanghai Lab Animal Ltd. (SPF II Certificate; No. SCXK2012-0002) and housed in collective cages under a 12 h light\/dark cycle, with free access to food and water.\r\n All animals received humane care in compliance with the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" published by the National Institutes of Health. All the study protocols were approved by the Animal Ethical Committee of School of Pharmacy, Fudan University (approved identification: 2013-50). All the surgeries were performed under urethane anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.\r\n The dried whole plants of HC were purchased from Huayu Materia Medica Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Verification of identity was carried out by Dr. Yan Lu (Fudan University, Shanghai, China), and the voucher specimen (DFC-YXC-2006072601 ) was deposited at the Herbarium of Materia Medica, Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Fudan University, Shanghai, PR China.\r\n The isolation and chromatographic studies of polysaccharides were accomplished similar as previously described by Cheng et al. (2010) . The dried whole plants (1 kg) of HC were grounded in a high-speed rotary cutting mill into fine particles and defatted with 15 L 95% ethanol for 24 h. The residue was dried in air and it weighed about 913 g, and was extracted in 27.39 L (almost 30 times residue weight) hot water in 90\u00b0C. The extraction process was repeated 3 times and almost 75 L extracting solution was collected. The hot water extract was concentrated to 7.6 L and then 40.5 L 95% ethanol was added. After 24 h, it was centrifuged and the deposition was redissolved in 1.5 L water. The proteins existed in water solution were precipitated by adding 7% trichloroacetic acid at 4\u00b0C. Then the supernatant was neutralized and was dialyzed in the running water for 3 days. The polysaccharides (15.3 g) were made as the supernatant was concentrated and then lyophilized for the following experiments.\r\n HCP was a dark-brown powder and was soluble in water. The total carbohydrate and uronic acid contents were determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid and m-hydroxybiphenyl methods respectively, using D-galactose and D-galacturonic acid as respective standards. HCP comprises 77.21% of total carbohydrate and 36.69% of uronic acid. Furthermore, the total protein content was measured using Coomassie brilliant blue staining and the protein content in HCP was 6.17%. The monosaccharide composition of HCP was determined by gas chromatographic analysis, and HCP is mainly composed of Glc, Gal, Ara and Rha in the ratio of 3.40:2.14:1.17:1.00, along with trace of Man and Xyl. High-performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC) analysis showed that HCP contains one major polysaccharide with several minor ones (Fig. 1) .\r\n The content of LPS in HCP was 5.5 ng\/100 \u03bcg (55 ppm), assayed by the limulus amebocyte lysate reagent method, which has been widely used (Chang and Sack, 2001; Ryder et al., 1976) . To examine the anti-inflammatory effects of HCP (1, 10, and 100 \u03bcg\/ml) in some of the following experiments, PB, a well-characterized LPS inhibitor (Jacobs and Morrison, 1977) , was selected to pretreat with HCP at 37\u00b0C for 24 h to eliminate the possibility that the contamination of endotoxin in HCP may affect the experiment results (Wu et al., 2013) .\r\n The mice were randomly assigned to six groups (n \u00bc8): Shamoperated animals group (sham group, n \u00bc9), LPS alone group (model group), LPS \u00feHCP treated group (HCP 40 mg\/kg group, HCP 80 mg\/kg group, HCP 160 mg\/kg group) and LPS \u00feDEX (4 mg\/kg) treated group (DEX group).The doses of these drugs and LPS were based on our previous studies and preliminary experiments.\r\n HCP was dissolved in normal saline (NS) and administered orally by gavage (p.o.). The model of ALI was employed as previously described method by Li et al. (2012) . Mice were anesthetized with 20% urethane before intratracheal instillation (i.t.) of NS (sham group, i.t.) or LPS (E. coli 055:B5, 3 mg\/kg i.t.). HCP was administered intragastrically (i.g.) 2 h after LPS instillation. DEX at 4 mg\/kg was given via tail vein (i.v.) 2 h after LPS exposure as a positive control.\r\n Twenty-four hour after LPS exposure, mice were euthanized. The right lungs were ligated, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained on the left lung using 0.5 ml normal saline four times. After centrifugation (4\u00b0C, 1000g, 10 min), the cell-free supernatants were harvested and stored at \u00c080\u00b0C for subsequent analysis, and the cell pellets were re-suspended in 200 mL NS for cell counts using a hemocytometer as previously described by Xie et al. (2012) . The levels of TNF-\u03b1 and protein in BALF were measured by mouse TNF-\u03b1 ELISA kit and BCA protein assay kit respectively according to the manufacturer's instructions.\r\n To evaluate the severity of tissue edema, the lung w\/d was calculated. After euthanasia of mice, the inferior lobe of right lungs were excised and measured immediately to obtain the \"wet weight\", and then dried in an oven to constant weight at 50\u00b0C for 72 h and weighed again to obtain the \"dry weight\".\r\n The superior lobe of right lung was removed and fixed immediately in 4% formaldehyde in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and used for histological evaluation. The tissue fixed in formalin was dehydrated and embedded in paraffin and sections (5 \u03bcm) were mounted on glass slide and stained with H&E to evaluate the severity of pneumonia.\r\n Immunohistochemical staining was performed as previously described by Chiou et al. (2004) and Jiang et al. (2012) . Hightemperature antigen retrieval was performed by immersion of the deparaffinized slides in 10 mM trisodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a water bath at 99\u00b0C for 20 min. After quenching of endogenous peroxidase with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol (v\/v) for 15 min, the non-specific binding sites of the sections were blocked with 5% BSA. The sections were then incubated with rabbit anti-C3d antibody (1:300) or murine monoclonal anti-TLR4 antibody (1:100, Abcam) at 4\u00b0C overnight in a humidified chamber, and followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C with HRP-conjugated goat antirabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody for 30 min.\r\n Immunohistochemical staining of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and macrophages were performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Deparaffinized sections were treated with 20 \u03bcg\/ml of proteinase K for 15 min at 37\u00b0C before antigen retrieval. After quenching of endogenous peroxidase and then blocking for 30 min with normal rabbit serum (Vector), the sections were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight in a humidified chamber with rat monoclonal Ly-6G\/Ly-6C (Gr-1) (1:100, clone: RB6-8C5; BioLegend) to PMNs or rat monoclonal F4\/80 antibody (1:100, clone Cl:A3-1; AbD Serotec ) to lung macrophages. The next day, the sections were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with a rabbit anti rat secondary antibody labeled with biotin and then with HRPconjugated ABC Reagent. (VECTASTAIN s Elite ABC-Peroxidase Kit, Cat. No. PK-6104, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).\r\n Slices were visualized using chromogenic substrate solution DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin, and then observed under a microscope.\r\n Male BALB\/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1 ml of 5% sodium thioglycollate medium. Mice were sacrificed 4 days after injection and the peritoneal cavities were flushed with 5 ml of chilled RPMI 1640 medium and the peritoneal lavage fluids were centrifuged at 80g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to isolate peritoneal macrophages (Cheng et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2013) .\r\n All the procedures described here were carried out in aseptic conditions, and the materials were previously sterilized and pyrogen-free.\r\n The in vitro anti-complement activity of the HCP was examined according to a previously described method by Xie et al. (2012) . To prepare sensitized erythrocytes (EAs), the 2% sheep erythrocytes were pre-incubated with rabbit anti-sheep erythrocyte antibody (1:1000) in equal volumes. The samples were diluted in isotonic veronal-buffered saline (VBS 2 \u00fe ) (containing 0.5 mM Mg 2 \u00fe and 0.15 mM Ca 2 \u00fe ). Guinea pig serum was used as the source of complement described by Xie et al. (2012) . According to our preliminary experiment, the 1:60 diluted Guinea pig serum was able to give submaximal lysis in the absence of complement inhibitors, and was chosen as the complement source. As a positive control, Suramin (300 \u03bcg\/ml) was able to inhibit 100% of the lysis.\r\n The tested samples (200 \u03bcL) were mixed with 200 \u03bcL of Guinea pig serum, and then, 200 \u03bcL of EAs was added. The mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. The different assay controls were incubated in the same conditions: (1) vehicle control: 200 \u03bcL EAs in 400 \u03bcL VBS 2 \u00fe ; (2) 100% lysis: 200 \u03bcL EAs in 400 \u03bcL ultrapure water;\r\n (3) 0% lysis: 100 \u03bcL 2% non-sensitized sheep erythrocytes and 200 \u03bcL Guinea pig serum in 300 \u03bcL VBS 2 \u00fe ; and (4) samples background: 200 \u03bcL of each dilution of HCP sample in 400 \u03bcL VBS 2 \u00fe . The mixtures were centrifuged (1000g, 10 min) immediately at 4\u00b0C after incubation, and the optical density of the supernatant was measured at 405 nm on a well scanner (Labsystems Dragon). Results were Fig. 1 . High-performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC) of HCP. HCP was analyzed on a TSK GMPWXL gel filtration column (7.6 mm \u00c2 300 mm, TOSOH), eluted with ultrapure water at a flow rate of 1.0 ml\/min, and detected at 254 nm. indicated in percentage of hemolytic inhibition.

Cell migration was assessed using a 24-well 8-mm pore chemotaxis chamber (Chiou et al., 2004 ) (Transwell, Corning Costar). The cells (1 \u00c2 10 5 cells\/ chamber) were plated in the upper chamber of Transwell inserts (Corning) while C5a (50 ng\/ml) was added in the lower compartment as a stimulus without or with HCP (1, 10, and 100 \u03bcg\/ml).\r\n After incubation for 4 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2, the inserts were removed, and the inner surface was rinsed and wiped with a little lump of cotton to remove nonmigrated cells. The cells on the outside of the inserts were formalin-fixed and then stained using crystal violet. The inserts were observed under a microscope. Cells in each insert were counted in 10 randomly selected fields at \u00c2 400 magnification to evaluate chemotaxis. Chemotaxis index (CI)\u00bccells of sample\/cells of control \u00c2 100%.

Spontaneous migration in 0.1% BSA-RPMI 1640 served as control and was designed as a basic migration for each experiment, and complement 5 a-induced cell migration in 0.1% BSA -RPMI 1640 acted as model group.\r\n The cells were resuspended with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and cultured in 96-well plates (1 \u00c2 10 6 cells\/well). After incubation for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 , the cells were washed two times to remove the non-adherent cells.\r\n Cells (1 \u00c2 10 6 cells\/ml) were incubated with or without LPS\r\n (1 \u03bcg\/ml), while HCP was added in at the same time, for 24 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 , and then, the supernatant of the culture media was collected to evaluate the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits according to the manufacturer's instruction. The content of nitric oxide in the culture media was measured according to the colorimetric method described previously by Bakker et al. (2009) , Joh and Kim (2010), using Griess reagent. The culture medium (60 \u03bcl) was combined with an equal volume of Griess reagent [mixture of equal volume of 1% sulfanilamide in 5% H 3 PO 4 and 0.1% N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in H 2 O] in a 96-well flate-bottom microtiter plate and incubated for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. Then the optical densities were measured at 540 nm using a spectrophotometer and the concentration of nitrite was determined by a standard curve.\r\n Data were expressed as means 7standard deviation (S.D.). One-way ANOVA was performed for multiple group comparisons. If data were found to have significant changes, post-hoc comparisons were performed using Fisher's PLSD. P o0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\r\n 3.1.1. Effect of HCP on histopathological changes in lungs of ALI mice\r\n Lung tissues from ALI model group exhibited widespread pulmonary alveolar wall thickness accompanied by edema, obvious infiltration of inflammatory cells, and severe hemorrhage in the alveolus. While in sham group, the lungs showed a normal structure and these lesions were not apparent. Treatment with HCP or DEX obviously ameliorated these injuries ( Fig. 2A) .\r\n Twenty-four hour after LPS administration, total cells and TNF\u03b1 production in BALF were assessed. Dramatic increases were observed in total cells and TNF-\u03b1 production after LPS instillation compared to those of sham group (P o0.001, as shown in Fig. 2B and C). Compared with vehicle treated ALI group, HCP (40, 80 and 160 mg\/kg) and DEX (4 mg\/kg) treated ALI group exhibited decreased total cells (Po 0.05) and TNF-\u03b1 concentration (Po 0.01) in BALF of mice.\r\n The concentration of protein in BALF supernatant was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2D , compared with sham group, the levels of protein were significantly elevated (P o0.001) in model group. Treatments with HCP (40, 80, and 160 mg\/kg) or DEX (4 mg\/kg) markedly reduced the concentration of protein as compared with model group (P o0.05).\r\n The w\/d were significantly elevated in vehicle treated model group compared with sham group (Fig. 2E ). By comparison, such elevations were blunted by HCP (80 and 160 mg\/kg) and DEX treatment (P o0.05)\r\n To determine whether HCP might affect ALI by reducing complement deposition in the lungs of mice, the lung tissue sections were stained to examine the presence of C3d. In agreement with our previous studies , immunohistochemistry showed very low levels of staining for complement deposition in the lungs of sham group (Fig. 3A) . The model group exhibited intense immunostaining of C3d in lung tissue. Treatments with HCP (40, 80, and 160 mg\/kg) and DEX (4 mg\/kg) after instillation of LPS significantly inhibited C3d deposition in lung tissue.\r\n The effect of HCP on TLR4 expression in lungs of mice was evaluated. The results showed intense immunostaining for TLR4 expression in lung tissue of model group (Fig. 3B ). Compared with model group, HCP (40, 80 and 160 mg\/kg) and DEX treated ALI group exhibited relatively low levels of staining in lung tissue.\r\n The effect of HCP on attenuating the infiltration of PMNs and macrophages in lung tissue of mice was evaluated. The results showed intense immunostaining for PMNs (Fig. 3C ) and macrophages (Fig. 3D) infiltration in lungs of model group. Compared with model group, HCP (40, 80 and 160 mg\/kg) and DEX treated ALI group exhibited relatively low levels of staining in lung tissue.\r\n The anti-complementary activities of HCP were evaluated and the polysaccharides significantly inhibited the hemolysis of sensitized sheep erythrocytes when incubated with Guinea pig serum (IC 50 \u00bc0.348 70.012 mg\/ml) (As shown in Fig. 4) .\r\n The chemotactic effect on peritoneal macrophages was performed to evaluate whether HCP could inhibit macrophage migration. As shown in Fig. 5A , macrophages without C5a displayed no chemotaxis and low random migration (8.23 71.26 \r\n To clarify whether HCP could lessen the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, which have been demonstrated to be associated with the lung injury in ALI (Chua et al., 2007) , the peritoneal macrophages were isolated and cultured. The influences of HCP on iNOS\/NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-10 production were also evaluated. As shown in Fig. 6 , stimulation with LPS\r\n (1 \u03bcg\/ml) significantly augmented the levels of NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 (Po 0.001; Fig. 6 ). In contrast, HCP (10, 100 \u03bcg\/ml) and DEX (10 \u03bcM) markedly suppressed levels of those inflammatory mediators after LPS administration (Po0.001; Fig. 6A -D). The level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was greatly elevated by LPS (P o0.001; Fig. 6E ). HCP (1, 10, and 100 \u03bcg\/ml) further promoted the IL-10 production in LPS-stimulated cells (Po 0.001). The production of NO and cytokines in macrophages treated with HCP (1, 10, and 100 \u03bcg\/ml) alone was investigated to determine whether HCP itself can affect the immunologic functions of macrophages. Substantial increases in NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-10 were observed (P o0.05) in the HCP (100 \u03bcg\/m) treatment group (Fig. 7 A-E) .\r\n To exclude the possibility that the results above were due to LPS contamination in the drug, HCP was pretreated with PB (30 \u03bcg\/ml), a LPS inhibitor, at 37\u00b0C for 24 h before being added to the cell cultures. As seen in Fig. 7 , significantly lower levels of NO, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-10 were observed in the HCP with PB treatment group, compared with the HCP without PB group (Po 0.05).\r\n HC is used as a folk therapy against influenza, asthma, allergy, cancer (Yang and Jiang, 2009) , and also had the anti-inflammatory activity (Lee et al., 2013) . In China, the traditional medicines are mostly prepared in a form of apozem. At present, it is becoming an increasing fascinating approach to use polysaccharides to treat various inflammatory diseases because polysaccharides are major components in the decoction and have remarkable therapeutic effects and relatively low toxicity (Cheng et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2012; Schepetkin and Quinn, 2006) .\r\n In the present study, intratracheal instillation of LPS was used to produce the ALI model in mice to mimic the inflammatory response in patients . Instillation of 3 mg\/kg LPS into the trachea of mice activated inflammatory cascades within two hours, causing lung injury characterized by accumulation of leukocyte, proteinaceous alveolar exudates, pulmonary edema and hemorrhagic spots.\r\n The results of this study demonstrated the effectiveness of the isolated natural HCP in ameliorating experimental lung injury in mice. HCP, given orally, consistently ameliorated LPS-induced lung injury, with a direct reduction in lung w\/d, total cell counts, inflammatory cells infiltration, protein and TNF-\u03b1 concentration in BALF. Of interest, it was observed that HCP produced a marked decrease in TLR4 expression as seen in lung tissue. In addition, the present research clearly showed that HCP treatment consistently suppressed activation of complement both in vivo and in vitro.\r\n In healthy individuals, the complement system defends the body against microbial pathogens as an effective innate immune mechanism of host. However, over activation of complement has also been involved in many forms of acute inflammatory, including ALI (Linton and Morgan, 1999) . As a kind of complement protein split product, C5a exerts a broad spectrum of functions. C5a appears to contribute to promoting and perpetuating inflammatory reactions. It is also a potent chemoattractant and is implicated in the recruitment of many inflammatory cells like neutrophils and macrophages (Schmid et al., 1997) . In our experiment, pre-incubation of HCP inhibited the hemolysis of sensitized sheep erythrocytes when complement was present. Besides, complement deposition was found in LPS-mediated ALI and relevantly treatment with HCP prevented the deposition. These effects indicate that HCP inhibit the activation of complement system in model mice, consequently, suppress the release of various protein split products including C5a, which may probably contribute to the heavy infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in the lung.\r\n Leukocyte infiltration is a hallmark of severe lung injury. According to Silva (2010) , in the early stage of the lung injury, macrophages detect the pathogens and then recruit monocytes, which mature into inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils. However, the redundant recruitment could lead to the aggregation of macrophages and neutrophils in lungs of ALI mice. As discussed earlier, C5a is one of the most inflammatory peptides among the complement activation products, and has chemotactic activity for monocytes and macrophages. In the experiments, the peritoneal macrophages were cultured and the chemotactic effects in the presence of HCP were investigated. Results showed that C5a induced significant migration and treatment with HCP prevented it, which indicates that HCP could directly inhibit the migration, consequently, might decrease the influx of inflammatory cells in lungs of model mice, leading to the palliation of inflammation.\r\n Alveolar macrophages, a large mononuclear phagocytes located in the alveolar compartment of the lungs, play a critical role to defend the lungs against inflammatory conditions by producing and releasing a numerous of inflammatory mediators (Niesler et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2006) , including cytokines, chemokines, and complement factors. A pro-inflammatory micromilieu can be caused by these mediators (Sharma et al., 2007) which may function as chemoattractants for invading cells or stimulate local cells (Seitz et al., 2010) . In addition to suppression of macrophage migration, the beneficial action of HCP in ameliorating ALI in mice is also likely associated with its ability to prevent the overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators in macrophages. High levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1 generated in pathophysiological conditions lead to the development of inflammatory responses and cytotoxicity, which may have direct role in mediating tissue damage (Giebelen et al., 2007) . The present study demonstrated that levels of NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 from LPS-stimulated macrophages were clearly suppressed in the presence of HCP in vitro, as was consistent with the reduction in BALF TNF-\u03b1 in LPS-induced ALI mice after HCP treatment. Interestingly, in vitro treatment with HCP markedly elevated IL-10 secretion, a relevant anti-inflammatory cytokine, in the macrophage culture supernatant after LPS administration.\r\n The present study demonstrated that, HCP alone stimulated mild expression of inflammatory cytokines, including NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. However, polysaccharides extracted from natural plant sources such as HC can be easily contaminated by LPS during the isolation process, which may interfere with biological evaluation studies (de Santana et al., 2012) . To further investigate whether HCP-induced cytokines expression could be just a consequence of LPS contamination in polysaccharides, the critical experiments were repeated in the presence of PB, a drug that can bind to the lipid A portion of LPS to exclude cell activation by LPS (Coyne and Fenwick, 1993; Stokes et al., 1989) . According to our previous study, 30 \u03bcg\/ml PB is sufficient to inhibit up to 10 ng\/ml LPS, and has no effect on cell viability. This study showed that treatment with PB suppressed but did not completely abolish HCP- induced secretion of these inflammatory mediators. It is reasonable to suggest that it is HCP but not contaminated LPS in HCP that functions to modulate the secretion of macrophages. Taking the results above into account, HCP decreases the LPS-induced excessive production of NO and cytokines in inflammatory condition but enhances the immunologic functions in physiologic level. This phenomenon demonstrates that HCP may have biphasic actions.\r\n As a pattern recognition receptor that responds to LPS, TLR4 is up-regulated in many inflammatory diseases induced by LPS (Deng et al., 2013) . This study showed that HCP strikingly reduced the expression of TLR4 in lung tissue. This result demonstrated that HCP might inhibit the interaction between LPS and its receptor-TLR4 to restrict the inflammatory process in the lung.\r\n HCP attenuated LPS-induced lung injury, as evidenced by an inhibition of lung w\/d, protein level, TNF-\u03b1 concentration, and inflammatory cells aggregation in BALF. In vivo, HCP decreased the expression of TLR4 and the deposition of complement in the lungs of ALI mice, and in vitro, HCP attenuated C5a-induced chemotaxis and LPS-induced secretion of inflammatory mediators on macrophages. These results suggested that the mechanism of HCP seems to be multifactorial to reduce inflammatory responses in lung. And the most important factor was probably associated with the inhibition of the over activation of complement and macrophages. Fig. 6 .

Conclusion: The findings provide an insight into the preventive and therapeutic potentials of Cordyceps for the treatment of lung fibrosis.","text_body":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, irreversible and debilitating lung disease showing progressive scarring of the alveolar tissue and leading to difficulty in breathing. The etiology of this disease is largely unknown but it is generally considered to be a result of exposure to occupational and\/or environmental risk factors acting in concert with genetic susceptibility to fibrosis (Antoniou et al., 2007) . There are more than 5 million people worldwide suffering from this disease, and there is no effective treatment or a cure. Most patients die from this lung disorder within 5 years of diagnosis (Verma and Slutsky, 2007) .\r\n IPF has a poor prognosis (Kinnula and Myll\u00e4rniemi, 2008) , and it normally initiates inflammation and oxidant production in the site of injury at early stage. It is characterized by transdifferentiation of the epithelial cells, accumulation of fibroblasts\/myofibroblasts, formation of fibroblastic foci, and distortion of the lung architecture (Antoniou et al., 2007) . The change of epithelial cobblestone-like morphology to myofibroblast phenotype through epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), and the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin with a concomitant disruption of E-cadherin junction are the hallmarks for IPF. Many patients, however, show little evidence of inflammation, and anti-inflammatory treatments have little impact on the disease (Willis et al., 2006) .\r\n The development and progression of IPF is associated with an activation of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-b1), which induces excessive production and deposition of collagen and extracellular matrix (ECM) by the myofibroblasts, as well as disruption of the basement membrane by an imbalance of gelatinases (matrix metalloproteinases) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (MMP\/TIMP) (Coward et al., 2010) . The coupling of mitochondrial dysfunction with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production also aggravates the epithelial cell damage in idiopathic interstitial disorder (Kabuyama et al., 2010) .\r\n Cordyceps sinensis (Dong-Chong-Xia-Cao, abbreviated as CS) is an entomogenous fungus whose mycelia grow inside the pupae or larvae of Lepidoptera moth in the autumn, with its fruiting body protruding from the dead insect body during the summer. A renowned Chinese medicine to soothe the lung, CS is now often used for the treatment of respiratory diseases and strengthening immune responses. It has also been reported to be an antioxidant and an inhibitor of angiogenesis. Cordyceps extracts have been shown to relieve fibrosis in the liver (Das et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 1998a Zhu et al., , 1998b , kidney (Chai et al., 2009) , and lung (Wang et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2011) through an inhibition of TGF-b1 expression (Wang et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2011) and promotion of collagen degradation (Li et al., 2006a) . The dried form of CS contains ergosterol, polysaccharides, glycoprotein and peptides. Adenosine and cordycepin (3 0 -deoxyadenosine) are the major components (Li et al., 2006b; Tsai et al., 2010) and they have been demonstrated to modulate cell activation and alter cell morphology (Shin et al., 2009) . Several therapeutic strategies targeting various stages of fibrogenesis are being investigated (Selman et al., 2011) , and it is the objective of the present study to explore the target(s) of CS in the relief of lung fibrosis and to gain insight into its underlying mechanisms.\r\n Dried Cordyceps sinensis (Berk.) Sacc. (containing the myceliafilled insect body and the fungal fruiting body) originated from Tibet was donated by the Eu Yan Sang (Hong Kong) Ltd. The herbal materials were authenticated by Prof. Songming Liang of the School of Chinese Medicine (SCM), the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and voucher specimens have been deposited in the herbarium of the SCM. The herbal drug was ground to powder, passed through a sieve of aperture no. 6, and stored at 41 C until use. To mimic the traditional route of administration, the powder was suspended in distilled water and given to the animals intragastrically using a feeding tube.\r\n All experiments were performed in accordance with the Hong Kong Guidelines for Animal Welfare and the protocols were approved by the Animal Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Ref. nos. 08\/026\/ERG and 461908).\r\n Male Sprague-Dawley rats of 8-12 weeks old were housed in normal laboratory conditions at 21721 C under a 12\/12 lightdark cycle. Pulmonary fibrosis was induced by intra-tracheal administration of a single dose of 2.5 mg\/kg of bleomycin (BLM, Nippon Kayaku Co. Ltd., Japan) dissolved in 0.25 mL of physiological saline (Bonniaud et al., 2005) (Day 1). Pulmonary fibrosis developed in 2 weeks (Day 14), confirmed by morphological changes in the lungs and an accumulation of excessive interstitial collagen (Chaudhary et al., 2006) . Intragastric administration of CS during the course of fibrosis development (Days 1-14 after BLM administration) was considered prophylactic\/preventive, whereas administration of CS after fibrosis had already developed (Days 14-28) was considered therapeutic in the present protocol.\r\n In order to determine an optimal dose of CS, Experiment 1 was performed in which 32 rats were equally and randomly divided into four groups, namely (a) bleomycin-induced fibrosis rats (BLM group), (b) low-dose CS treatment (CS1) (0.54 g\/kg body weight, equivalent to 2-fold human dose of 0.27 g\/kg) (Hui and Chan, 2006) , (c) high-dose CS treatment (CS2) (1.35 g\/kg body weight, 5-fold human dose), and (d) normal animals receiving vehicle (CTL) as sham controls. The CS1 and CS2 groups of animals received daily intragastric administration of CS1 or CS2 (each 0.5 mL) for 14 days before the lung tissues were collected for morphological and biochemical analyses.\r\n All rats survived BLM treatment. The results of Experiment 1 showed more potent antifibrotic activity in the CS2 group. A dose of CS at 1.35 g\/kg was therefore used in the subsequent time course study in Experiment 2 (see Scheme 1). Thus, forty rats were divided into five groups: four groups received intra-tracheal administration of BLM, and the fifth group only received water as sham control (CTL). Among the four groups of BLM-treated rats, three groups received daily CS2 dose (1.35 g\/kg) starting from Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15, respectively, and they were all sacrificed on Day 28. One group of fibrotic rats received water to serve as positive lung fibrosis control.\r\n Rats were anaesthetized by 3.5% chloral hydrate (1 mL\/100 g body weight) and the lungs were removed and divided into two halves: the right lung was used for differential alveolar cell counts by May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain, and the left lung was further separated into two portions: The upper portion fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses, and the lower portion frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA analysis and histochemical analysis of ROS production (oxidative stress) in alveolar tissues.\r\n Alveolar cells were collected from right lungs of treated and untreated rats by bronchoalveolar lavage with physiological saline. Cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were spread on clean glass slides using a Thermo Shandon Cytospin 2 centrifuge (Southern Products Ltd., Cheshire, UK), air-dried, fixed with ethanol, and stained with May Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa. Total cell number and percentages of macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar cells on cytospin slides were recorded.\r\n Paraformaldehyde-fixed lung tissues were processed for paraffin embedding and sections of 5 mm thick were cut using a microtome, followed by staining with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathological examination. Sections stained with Masson's trichrome were analyzed for collagen deposition in the lung tissues. For immunohistochemical analysis, paraffin sections were dewaxed with xylene, and re-hydrated with graded ethanol before they were stained with antibodies against TGF-b1 (T1654 Sigma, St Louis, USA), MMP-9 (3309 Chemicon, Merck BioSciences, Darmstadt, Germany), and TIMP-1 (Ab-1 IM32 Calbiochem, Temecula, CA, USA) in the alveolar tissue.\r\n Frozen lung sections of 15 mm thick were cut by using a Thermo cryotome (Shandon, Southern Products Ltd.). After incubation with intracellular fluorescent probe dihydroethidium (40 mM) (DHE; Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA) and NADPH\r\n (1 mM) in a light-protected humidified chamber at 371 C for 30 min, the oxidative signal (ROS) was analyzed using a fluorescence microscope. Sections incubated with 40 mM DHE without NADPH served as the ''positive'' control.\r\n Frozen left lung tissues were rinsed briefly with phosphate buffer and total proteins obtained by extracting with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mg\/mL PMSF, 1 mg\/mL aprotinin, 1% triton and proteinase inhibitor cocktail). Protein array analysis was then performed using the Rat Antibody Array 1 (RayBiotech, Inc., GA, USA).\r\n Hydroxyproline was assessed as a measure of collagen deposited in the lung tissue (Reddy and Enwemeka, 1996) . Briefly, hydroxyproline in the lung tissue homogenate was oxidized in 1 M acetate buffer containing 1.4% chloramine T (857319, Sigma, USA), 1 M Ehrlich's reagent, and 1 M 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (D2004, Sigma, USA) at 65 1C for 15 min to develop chromophores. The optical density of the reaction product corresponding to the amount of collagen was measured at 550 nm using an ELISA microplate reader.\r\n Lung tissues were removed from the control and treated rats for total cellular RNA isolation using TRIzol reagents. One microgram of total RNA was directly reverse-transcribed at 42 1C for 50 min using a Superscript TM preamplification system (18089-011, GIBCO\/ BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA). Each RT product was subjected to semi-quantitative PCR using Thermoprime DNA polymerase and primers against TGF-b1, procollagen Ia, TIMP-1 and MMP-9 from GIBCO\/BRL (Grand Island, NY, USA) (Table S1, Supporting information) in a 9700 Perkin Elmer thermal cycler. The PCR products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel, and band intensity was measured by a Chemiluminescence Imaging Analysis System using FluorChem software (Alpha Innotech Corp. USA). The intensity of each band was normalized to that of the internal control, b-actin (Table S1 , Supporting information) (Liu et al., 2005) .\r\n For the quantitative analysis of fibrotic proteins (TIMP-1, TGF-b1 and MMP-9) in Experiment 2, a quantitative real time RT-PCR method with Taqman probes from Applied Biosystems (USA) was used (Table S2 , Supporting information).\r\n Human lung carcinoma epithelial A549 cells (ATCC CCL-185) were cultured in F-12K medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU\/mL penicillin, and 100 mg\/mL streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator at 37 1C. Cells were seeded in 6 cm culture dishes at 0.5 \u00c2 10 6 for analysis of EMT protein expression.\r\n Fibroblastic changes were induced in A549 cells by treatment with 5 ng\/mL of TGF-b1 for 48 h, and the EMT phenotype was assessed by co-treatment of these cells with (1) Cordyceps extract (8 mg\/mL), and (2) 80 mM cordycepin (Sigma C3394). For cell assay, Cordyceps powder was extracted with culture medium (8 mg\/mL) at room temperature, centrifuged for 10 min at 700 g and the supernatant was collected as Cordyceps extract (CE) for cell assays. Cell lysates were collected after treatment with CE and cordycepin for 48 h and subjected to immunoblotting using antibody against epithelial marker protein, E-cadherin (3194 Cell Signaling Technol, Danvers, MA, USA), and a mesenchymal marker, vimentin (MS129 Lab Vision, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fremont, CA). Band intensities were quantified by the software PD Quest (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and normalized by GAPDH (5174 Cell Signaling Technol.) (Liu et al., 2005) .\r\n Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Duncan's multiple range test to detect intra-group (inter-group for 2-way analysis) differences using GraphPad Prism sofeware 5.0. Significant difference was considered when po0.05.\r\n The lungs of untreated Sprague-Dawley rats showed normal alveolar pattern with broncheoli surrounded by alveolar sacs and alveoli separated by alveolar septa (Fig. 1a) . Pathological features in rat lungs of BLM-induced fibrosis with and without CS2 treatment are summarized in Table 1 .\r\n Significant increase (***p o0.01) of infiltrated inflammatory cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes (Table S3 , Supporting information), and presence of peribronchial and interstitial fibrosis in foci or regions was prominent in alveolar tissues of rats after treatment with BLM for 14 days (Fig. 1b) . In these lungs, an intense staining for collagen fibers was demonstrated by Masson's trichrome stain (Fig. 1e-h) , and about 3-fold increase (0.024 mg\/mg protein vs 0.008 mg\/mg protein for BLM and untreated sham control, respectively) was observed by hydroxyproline analysis for collagen fibers (Fig. 2) . However, the fibrogenic remodeling intensity was significantly reduced in rats treated with CS for 2 weeks, which was associated with decreased numbers of inflammatory cells (***p o0.01) (Table S3 , Supporting information) and fibroproliferative foci ( Fig. 1c and d; g and h) . The levels of collagen were reduced by 37.5% and 45% in CS1 and CS2 groups, respectively (Fig. 2) , indicating a dose-dependent attenuation of lung fibrosis in BLM-rats after CS treatment for two weeks.\r\n Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) and tissue remodeling regulators, e.g., metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs), are mediators for the development of BLM-mediated lung fibrosis (Liu et al., 2007) , an in situ detection of ROS (superoxide) and RT-PCR analysis of regulators at transcriptional levels was performed. A mild emission of red fluorescence from DHE, a superoxide anion-specific indicator, was found to be present in the lung tissue of untreated rats, but it increased intensively in the lung tissue of BLM-treated rats (Fig. S1 , Supporting information), indicating a strong ROS production in the fibrotic tissues (Fig. S1b, Supporting information) . The fluorescence returned to control levels in CS1 rats (Fig. S1c , Supporting information), and further to an invisible level in CS2 rats (Fig.  S1d, Supporting information) .\r\n MMP-9, TIMP-1, TGF-b1 and collagen are pro-fibrotic genes that were activated in lung fibrosis, and thus no MMP-9 and procollagen transcripts but only mild levels of TGF-b1 and TIMP-1 transcripts were found in normal lung tissues by RT-PCR analysis. All these fibrogenic genes were expressed dramatically in the lungs of BLM-treated rats, but they were suppressed by CS treatments in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. S2 , Supporting information). This finding was partially confirmed by protein array analysis; out of 16 cytokine proteins analyzed TIMP-1 protein in lung tissues from BLM-rats was significantly suppressed by CS2 treatment (Fig. S3 , Supporting information).\r\n Cordyceps treatment (CS1 and CS2 groups) for two weeks had attenuated BLM-induced lung fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner in Experiment 1 (Figs. 1 and 2) and thus the high-dose (CS2) was used in subsequent time-dependent experiments. In order to study the preventive\/prophylactic and the therapeutic effects of CS treatments, CS2 was given before, during and after lung fibrosis was developed (i.e., immediate, 1-week and 2-week after intragastric BLM injection, respectively). These rats received CS2 treatments for 28 day, 21 day and 14 day, respectively, and the lung tissues were subjected to morphological and biochemical analysis.\r\n Focal alveolar hemorrhage with hemosiderin deposition, and mild interstitial inflammation with macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes (Table S3 , Supporting information), as well as peribronchonchial fibrosis, were observed in the lung tissue of BLM-rats (Table 1) . Results shown in Fig. 3 further confirm an increase of lung hydroxyproline content in BLM-rats by 1.72 folds in comparison to the untreated sham controls, which was consistent with the findings in Experiment 1. The hydroxyproline production was significantly suppressed to the untreated control levels after CS treatments in a time-independent manner (Fig. 3) .\r\n To quantify the changes of fibrogenic genes after CS2 treatment at various time points, total RNAs were collected for measurement by quantitative real time RT-PCR. The results suggested a 6-fold increase of MMP-9 in lung tissues of BLM-rats, which was gradually reduced to about 2-folds after CS2 treatment. Similar suppression of fibrogenic gene expression, i.e., TGF-b1 and TIMP-1, was observed in lung tissues with all three time-course treatments (Fig. 4) , indicating no significant difference among different treatment times (14, 21 or 28 day), and before or after the development of fibrosis (28-day and 14day treatment groups, respectively).\r\n Alveolar epithelial A549 cells normally joined to one another at cell junctions to form a layer of cobblestone-like appearance (Fig. 5a) with a high expression of E-cadherin in cell culture, but they changed into spindle fibroblast-like phenotype in the presence of 5 ng\/mL of TGF-b1 for 48 h (Fig. 5b) . The E-cadherin protein decreased to undetectable level (100%-3% for untreated control and TGF-b1 groups, respectively) but the expression of vimentin increased dramatically, typical features of epithelialmesenchymal transition. In order to determine if EMT was inhibited by active ingredients of Cordyceps (e.g., cordycepin), A549 cells were co-treated with TGF-b1 and Cordyceps extract (CE, 8 mg\/ml) or 80 mM cordycepin for 48 h. The expression of vimentin and E-cadherin was found to reverse back to those in epithelial phenotype by cordycepin but not by CE (Fig. 5c) , implicating that TGF-b1-induced EMT had been inhibited. On the other hand, the low level of cordycepin in crude Cordyceps extract may be insufficient to reverse the EMT process.\r\n Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, irreversible and debilitating lung disease with fibroblast expansion and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix in the interstitium that causes breathing difficulty. There are more than 5 million people worldwide suffering from this disease, but all current treatments are not effective, and patients usually die from this lung disorder within 3 years of diagnosis (Antoniou et al., 2007) . C. sinensis (Dong-Chong-Xia-Cao) is a folk medicine in China to soothe the lung for the treatment of fatigue and respiratory diseases, as well as modulation of immune response, redox balance, inhibition of angiogenesis and the relief of liver fibrosis. Clinically a partial relief of lung fibrosis has been achieved in patients suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Hui and Chan, 2006) . As a continuous study on the protective\/therapeutic mechanisms of Cordyceps against lung fibrosis, we analyzed the morphological changes of lung tissues and the expression of fibrogenic factors in a rat model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in order to gain insight into the treatment of this hampering disease. Total RNA was isolated from lung tissues of untreated and BLM-treated rats, and reverse transcribed into cDNA for PCR using Taqman probes for MMP-9, TGFb-1 and TIMP-1 genes (n \u00bc6). Increase of fibrotic gene transcription, including TIMP-1, procollagen I, TGF-b1, and MMP-9, in lung tissues from BLM-treated rats, but the transcripts returned to normal levels after time-course CS2 treatments. Lung fibrosis is characterized by abnormal proliferation of alveolar mesenchymal cells, e.g. myofibroblasts, and activation of inflammatory cells, e.g. neutrophils and macrophages (Chaudhary et al., 2006; Dunkern et al., 2007) . All these cells under stress produce TGF-b1 which activates characteristic accumulation of matrix proteins, mainly type I collagen and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in IPF or in animal models of BLM-induced fibrosis (Cutroneo et al., 2007) . MMPs are a family of ECM degrading enzymes from inflammatory cells which play important roles in inflammation and tissue remodeling (Yoshimura et al., 2006) . MMP-9, a member of the MMP family commonly associated with IPF, binds non-covalently to its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), in a 1:1 M ratio. About 2-fold increase of TGF-b1 and TIMP-1, and 5.8-fold increase of MMP-9 were found in lung tissues of BLM-rats, making MMP-9\/TIMP-1 imbalance and accumulation of alveolar ECM commonly found in human fibrotic lungs (Kelly and Jarjour, 2003; Yoshimura et al., 2006) . An increase in MMP\/TIMP favors tissue injury, while the reverse may be associated with anti-fibrosis (Kelly and Jarjour, 2003) . The quantitative RT-PCR was only performed in Experiment 2, in which lung fibrosis is alleviated at a decrease of MMP-9\/ TIMP-1 in a time-independent manner as shown in all CS treatment groups. It is, however, noteworthy that MMP-9 transcription was suppressed to a greater extent than that of TIMP-1, resulting in a significant reduction of MMP-9\/TIMP-1 imbalance (from 5.8 to around 1.6-1.8 for all CS treatment groups), and thus attenuating the fibrotic injury of the BLM-rats in Experiment 2.\r\n Imbalance of MMP-9\/TIMP-1 was induced by oxidative stress (Yoshimura et al., 2006) , but alleviated by antioxidants, e.g., epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) (Sriram et al., 2008) and resveratrol (Sener et al., 2007) . Although antioxidative activity was demonstrated in Cordyceps, it is, however, unlikely the cause for its antifibrotic activity (Yu et al., 2006) because even N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a strong oxidant scavenger, can only slightly alleviate fibrogenesis when it is prescribed in association with corticosteroid for this incurable lung disease (Cottin and Cordier, 2008; Moeller et al., 2008) . In addition, cordycepin, the active ingredient isolated from Cordyceps, did not show significant antioxidative activity (Yu et al., 2006) , implicating current information about pharmacological activities of Cordyceps is insufficient to explain its underlying anti-fibrotic mechanism.\r\n Among the wide range of biomedical properties of Cordyceps, antifibrotic activities reported in animal fibrosis models of kidney (Zhao and Li, 1993) , liver (Zhang et al., 2004) , and lung (Wang et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2011) receive pharmaceutical attention because fibrosis is an irreversible and debilitating disease. In those studies, Cordyceps was given orally in either suspension or aqueous extract (Nan et al., 2001; Won and Park, 2005) , ranging from 0.3 g\/kg\/day for 9 weeks (Liu et al., 2003) to 0.66 g\/kg\/day for two weeks (Wang et al., 2007) . We have also demonstrated a partial relief of lung fibrosis in patients suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) following an oral administration of C. sinensis powder at 0.27 g\/day for 12 weeks (Hui and Chan, 2006) . C. sinensis is the authentic Dong Chong Xia Cao, but other species, e.g., C. militaris, and C. martialis are occasionally used as substitutes because of their similar biological activities (Li et al., 2006b) and lower market values. Interestingly, similar antifibrotic results, including decreased production of TGF-b1 and collagen, and restoration of MMP\/TIMP imbalance, were claimed in the treatment of liver or lung fibrosis with extracts from different Cordyceps species (i.e., C. sinensis or C. militaris) (Liu and Shen, 2003; Nan et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2007, Won and Park, 2005; Xu et al., 2011) . Some common bioactive ingredients across Cordyceps species may attribute to such activity.\r\n A dose-dependent antifibrotic activity of Cordyceps suspension was demonstrated in Experiment 1, in which Cordyceps was administered during the development of lung fibrosis. Similar conclusion was recently made by Xu et al. (2011) , who showed a decrease in TGF-b1 by cultured CS. The significance of the present study is perhaps the finding of alleviation of lung fibrosis after the fibrosis had developed (Experiment 2). The results of inhibition of critical fibrosis mediator (TGF-b1), reduction of leukocyte infiltration and collagen production, and the recovery from imbalance of tissue degradation and remodeling (MMP-9\/TIMP-1) do not show significant difference among groups of CS treatments for 14, 21 and 28 day. These results implicate both preventive and therapeutic potential of CS in the rat model of lung fibrosis induced by BLM (H\u00fcbner et al., 2008) . Further studies are required to identify active components in Cordyceps responsible for its antifibrogenic mechanisms.\r\n In addition over-expression of MMP\/TIMPs by fibrogenic cells, phenotypic alteration of cobblestone-shaped epithelial cells to more mobile myofibroblasts (i.e., EMT) and the formation of fibroblastic foci in IPF lungs are prominent features of experimental and human lung fibrosis (Antoniou et al., 2007) . These cells lose their cell-cell junctional protein, E-cadherin, and express mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA). EMT is thus critical to the development and progression of fibrosis, and its inhibition is considered a chemotherapeutic target for fibrosis. A preliminary study did show reverted EMT by cordycepin at 80 mM but not by crude Cordyceps extract in cultured A549 cells in the present study, probably attributed to relatively low level of cordycepin (40-60 mg\/g) and high cytotoxicity of other ingredients in the crude Cordyceps extract (unpublished data). A combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacological analysis of Cordyceps extract or its active ingredients (e.g., cordycepin, adenosine and others) in the prevention of EMT may provide an insight into the antifibrogenic properties of Cordyceps.\r\n There is increasing evidence for pro-fibrotic roles of growth factors [e.g. platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)] (Chaudhary et al., 2006; Moeller et al., 2008) , cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a) and interferon-gamma (IFN-g)) (Moeller et al., 2008) , and soluble IL-2R (Hui and Chan, 2006) . Scientific research in laboratories and clinical screening for therapeutic agents targeting these factors are extensively studied globally (Moeller et al., 2008) . It is interesting to find that CS not only down-regulates pro-fibrotic factors, such as TGF-b1 and MMP-9, in the present study, but also suppresses soluble IL-2R (Hui and Chan, 2006) , VEGF, inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a and IFN-g) (Li et al., 2006a) , and anti-apoptotic activity (Shahed et al., 2001) . Such a wide range of activities warrants further investigation for the potential development of CS as a therapeutic agent for lung fibrosis.\r\n Our animal results suggest that C. sinensis not only possesses preventive but also therapeutic potentials in the treatment of lung fibrosis, and that one of its active ingredient, cordycepin, can partially reverse TGF-b1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in A549 alveolar epithelial cells.\r\n for the donation of Cordyceps sinensis samples.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats of 8-12 weeks old were housed in normal laboratory conditions at 21721 C under a 12\/12 lightdark cycle. A dose of CS at 1.35 g\/kg was therefore used in the subsequent time course study in Experiment 2 (see Scheme 1). Among the four groups of BLM-treated rats, three groups received daily CS2 dose (1.35 g\/kg) starting from Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15, respectively, and they were all sacrificed on Day 28. One group of fibrotic rats received water to serve as positive lung fibrosis control. Alveolar cells were collected from right lungs of treated and untreated rats by bronchoalveolar lavage with physiological saline.

R. Br. (Apocynaceae), a wide used ethic-medicine in many Asia and Africa counties, has also been recorded as the common traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of illnesses in respiratory system by Dai people. Aim of the study: To provide experimental data of clinical adaption of total indole alkaloids (TA) from leaf of A. scholaris for treating post-infectious cough in phase II clinical trial. Materials and methods: To model post-infectious cough, all animals except control group were instilled intratracheal with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (80 \u03bcg\/50 \u00b5L\/mouse), followed by subsequent exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) for 30 min per day for a total of 30 days. Mice were orally given TA at dose of 10, 25, 50 mg\/kg, and four main alkaloids (Sch: scholaricine, Epi: 19-epischolaricine, Val: vallesamine, Pic: picrinine) once daily. Cellular infiltration was assessed in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the serum was determined, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the serum and homogenate were examined. Finally, histopathological examination in the lungs was assessed by H. E. staining. Results: After administration of TA and four major alkaloids respectively, the symptoms of cough in mice were obviously attenuated. Total white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils (NEU) amounts in BALF were reduced obviously and the pathological damage of lung was also attenuated. There was also significant reduction in IL-6, CRP, MDA and a marked improvement in SOD. Conclusions: The efficacy of indole alkaloids against post-infectious cough (PIC) was shown in the down-regulation of inflammatory cells, cytokines, and the balance of antioxidants. What's more, the pharmacological effects of TA were better than single indole alkaloid, which might be related to the synergic effect of four major alkaloids.","text_body":"Coughing is the classic symptoms of a cold, which has been divided into three types on the basis of its duration: acute cough (< 3 weeks), sub-acute cough (3-8 weeks), and chronic cough (> 8 weeks) (Irwin et al., 2006) . Post-infectious cough (PIC) belongs to a type of sub-acute cough, and the percentage of it is 40% \u2212 50%. Among the causes that can induce cough, the most common is represented by the infection of upper respiratory track, generally of viral origin. The most frequently implicated are picornavirus (rhinovirus and enterovirus) and coronavirus, followed by adenovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza and influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and bocavirus (Dicpinigaitis et al., 2009; Footitt and Johnston, 2009; Jones and Stewart, 2002; Pappas et al., 2008; Regamey et al., 2008) . Cough is the most common and troublesome symptom during airway infections, which is a major cause of significant morbidity an indeed mortality, and may last for several weeks or even months in some patients (Jones and Stewart, 2002) , that bring the patient to the doctor (Footitt and Johnston, 2009 ).\r\n The process of virus's replication in the airways includes the following parts: virus attachment to epithelial cells, cell membrane fusion and release of viral nucleocapsid and proteins into the cell cytoplasm (Jackson and Johnston, 2010) . Some mediators, come from airway epithelial cells, activate the immune response by promoting the recruitment and activation of leukocytes (neutrophils, mast cells, monocytes, lymphocytes and cells NK) which provide a more effective response to different infections. Furthermore these cells release cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and oxygen free radicals that aggravate the injury of the airway structures caused by the virus (Biagioli et al., 1998; Jackson and Johnston, 2010; Rossi and Colin, 2015) .\r\n The pathogenesis of the PIC is as follows: extensive disruption of epithelial integrity, widespread airway inflammation, bronchial hyper responsiveness, and cough hypersensitivity (Betz et al., 2001; Cho et al., 2003; Morice, 2010; Zimmerman et al., 2000) . Studies showed that the incidence of coughing after infection has an increased trend in recent years, which raised to the range from 25% to 50% during outbreaks of atypical pathogens' infections (Ryan et al., 2012) .\r\n Although, a little of the complex pathogenesis of cough has been revealed by humans until now, but it at best increased the treatment options available (Morice et al., 2015) . Many patients use over-thecounter drugs, for instance, cough suppressants and expectorants\/ mucolytics, which often lack a clinically proven efficacy or have some activity, but at the expense of unpleasant or intolerable side effects. Two classes of cough suppressants are available: those with central action (codeine, dextromethorphan, and cloperastine) and those acting peripherally (levodropropizine). The only expectorant capable of inhibiting the cough reflex is guaifenesin. Meanwhile common side effects from these drugs are nausea, dry mouth, insomnia, dizziness, constipation, anorexia, fatigue, sleepiness and so on. A large part of income was spent on the treatment of cough globally (Morice, 2008) . However, satisfactory results of all the medicine were not achieved due to the symptomatic treatment, side effects, and relapse after treatment. Additionally, montelukast, medicaments of a gleam for treating respiratory tract infection, was unresponsive to treatment for post-infectious cough . Therefore, an unmet need exists for the development of an effective therapeutic approach to prevent PIC.\r\n Alstonia scholaris is distributed in deciduous, evergreen forests and even in plains widely over the tropical regions of Africa and Asia (Li et al., 1995) . Its leaves have long been used in \"dai\" ethno-pharmacy for the treatment of whooping cough (post infectious cough), chronic bronchitis, asthma, and other respiratory tract infections in Yunnan Province, PR China (Compiling Group of Yunnan Traditional Chinese Medicine, 1977) . Phytochemical constituents of different parts of the plant were investigated intensively by our group (Cai et al., 2010 (Cai et al., , 2008a (Cai et al., , 2008b (Cai et al., , 2007 Chen et al., 2016; Du et al., 2007a Du et al., , 2007b Feng et al., 2009 Feng et al., , 2008 Liu et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2015a Qin et al., , 2015b Xu et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2015a Yang et al., , 2015b Yang et al., , 2014a Yang et al., , 2014b Zhang et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2005) . Meanwhile, the chemical profiling and metabolites of alkaloidal extract of A. scholaris were reported (Cao et al., 2015) , in which scholaricine, 19-epischolaricine, vallesamine, and picrinine were the major indole alkaloids of its leaf ( Fig. 1.) , and their pharmacokinetic behavior in rats was also investigated (Zhao et al., 2017) . Moreover, A. scholaris extracts and alkaloids have shown antitussive, anti-asthmatic, expectorant (Shang et al., 2010a) , analgesic, anti-inflammatory (Shang et al., 2010b) , anti-airway inflammation , and airways anti-allergic effect (Zhao et al., 2017) in vivo. The alkaloids also triggered \u03b2 2 adrenergic receptor (\u03b2 2 AR) activation (Hou et al., 2012a) and inhibited the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) (Hou et al., 2012b) bioactivities in vitro. Based on the pre-clinical studies, the total indole alkaloids from A. scholaris (TA) has been registered as investigational new botanical drug (No. 2011L01436) and was approved for phase I\/II clinical trials by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). A phase-I Single-center, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial has been completed, and the results support further phase-II clinical trials. The traditional use and our pharmacological evaluation assumed that the alkaloids from the leaf of A. scholaris might be used in treatment of respiratory diseases related to airway sub-acute inflammation. In this paper, we present the effect of alkaloids on the model of post-infectious cough.\r\n Leaves of A. scholaris were collected in June 2013 in Pu'er city of Yunnan Province, People's Republic of China, and identified by Dr. Xiao-Dong Luo, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences. A voucher specimen (Luo20130601) has been deposited in State Key Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Plant Resources in West China, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\r\n The dried and powdered leaves of A. scholaris (1 kg) were extracted with 90% EtOH under reflux conditions (3 h \u00d7 4) and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo to get the ethanolic extract. The ethanolic extract was dissolved in 0.3% aqueous HCl solution and filtered; the residue was recognized as non-alkaloid fraction. Then the acidic solution, adjusted to pH 9-10 with 10% aqueous ammonia, was extracted with EtOAc to give TA fraction (10 g). Picrinine (10%), vallesamine (6%), sholaricine (6%), and 19-epischolaricine (2%) were isolated ( Fig. 1 ) and kept in refrigerator in a previous phytochemical investigation from TA.\r\n Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Hong mei brand cigarettes were purchased from Hongta Tobacco Group Co., Ltd. ELISA reagent sets for IL-6 and CRP were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) determination kits were purchased from Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute of Nanjing (Jiangsu, China). All the other chemicals and solvents were of highest purity grade available.\r\n Special pathogen-free male ICR mice, weighing approximately 22-25 g, were purchased from Kunming Medical University (licence number SYXK 2011-0004). All the animals were housed at room temperature (20-25\u00b0C) and constant humidity (40-70%) under a 12 h light-dark cycle in SPF grade laboratory. Food and water were supplied ad libitum. Animals were acclimated for one week before treatment.\r\n Animal study was performed according to the international rules considering animal experiments and the internationally accepted ethical principles for laboratory animal use and care.\r\n The experiment was performed according to previously described method with some modifications (Zhu and Li, 2014) . To model postinfectious cough, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital. The trachea was intubated with a cannula (30 mm length and outer diameter 1.5 mm). Mice were placed in a supine position with the head elevated. With use of a micropipette and an intravenous catheter inserted through the intubated cannula, 50 \u00b5L of sterile saline containing 80 \u00b5g lipopolysaccharide and corresponding vehicle with 50 \u00b5L saline were instilled. On 8th day, all mice except control were placed in a smoke chamber and challenged with exposure to smoke of 5 cigarettes for 30 min\/day for a total of 30 days. On 39th day after intra-tracheal instillation, the mice were randomly divided into 10 groups and treated as follows: (1) Control group (did not receive any intervention); (2) Model group: .5% carboxymethylcellulose intragastrically (i.g.), 20 mL\/kg; (3) DXM: dexamethasone (i.g.), 1 mg\/ kg,; (4) TA-H: total indole alkaloids (i.g.), 50 mg\/kg; (5) TA-M: total indole alkaloids (i.g.), 25 mg\/kg; (6) TA-L: total indole alkaloids (i.g.), 10 mg\/kg; (7) Sch: scholaricine (i.g.), 3 mg\/kg; (8) Epi: 19-epischolaricine (i.g.), 1 mg\/kg; (9) Val: vallesamine (i.g.), 3 mg\/kg; (10) Pic: picrinine (i.g.), 5 mg\/kg. Each group contained ten mice. A schematic diagram of the treatment schedule is shown in Fig. 2 .\r\n On 46th day, animals were euthanized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg\/kg) after overnight food deprivation. Then blood samples were collected via the orbital vein of mice. The serum samples were obtained by centrifuging blood samples at 4\u00b0C, 4000 \u00d7g for 15 min, and serum samples were prepared and stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C for the analysis of IL-6, CRP (Neumann et al., 2013) , SOD, and MDA (Lemos et al., 2014) . Operation was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications.\r\n The right lungs were ligated and the left lungs were lavaged with 1.5 mL of autoclaved PBS for 3 times. The BALF was immediately centrifuged at 4\u00b0C, 300 g for 10 min. The cell pellets were re-suspended in PBS, and the total cell number was counted using blood counting instrument (Wang et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2009 ).\r\n Lung tissue supernatants were prepared as described previously (Tsai et al., 2014) . After BALF collection, 50 mg lungs were homogenized in 0.45 mL of ice-cold PBS, the assay mixture was cooled on ice, followed by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to obtain the supernatant, and stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C until required for SOD and MDA analysis.\r\n The right lung tissues were embedded in paraffin, cut into sections of 5 \u00b5m thickness, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H. E.) to evaluate the general morphology, as reported previously (Ichiki et al., 2005) . The degrees of peribronchial and perivascular inflammation were scored in a double-blind screen with two independent blind investigators using a subjective scale of 0-5 (0, normal lung; 1, structural lesions of bronchial mucosa and alveolar wall were mild; 2, focal lesions of the bronchial mucosa and alveolar wall structures; 3, lesions of bronchial mucosa and alveolar wall were patchy; 4, lesions of bronchial mucosa and alveolar wall were less than 1\/2 lobectomy; 5, lesions of bronchial mucosa and alveolar wall were more than 1\/2 lobectomy) as described elsewhere (El-Agamy, 2011; Li et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2012) .\r\n Results are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 10). Comparisons between 2 groups were made by using a 2-tailed Mann-Whitney test. Multiple comparisons were made by using 1-way ANOVA with the Turkey post-test or Kruskal Wallis analysis with the Dunn post-test, in which nonparametric analyses were appropriate. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered as significant for all the analyses.\r\n In contrast to control, the mice model developed cough, dyspnea, bristling, huddling, reducing diet, reduction, and weight loss. During administration period, the symptoms of the treatment groups alleviated without dose-response dependence compared to the model group.\r\n Lungs were lavaged at the end of experiment and differential cells in BALF were counted to investigate the effect of TA on inflammatory cells influx. As shown in Table 1 , number of WBC (p < 0.05 vs. control group) and neutrophils (p < 0.05 vs. control group) in BALF increased in mice model, they were 3.8 \u00b1 0.8 and 1.1 \u00b1 0.08, respectively, while the number of WBC in TA-L group and Epi group were 1.1 \u00b1 0.3 and 1.6 \u00b1 0.5 (both p < 0.05 vs. model group), respectively. The number of neutrophils in all the three TA groups as well as Pic group was 0.43 \u00b1 0.08, 0.54 \u00b1 0.08, 0.43 \u00b1 0.08, and 0.51 \u00b1 0.09 (all \r\n IL-6 and CRP production in serum were analyzed by ELISA. As shown in Table 2 , LPS instillation and CS significantly increased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and CRP in the serum as compared to model animals (both p < 0.05 vs. control group), these were 26.5 \u00b1 1.1 and 24.8 \u00b1 0.5, respectively. However, TA-L and Sch groups significantly reduced the level of IL-6-22.7 \u00b1 0.6 and 22.2 \u00b1 0.9, respectively, (both p < 0.05 vs. model group). The content of CRP was markedly decreased to 22.7 \u00b1 0.5 and 22.9 \u00b1 0.4 in TA-H and TA-L groups, respectively. DXM group showed similar effects on the above two parameters (all p < 0.05 vs. model group). The remaining treatment group had the trend of decrease, but there was no significant difference (p > 0.05 vs. model group).\r\n Oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of PIC. SOD and MDA activities in the serum and lung homogenate were determined to evaluate the effect of indole alkaloids on oxidative stress. As shown, model group resulted in marked decline of SOD activities in serum and homogenate (Table 3 ) compared with the control group (both p < 0.05) which decreased to 91.5% and 83.0%, respectively. Encouragingly, TA-M and TA-L groups significantly promoted the percentage of SOD activities, respectively, to 114.3% and 110% in serum (both p < 0.05 vs. control group), and to 120.3% (p < 0.01 vs. control group) and 118.3% (p < 0.05 vs. control group) in lung homogenate.\r\n Meanwhile, the percentage of MDA content in serum and homogenate (Table 4 ) was increased to 140.4% (p < 0.05 vs. control group) and 116.3% (p < 0.01 vs. control group) in model group, TA-L group also reduced MDA levels to 79.8% and 83.8% on the two samples (both p < 0.05 vs. model group). Val and Sch decreased the content of MDA significantly (p < 0.05\/0.01 vs. model group), while Pic and Epi showed improving tendency (p > 0.05 vs. model group) in the two indices compared to the model group.\r\n The production of inflammatory cells into the lungs of mice was also investigated by histopathological studies. LPS instillation and CS exposure provocated mice a marked infiltration of neutrophils around peribronchial and perivascular spaces compared to normal animals (Fig. 3) . Accordingly, the scores for total lung inflammation increased significantly (Table 5) . Besides, bronchia mucosal epithelium appeared swelling and shedding, and there was inflammatory cell infiltration exudate in the airway lumen. The infiltration of neutrophils in the bronchial mucosa was observed in control group. A few parts of infiltration of neutrophilic granulocytes were observed in pulmonary interstitial around the peribronchovascular. The results indicated that the infiltration of inflammatory cells reduced significantly in TA-treated mice compared to LPS and CS challenged mice, and four alkaloids (Sch, Epi, Val, and Pic) also prevented infiltration of inflammatory cells in Table 1 The production of total leukocytes in BALF after treatment.\r\n WBC (\u00d7 10 5 \/mL) NEU (\u00d7 10 5 \/mL) Note: Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM.

DXM at 1 mg\/kg treatment, used as the reference drug, improved the pulmonary histologic changes remarkably.\r\n The respiratory tract can be infected by a variety of bacteria, both gram positive and gram negative. The incidence of pneumonia is much higher for gram-negative infections than for gram-positive infections. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a large molecule consisting of a lipid and a polysaccharide, also known as lipoglycans and endotoxins, it was found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and stimulate strong immune responses in animals, which may cause PIC with an inflammatory response (Kitamura et al., 2001; Saluk-Juszczak and Wachowicz, 2005) . Several studies have shown that cigarette smoke has an impact on the immune function of the respiratory system, which induces the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemotactic factors, oxygen radicals and proteases (Joad et al., 2004; Karlsson et al., 1991) .\r\n In our present work, the content of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and CRP) and lipid peroxidation products increased significantly. Y.-L. Zhao et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 218 (2018) 69-75 Besides, pathological change in the lung showed that many inflammatory cells were accumulated and infiltrated. A successful animal model of PIC was established and used by intra-tracheal instillation of LPS and CS exposure in mice, since the etiologies and mechanisms of PIC have been extensively investigated in number of experimental models. Neutrophils are key blood cells, which play an important role in the pathogenesis of lung inflammation. A high number of neutrophils activate the reactive oxygen system and aggravate the development of respiratory diseases (Barnes, 2013; Cepkova and Matthay, 2006) . Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) has been extensively utilized for evaluating the alterations of lung microenvironment, including pulmonary epithelial integrity, cellular damage, and surface release\/accumulation of cellular secretory products. As expected, the animals exposed to LPS and CS exhibited a significant increase of neutrophils in BALF, and was consistent with histological examination of the lung tissue in our study. Then, after the treatment of indole alkaloids, the number of total cells and neutrophils in BALF were inhibited, meanwhile lung's inflammatory cell infiltration alleviated.\r\n Inflammation is controlled by various types of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines which are associated with the recruitment of inflammatory cell and tissue destruction (Liaudet et al., 2002) . Our research focused on the examination of interleukin (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). IL-6, an inflammatory and fibrogenic cytokine, is thought to play an important role in the development of lung disease (Jasiewicz et al., 2015) . Recent studies demonstrated that IL-6 is marked increased in CS exposed animals . CRP, an acute-phase protein, whose elevation accompanied by a remarkable pulmonary inflammation (Vos et al., 2009) . Clinical trials reported that serum CRP concentrations of patients with COPD were higher than healthy controls (de Torres et al., 2006; Gan et al., 2004) . In our investigation, mice intragastrically treated with indole alkaloids can effectively suppressed the elevated content of IL-6 and CRP produced by the exposure of LPS and CS in serum except the control group. The results suggest that the modulatory effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines may be one of the mechanisms of defending against infection.\r\n It has been reported that the cigarette smoke contains many oxidants and free radicals, which causes the injury of alveolar epithelial cells and reduce anti-oxidizing abilities, and further leads to a large number of protein denaturation and apoptosis of surrounding tissues, and induces airway inflammation (William et al., 1983) . SOD is an enzyme that exists in cells for removing oxyradicals, whose activity variation may represent the degree of tissue injury. Extracellular SOD might modulate neutrophil inflammation by reducing cytokine, released from macrophages, suggesting that extracellular SOD is an antiinflammatory enzyme as well as a major anti-oxidant (Mates, 2000) . Previous studies reported an increase of MDA concentration in the blood, BALF, and pulmonary tissues after the LPS administration (Shen et al., 2009) , which was also observed in our experiment. In current study, we analyzed the anti-oxidant parameters (SOD and MDA) of serum and lung tissues, and found that the SOD activities were rundown significantly in all LPS and CS treated groups, but remarkably recovered in animals treated with alkaloids. Meanwhile, the promoted MDA in LPS and CS treated animals could be reduced.\r\n Glucocorticoids with anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic activities are the most potent therapeutic agents, which are used to alleviate respiratory failure caused by neutrophilic granulocyte and alveolar macrophages in their metabolically activated states (Caramori and Adcock, 2003) . Then, dexamethasone (DXM) was selected as a positive control of alkaloids to treat PIC. The results indicated that indole alkaloids from the leaf of Alstonia scholaris could well treat PIC in mice, which roughly equals to DXM in general (p > 0.05 vs. DXM group).\r\n In conclusion, our study displayed that indole alkaloids could fight against PIC induced by LPS and CS exposure. However, the inhibition effect of TA was not appeared in a dosage dependent manner and superior to single alkaloids, simultaneously, four major alkaloids had different effects on different indicators, which assumed that the synergic effect between each component may compensate the drawback of single compound on PIC. And more importantly, this effect might be associated with the reduction of inflammatory infiltration and the improvement between oxidation and anti-oxidation.","sha":"3fb382f0bd23aaf5f7cf648705119b6f9ad69cfa","publish_time":"2018-05-23","authors":"Zhao, Yun-Li; Yang, Zi-Feng; Shang, Jian-Hua; Huang, Wan-Yi; Wang, Bei; Wei, Xin; Khan, Afsar; Yuan, Zhi-Wei; Liu, Ya-Ping; Wang, Yi-Fen; Wang, Xin-Hua; Luo, Xiao-Dong","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","doi":"10.1016\/j.jep.2018.02.040","Title":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","H index":170.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Coughing is the classic symptoms of a cold, which has been divided into three types on the basis of its duration: acute cough (< 3 weeks), sub-acute cough (3-8 weeks), and chronic cough (> 8 weeks) (Irwin et al., 2009; Footitt and Johnston, 2009; Jones and Stewart, 2002; Pappas et al., Cough is the most common and troublesome symptom during airway infections, which is a major cause of significant morbidity an indeed mortality, and may last for several weeks or even months in some patients (Jones and Stewart, 2002) , that bring the patient to the doctor (Footitt and Johnston, 2009 ).

The traditional use and our pharmacological evaluation assumed that the alkaloids from the leaf of A. scholaris might be used in treatment of respiratory diseases related to airway sub-acute inflammation. The dried and powdered leaves of A. scholaris (1 kg) were extracted with 90% EtOH under reflux conditions (3 h \u00d7 4) and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo to get the ethanolic extract.

The key mechanism of ALI\/ARDS is that the excessive inflammatory response damages the integrity of alveolar and bronchial cell membrane and thus affects their basic function. Phospholipids are the main component of cell membranes. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which catalyzes the cleavage of membrane phospholipids, is the most important inflammatory mediator of ALI. However, clara cell secretory protein 1 (CCSP1), an endogenous PLA2 inhibitor can increase the self-defense of membrane phospholipids. Thus, CCSP1 up-regulation and PLA2 inhibition constitutes an effective method for ensuring the stability of membrane phospholipids and for the treatment of ALI\/ARDS. In the present study, we developed an in vitro model of ALI via lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of a human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, and assessed the mRNA and protein levels of CCSP1 and PLA2 in the model cells. The results demonstrated LPS induction inhibited the transcription and protein expression of CCSP1, but only the protein level of membrane associated PLA2 was increased, suggesting that in the in vitro ALI model, abnormally regulated CCSP1 transcription plays a crucial role in the damage of cell membrane. To find out the reason that CCSP1 expression was decreased in the ALI model, we predicted, by means of bioinformatics, putative transcription factors which would bind to CCSP1 promoter, examined their background and expression, and found that a transcription factor, CCAAT\/enhancer binding protein \u03b2 (C\/EBP \u03b2), was correlated with the transcription of CCSP1 in the in vitro ALI model, and its phosphorylation in the model was decreased. CHIP-PCR and luciferase reporter assay revealed that C\/EBP \u03b2 bound to CCSP1 promoter and facilitated its transcription. Therefore, we conclude that there is a C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP1\/PLA2 pathway in the in vitro ALI model. The study of underlying mechanism show that the activity of C\/EBP \u03b2 depends on its phosphorylation:LPS stimulation reduced C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation and suppressed the transcription of CCSP1 in BEAS-2B cells, which resulted in enhanced PLA2 and the consequent membrane damage. And further study shows that overexpression of CDK2(Cyclindependent kinase 2), promoted the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 and inhibited PLA2 through the C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP1\/PLA2 pathway, so as to attenuate membrane damage. The significance of this study lies in that artificial C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation regulation may ease the membrane damage in ALI and improve membrane repair.\r\n Despite considerable advances in respiratory support and medications for ALI\/ARDS patients, the mortality rate is greater than 40% due to the absence of an effective treatment.

The integrity of the cellular membrane is essential for maintaining the vital activities of cells (Lucas et al., 2009) . The physiological function of damaged membranes can be recovered by repair, regeneration or reshaping. Phospholipids are the main component of cell membranes, and their degradation marks the start of cellular damage (De Luca et al., 2012; Elder et al., 2012) . PLA2, a phospholipase highly expressed on cellular membranes, catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 position of membrane glycerophospholipids to release lysolecithin, platelet activating factor (PAF) and arachidonic acid (AA), which process is a key link to induce lung injury (Kitsiouli et al., 2009; Shiyu et al., 2011) . CCSP is a major secretion of pulmonary clara cells, the nonciliated epithelial cells coving distal bronchiole (Jorens et al., 1995) . As an endogenous PLA2 inhibitor, CCSP1 has potent immune inhibition and anti-inflammation activity (Rastogi and McHowat, 2009 ) and can increase self-defense of the membrane phospholipids (Magrioti and Kokotos, 2010) . CCSP1 reduces the production of lysolecithin, blocks the abnormal deposition of integrins in fibroblasts, and inhibits the release of AA derivatives as inflammatory mediators, the chemotactic response of fibroblasts to PAF, and the production and action of multiple inflammatory mediators (Wong et al., 2009 ). In our initial study stage, we found that the mRNA and protein of CCSP1 were reduced in the in vitro ALI model, BEAS-2B cells exposed to LPS (Shiyu et al., 2011) . Up-regulation of CCSP1 can therefore stabilize membrane phospholipids and maintain normal cellular function in response to external factors, particularly endotoxin, by inhibiting PLA2 activity and thus preventing lung injury.\r\n C\/EBPs, a type of transcriptional regulation factor, were identified by Graves in 1987 (Zahnow, 2009 ). The C\/EBP family of transcriptional regulation factors includes at least six members: C\/EBP\u03b1, -\u03b2, -\u03b3, -\u03b4, -\u03b5 and -\u03b6. C\/EBP proves to be closely associated with ALI (Okuma et al., 2015) . Sugahara et al. demonstrated that C\/EBP promotes the proliferation of alveolar endothelial cells in ALI (Sugahara et al., 1999) . Therefore, we think that the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of LPS-induced cellular membrane damage in BEAS-2B cells. The major purposes of the study is to verify that (1) phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 increases the activity of the transcription factor;\r\n (2) C\/EBP \u03b2 can bind to the promoter of CCSP1 gene and positively regulates its transcription; (3) C\/EBP \u03b2 regulates the expression of PLA2 protein through CCSP1 transcription and thus affects LPS-induced membrane damage; i.e., there is a C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP1\/PLA2 pathway which regulates the cellular membrane damage in the ALI model.\r\n Department, Second Military Medical University of China) are human normal lung\/bronchial epithelia cells transformed by the SV40 T-antigen. BEAS-2B cells were cultured in LHC-8 medium (Invitrogen, CA, USA). Virus producing cell line 293 T (Systermbio, CA, USA) maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS were used for lentiviral packaging, in the luciferase reporter experiments, 293 T were used as a tool cell line. All these adherent cells were passaged by 0.25% trypsin digestion (Invitrogen) and incubated in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C.\r\n The CDS of human C\/EBP \u03b2 (NM_005194.3) was amplified using the primers 5\u2032-GCTCTAGAGCCACCATGCAACGCCTGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CGGGATCCCTAGCAGT GGCCGGAGGA-3\u2032, which contain an XbaI restriction site(5\u2032-TCTAGA-3\u2032) and Kozaksequence(5\u2032-CCACC-3\u2032) and a BamHI restriction site(5\u2032-GATCC-3\u2032), respectively, and cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA isolated from BEAS-2B cells. The PCR product was digested and cloned into the pcDH1-CMV expression vector (Systermbio); the recombinant vector was named pcDH1-C\/EBP \u03b2. The expression vector for human CDK2 (NM_001798.4) pcDH1-CDK2 and the expression vector for the CCSP1 gene (NM_003357.4) pcDH1-CCSP1 were similarly constructed using the primers 5\u2032-GCTCTAGAGCCACCATGGAGAACTTCCAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CGGGATCC TCAGAGTCGAAG ATGGGGTA-3\u2032 for CDK2 and 5\u2032-GCTCTAGAGCCACCATGGGAGCTGCTG GGA-3\u2032and 5\u2032-ATAAGAATG CGGCCGCTCACAACTTCTTCTTC-3\u2032 for CCSP1.\r\n An siRNA sequence targeting the CDS of C\/EBP \u03b2 was designed, and corresponding DNA hairpin structure (5\u2032-GATCCGAG CAAGGCCAAGAAGACCCTTCCTGTCAGAGGTCTTCTTGGCCTTGCTC TTTTTG-3\u2032) sequences were synthesized, annealed and cloned into the pshRNA-H1 expression vector (Systermbio); the resulting vector was named pshRNA-C\/EBP \u03b2. The shRNA expression vectors targeting CCSP1 and CDK2, pshRNA-CCSP1 and pshRNA-CDK2, which contained the sequences 5\u2032-GGAGCTTAACCATCCTAAT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGAGCTTAACCATCCTAAT-3\u2032, respectively, and the control vector pshRNA-NC (Negative Control), which contained the sequence 5\u2032-GTGACGAGCGAGTCAAGAT-3\u2032, were constructed in a similar manner.\r\n Next, we extracted human genomic DNA from BEAS-2B cells by QIAamp DNA Mini Kit(QIAGEN, Germany) and amplified the promoter of CCSP1 using the primers 5\u2032-GACTAGTAGGCCAGGTT AGGTGCTATGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GACTAGTGTGAGGGTGACAGCGA GTTTCAT-3\u2032, which each contain a SpeI restriction site(5\u2032-GACTAGT-3\u2032). The PCR product was digested and cloned into the pcDH1-CCSP1 expression vector to replace the CMV promoter; the recombinant vector was named pcDH1-wPro-CCSP1 (wPro means vector with wild type CCSP1 promoter). Bioinformatics analysis (TRANSFAC) revealed a potential C\/EBP \u03b2 binding site, 5\u2032-CTTGAGAAAA-3\u2032, in the CCSP1 promoter. We mutated the sequence to 5\u2032-CTTGCGGAAG-3\u2032 to generate a CCSP1 expression vector carrying a mutant promoter, pcDH1-mPro-CCSP1 (mPro means vector with wild mutant CCSP1 promoter).\r\n The promoters were amplified by using pcDH1-wPro-CCSP1 and pcDH1-mPro-CCSP1 plasmids as template, and cloned to a luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Enkancer (Promega, WI, USA), to construct the wild-type and mutant-type reporter vectors, pGL3-wPro-CCSP1 and pGL3-mPro-CCSP1. The PCR primers used are: forward, 5\u2032-GGGTACCAGGCCAGGTTAGGTGCTATGA-3\u2032 and backward, 5\u2032-CCAAGCTTGTGAGGGTGACAGCGAGTTTCAT-3\u2032, including KpnI (5\u2032-GGGTACC-3\u2032) and HidIII (5\u2032-CCCAAGCTT-3\u2032) digestion sites and protective bases.\r\n The sequence-validated recombinant vectors were amplified in bacteria, and endotoxin-free DNA was prepared by EndoFree Plasmid Mini Kit (Qiagen). The expression vector or shRNA vector and Lentivirus Package plasmids mix(Systermbio) were co-transfected into 293 T producer cells using Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen)as instructed by the manufacturer. After 48 h, the supernatants were collected, centrifuged and filtered using 0.45-\u03bcm polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, MI, USA). The viral titer was evaluated by gradient dilution. The packaged lentiviruses were named Lv-CDK2, Lv-C\/EBP \u03b2, Lv-CCSP1, Lv-wPro-CCSP1, Lv-mPro-CCSP1, Lv-shRNA-C\/ EBP \u03b2, Lv-shRNA-CCSP1, Lv-shRNA-CDK2 and Lv-NC.\r\n To examine the gene delivery efficiency and gene intervention effect of the recombinant viruses, we infected BEAS-2B cells with the overexpression and silencing viruses of CDK2, C\/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1. The cells were divided into five groups: BEASe2B, BEAS-2B + Lv-Control, BEAS-2B + Lv-CDK2, BEAS-2B + Lv-NC and BEAS-2B + Lv-shRNA-CDK2; the grouping for C\/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 gene intervention was similar. One day before viral infection, BEAS-2B cells in logarithmic phase were made into suspension by trypsin digestion, and the number of viable cells was counted by using trypan blue staining. Cells were collected by 1000 \u00d7 g centrifugation and re-suspended in LHC-8 medium to a concentration of 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells\/ml. Cells were seeded on 6-well plates, 2 ml\/well, and cultured overnight under normal conditions. One day after seeding, BEAS-2B cells were infected with lentiviruses diluted by LHC-8 at a MOI of 10, and the medium was refreshed after 24 h. The infection efficiency was assessed by fluorescence microscopy 72 h after infection. Total protein were extracted from the cells by a M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent Kit (Thermo, USA) and subjected to western blotting to measure the levels of CDK2, C\/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1.\r\n We developed an in vitro ALI model using LPS to induce BEAS-2B cells. Suspension of BEAS-2B cells in logarithmic phase was prepared by trypsin digestion, and the number of viable cells was counted with a hemocytometer by trypan blue staining. Cells were suspended in LHC-8 medium and seeded to 6-well plates at 2 \u00d7 10 5 \/well and cultured for 16 h and then the medium was replaced with the LHC-8 medium. 8 h after the medium replacement, LPS was added to a final concentration of 10 mg\/ml, and the cells were cultured for 12, 24 or 48 h more. Cells were collected and total protein was extracted and quantified by the method of BCA; intracellular inflammatory factors such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and 1 L-10, as well as PAF and AA, were measured by ELISA, which were used to determine whether the model was established. We then assessed the expression of CDK2, CCSP1 and PLA2, and phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 in the cells by western blotting.\r\n Since it is reported that overexpression of CDK2 can regulate the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 (Li et al., 2007) , we overexpressed and knocked down CDK2 via a lentiviral approach in BEAS-2B cells and examined the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2. At the same time, we predicted C\/EBP \u03b2 as a regulator of CCSP1 transcription, so we also overexpressed and silenced CCSP1 in BEAS-2B cells, and observed the effect on the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2. BEAS-2B cells in logarithmic phase were seeded to 6-well plates and recombinant viral solution was added at an MOI of 10. 72 h later, cells were collected and total protein was isolated and subjected to western blotting for measuring the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2. The cells were divided into five groups: cell control, the cells infected with Lv-NC, Lv-CDK2, Lv-shRNA-CDK2, Lv-CCSP1, or Lv-shRNA-CCSP1.\r\n According to bioinformatics, we found a possible binding site of C\/ EBP \u03b2 in CCSP1 promoter, 5\u2032-CTTGAGAAAA-3\u2032. We overexpressed Lv-wPro-CCSP1 or Lv-mPro-CCSP1 in BEAS-2B cells and then overexpressed or silenced CDK2 to find out the effects of overexpression and depletion of CDK2 and C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation on the mRNA level of CCSP1. By measuring CCSP1 transcription, we wanted to figure out the effect of C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation on CCSP1 transcription and whether C\/EBP \u03b2 binds to CCSP1 promoter through the predicted site. The cells were divided into nine groups: cell control, cells infected with Lv-wPro-\r\n , Lv-wPro-CCSP1 + Lv-shRNA-CDK2, and Lv-mPro-CCSP1 + Lv-shRNA-CDK2. The infection condition was the same as described above, and mRNA quantification was performed 72 h after infection.\r\n To verify the binding site of C\/EBP \u03b2 in CCSP1 promoter, we conducted CHIP-PCR experiment. BEAS-2B cells in logarithmic phase were infected with Lv-wPro-CCSP1 or Lv-mPro-CCSP1 and then infected with Lv-C\/EBP \u03b2. 72 h later, cells were harvested and subjected to CHIP-PCR in accordance with the instruction of EZ CHIP KIT (Millipore, MI,USA),The experiment were carried out with reference (Yang et al., 2013) and in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The primers for real-time quantitative PCR were: 5\u2032-TTGTGTGAGCTCAGTTTCAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCTTGGTGGGATAGGTAA-3\u2032, producing a product of 72 bp, carrying the predicted C\/EBP \u03b2 binding site \"5\u2032-CTTGAGAAAA-3\u2032\".\r\n To eliminate the interference of endogenous CCSP1 promoter on CHIP-PCR, we also performed luciferase reporter assays. 293 cells were transfected with pcDH1-C\/EBP \u03b2 and pGL3-wPro-CCSP1 or pGL3-mPro-CCSP1, and harvested for luciferase activity assay 48 h later. The transfection experiment was carried out in 24-well plates, following the instructions for Lipofectmaine2000. PGL-TK (100 ng) was transfected for each well as the internal reference for luciferase assay.\r\n To verify the specificity of the C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP1\/PLA2 pathway, we knocked down C\/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 respectively, and overexpressed CDK2 in the in vitro ALI model established by LPS induction to observe the effect on the inhibition of PLA2 by CDK2 and analyze the specificity of the pathway. The infection condition and LPS induction condition were the same as described above; 48 h after infection, LPS induction was carried out. 24 h after LPS treatment, cells were harvested and total protein was isolated for western blotting for measuring PLA2.\r\n 2.9. Examination of effect of C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation on damage of phospholipid membrane in in vitro ALI model\r\n The cells were treated as in the experiment for verifying pathway specificity: LPS induction started 48 h after infection, and 24 h after induction, cells were collected and subjected to PAF and AA assessment. The inter-group difference of PAF and AA releases was used to determine the damage degree of membrane phospholipid.\r\n After removal of the culture medium, the cells were washed with pre-cooled dPBS, supplemented with pre-cooled trizol reagent, and pipetted until the lysate became viscous and clear. The lysate was transferred to a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube and extracted using the phenolchloroform method (Han et al., 2002) . The purity of the total RNA was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry, and the mRNA levels of CCSP1 were detected by real-time PCR. Total RNA (2 \u03bcg) was used as the template to prepare cDNA by reverse transcription. The product of reverse transcription (2 \u03bcl) was used as the template for real-time PCR. The results were analyzed using the2 \u0394\u0394Ct method with \u03b2-actin (NM_001101.3) as the internal reference (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) . The PCR primers were as follows: \u03b2 actin-forward,5\u2032-CCTGTACGCCA-ACACAGTGC-3\u2032, \u03b2 actin-reverse,5\u2032-ATACTCCTGCTT GCTGATCC-3\u2032; C-CSP1-forward,5\u2032-GCCGGCGCCCGAGCTCTGGCTC-3\u2032;CCSP1-reverse, 5\u2032-TGTCAGTTTGTCAAATACCCCA-3.Each PCR reaction contained 10 \u03bcl of SYBR Premix Ex Taq, 0.2 \u03bcl each of forward and reverse primers (20 \u03bcM), 2 \u03bcl of cDNA, and dH 2 O to a final volume of 20 \u03bcl. The reaction parameters were 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 58\u00b0C for 10 s, and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 10 s. The experiment was carried out on Takara fluorescent quantitative TP800.\r\n Total protein was extracted, and proteins were detected by western blotting. Cells were rinsed with 1 ml of cooled dPBS, and 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mM pH 8.0 Tris, 1 mg\/ml leupeptin,150 mMNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mM EDTA, 100 mMphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 M dithiothreitol, and 1 mg\/ml aprotinin) was added for protein extraction. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Protein samples (10 \u03bcl\/lane) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes by wet transfer. Blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (TBST) containing 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 2 h and incubated with primary antibodies (anti-CDK2(sc-6248, santacruz),1:300;anti-CCSP1(07-623,millipore),1:500; anti-PLA2(sc-58,363,santacruz),1:500; anti-\u03b2 actin(sc-130,301,santacruz),1:800; anti-C\/EBP \u03b2(ab32358,Abcam),1:400;anti-phosphorylation-C\/EBP \u03b2(ab52194,Abcam),1:400) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The membranes were then rinsed with TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 h. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrates (Pierce, CA,USA) and Xray film were used to detect the bands, and the relative optical densities were analyzed using image processing software (Daniels et al., 2017) .\r\n Total protein was extracted and quantified using the BCA method, and intracellular TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 were measured using Human TNF\u03b1-ELISA kit, Human IL-1\u03b2-ELISA kit and Human IL-10 ELISA kit (Invitrogen).Experiments for the PAF and AA level were performed using the Human arachidonic acid (AA) ELISA Kit (MBS703581, Cayman) and Human Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) ELISA Kit (MBS701223) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the experiments, the value data of PAF and AA were calculated according to the A450.\r\n All data is expressed as mean \u00b1 SD, and analyzed by one way ANOVA. Least Significant Difference (LSD) was used for multiple comparisons between any two means. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 software.\r\n Highly efficient gene delivery is essential for effective interference. We resolved the difficulty of transfecting BEAS-2B cells by using routine approaches with a lentiviral system (Fig. 1A) , resulting in GFP expression in more than 90% of cells. The lentiviral approach produced good results for overexpression and knockdown of CDK2, C\/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 in BEAS-2B cells: western blotting results show that the expression levels of CDK2, C\/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 in the overexpression groups were 3.69 \u00b1 0.06, 4.18 \u00b1 0.04 and 3.06 \u00b1 0.07 times as high as that of the control groups respectively (Fig. 1B) , and CDK2, C\/ EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 in the knockdown groups were 0.12 \u00b1 0.01, 0.28 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.20 \u00b1 0.01 times as high as that of the control groups respectively (Fig. 1B) , with significant differences between the genetic intervention groups and the cell groups (P < 0.05); no significant differences were observed in CDK2, C\/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 expression levels between the Lv-NC or Lv-control groups and the control groups (P > 0.05). These data suggest that the lentiviral approach we used effectively expressed or knocked down CDK2, C\/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 genes, and the viral system and hairpin structure themselves had little effect on these genes.\r\n We employed LPS to induce BEAS-2B cells to develop an in vitro ALI model, and examined TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-10, as well as PAF and AA, in the cells to determine whether the model was established. ELISA results ( Fig. 2A) show that TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-10 were increased in BEAS-2B cells induced with LPS for 12 h, 24 h or 48 h, with significant difference in the three inflammatory factors between the LPS group and the cell group at 24 and 48 h (P < 0.05). Measurements of PAF and AA demonstrate that induction of 10 mg\/ml LPS for 12, 24, or 48 h increased PAF and AA, both of which peaked at 48 h. The inflammatory indicators and membrane metabolic indices suggested that BEAS-2B cells displayed an obvious inflammatory response after being induced by 10 mg\/ml LPS and released PAF and AA, indicating the successful establishment of the in-vitro ALI model. Based on the model, we assessed CDK2, CCSP1 and PLA2 levels and C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation in the cells (Fig. 2C) , and found the expression of CDK2 and CCSP1 and C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation displayed similar changes-a decrease after treatment of LPS, with significant differences between the LPS treated groups and the cell groups (P < 0.05); PLA2 was increased by LPS treatment, significant difference found at 24 and 48 h (P < 0.05). Analyzing the change of four proteins in different groups, we found that in the ALI model, CDK2, CCSP1 and phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 were decreased, with obvious correlation between each other. In addition, the expression of PLA2 was significantly increased in the ALI model, which was negatively correlated with the expression of CDK2 and CCSP1, and the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2.These findings hinted that the increase in the expression of CDK2, and CCSP1, and the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2, and the decrease in PLA2 may have a positive impact on ALI.\r\n Xi Le et al. reported that CDK2 can phosphorylate C\/EBP \u03b2 through Thr188 (Xi Li et al., 2007) , so in the study, we used CDK2 to regulate the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 by overexpressing and knocking down CDK2 in BEAS-2B cells. At the same time, we also overexpressed and depleted CCSP1 to observe the effect on C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation, which would help us to ascertain the relation between C\/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1. The results (Fig. 3) indicate that CDK2 overexpression increased both C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation and C-CSP1 expression (P < 0.05 vs cell control) while CDK2 knockdown suppressed both C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation and CCSP1 expression (P < 0.05 vs cell control). For C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation or CCSP1 expression, there was no significant difference between the Lv-NC group and the control group (P > 0.05). In addition, the overexpression and silencing of CCSP1 had no obvious effect on the expression of CDK2 or the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 (P > 0.05 vs cell control). Based on the analysis of these data, we speculated that CDK2 is an upstream mediator of C\/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 is a downstream element of C\/EBP \u03b2. The regulation of C\/EBP \u03b2 by CDK2 has been reported, but is it possible for C\/EBP \u03b2 to regulate the expression of C-CSP1? We next investigated the problem by using subsequent experiments.\r\n According to the prediction of bioinformatics, we constructed a recombinant lentivirus with the wild CCSP1 promoter, Lv-wPro-CCSP1, and a lentivirus carrying a mutant CCSP1 promoter, Lv-mPro-CCSP1. We infected BEAS-2B cells with these lentiviruses and overexpressed CDK2, and then qualified CCSP1 mRNA to verify the predicted binding site of C\/EBP \u03b2. The results (Fig. 4A) show that infection of Lv-wPro-CCSP1 or Lv-mPro-CCSP1 increased CCSP1 mRNA (P < 0.05 vs control). In comparison with infection of Lv-wPro-CCSP1 alone, co-infection with Lv-CDK2 increased CCSP1 mRNA, and co-infection with Lv-shRNA-CDK2 impaired the increase (P < 0.05). The co-infection with Lv-CDK2 or Lv-shRNA-CDK2 did not change CCSP1 mRNA in the cells infected with Lv-mPro-CCSP1 (P > 0.05). All these data suggest that C\/EBP \u03b2 regulates the transcription of CCSP1 through the predicted binding site. We further verified the binding by using CHIP-PCR (Fig. 4B ). In the BEAS-2B cells infected with Lv-wPro-CCSP1, C\/EBP \u03b2 bound to more DNA fragments around the binding site in CCSP1 promoter (P < 0.05 vs Lv-control), and in the cells infected with Lv-mPro-CCSP1, no difference was observed (P > 0.05). The luciferase activity assay data (Fig. 4C ) demonstrated that the luciferase activity in the groups transfected with pcDH1-C\/EBP \u03b2 alone or pshRNA-C\/EBP \u03b2 and pGL3-wPro-CCSP1 was significantly higher or lower than in the group transfected with pGL3-wPro-CCSP1 alone (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in luciferase activity between the group transfected with pcDH1-C\/EBP \u03b2, or pshRNA-C\/EBP \u03b2 and pGL3-mPro-CCSP1, and the group transfected with pGL3-mPro-CCSP1 alone (P > 0.05). No difference was observed in the groups transfected with pshRNA-NC with pGL3-wPro-CCSP1 or pGL3-mPro-CCSP1, compared with the groups transfected with pGL3-wPro-CCSP1 or pGL3-mPro-CCSP1 alone (P > 0.05).\r\n To verify the critical role of C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation in the C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP1\/PLA2 pathway and the specificity of the pathway, we overexpressed CDK2 in the in vitro ALI model to phosphorylate C\/EBP \u03b2 and then observed the change in PLA2; In addition, we also knocked down C\/EBP \u03b2 or CCSP1 in the ALI model with CDK2 overexpression and examined PLA2 protein levels in these groups. The results (Fig. 5A) show that CDK2 overexpression attenuated LPS-induced increase of PLA2 protein (P < 0.05 vs LPS group), indicating that overexpression of CDK2, or C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation, could significantly inhibit PLA2 expression in the in vitro ALI model. Knockdown of C\/EBP \u03b2 or CCSP1 impaired the inhibition of PLA2 expression by CDK2 overexpression (P < 0.05 vs LPS + Lv-CDK2), indicating in the in vitro ALI model, there was a specific C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP1\/PLA2 pathway. To illustrate the effect of C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation on membrane phospholipid damage in the in vitro ALI model, we treated BEAS-2B cells which overexpressed or were depleted with CDK2 with LPS for 48 h and assessed PAF and AA by ELISA. The data (Fig. 5B) show that CDK2 overexpression inhibited the release of PAF and AA induced by LPS (P < 0.05), while the contents of PAF and AA in the group of CDK silencing and LPS induction were slightly higher than that in the LPS group (P > 0.05). No change in PAF or AA was found in the Lv-NC group (P > 0.05 vs LPS group). In conclusion, we believe that the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 can promote the transcription of CCSP1 and subsequently inhibit the expression of PLA2 and then resist the disruption of phospholipids caused by ALI.\r\n C\/EBP family members have a basic DNA-binding domain and a leucine zipper domain, which bind to the enhancer 5\u2032-RTTGCGYAAY-3 (\u2032R = A or G, Y]C or T) or variants to positively or negatively regulate transcription, thus playing important roles in energy metabolism, cell growth, differentiation and tumorigenesis, hematogenesis and the immune response (Sayeed et al., 2015; Shimizu et al., 2015) . C\/EBP \u03b2 expression varies in porcine liver during prenatal and postnatal development and sharply increases after birth, according to Tang et al. (Tang et al., 2015) . C\/EBP \u03b2 can activate the transcription of the IGF1 gene by A. TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-10 in BEAS-2B cells were examined using ELISA 12 h, 24 h or 48 h after treatment of 10 mg\/ml LPS. The vertical coordinate indicates the concentration of target protein, and the horizontal coordinate indicates the experiment group. B. PAF and AA contents in BEAS-2B cells were measured using ELISA 12 h, 24 h or 48 h after treatment of 10 mg\/ml LPS. The vertical coordinate indicates the concentration of target protein, and the horizontal coordinate indicates the experiment group. C. CDK2, CCSP1 and PLA2 expression levels, as well as C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation, were assessed by western blotting 12 h, 24 h or 48 h after treatment of 10 mg\/ml LPS. Lower: image of target blots, upper: analysis on the optical density of three proteins, \u03b2 actin serving as the reference, and for the phosphorylated protein, the total protein of itself serving as the reference. Data are means \u00b1 SD from at least three separate replicates.*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01. vs cell group.\r\n binding to two sites of the IGF1 gene promoter. ATP-dependent P2X7 receptor activation is also dependent on the transcriptional regulation of C\/EBP \u03b2 (Bilodeau et al., 2015) . The above studies clearly indicate that C\/EBP \u03b2 mainly plays its transcriptional regulatory role as a nuclear transcription factor.\r\n Cassel et al. identified two binding sites for C\/EBP\u03b1 and C\/EBP\u03b4 in the sequence between \u2212 100 bp and \u221262 bp of the CCSP promoter through which C\/EBP\u03b4 and C\/EBP\u03b1 enhance CCSP expression via a complex response element in A549 cells which are adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (Cassel et al., 2000) . Massaad et al. (Massaad et al., 2000) suggested that IL-1\u03b2 can enhance the transcription of PLA2 through the promoter (\u2212 1614:+20 nt) by 6-7-fold, and the region (\u2212 210:\u2212176 nt) is crucial to the process. C\/EBP \u03b2 and C\/EBP\u03b4 can bind to this region, indicating that C\/EBP may block IL-1\u03b2induced PLA2 transcription. These studies may suggest that there are some potential relationships between C\/EBP and CCSP\/PLA2; however, the specific pathway remains unclear.\r\n The transcriptional activity of C\/EBP \u03b2 depends on its phosphorylation: phosphorylation of specific amino acids allows the protein to be translocated into the nucleus and bind to the promoter of genes regulated by it, so as to regulate the transcription of downstream genes (Zhou et al., 2015) .Therefore, our research objectives are to prevent the damage of membrane by effective intervention in the in vitro ALI model through the C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP1\/PLA2 pathway based on C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation. If C\/EBP \u03b2 inhibits PLA2 by upregulating CCSP1, we may seek an approach to repair membrane phospholipids damaged by acute inflammation based on the C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP1\/PLA2 pathway. Having confirmed the existence of the C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP\/PLA2 pathway, we attempted to suppress the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 to inhibit the pathway and reduce the LPS-induced breakdown of membrane phospholipids.\r\n Our data show that in an in vitro ALI model established by LPS induction, phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 was decreased and bioinformatics analysis discovered a putative binding site of C\/EBP \u03b2 in CCSP1 promoter, so we wondered whether C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation regulates the transcription of CCSP1. We, using CHIP-PCR and luciferase reporter assay, demonstrated that C\/EBP \u03b2 binds to CCSP1 promoter and positively regulates CCSP1 transcription, and its phosphorylation increases its transcriptional activity. Based on the validation of the specificity of C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP\/PLA2 pathway, we overexpressed CDK2 to enhance the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 on Thr188 (Li et al., 2007) , so as to inhibit the expression of PLA2 via the C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP\/PLA2 pathway, and to control LPS-induced cellular membrane injury. The findings corroborate that overexpression of CDK2 inhibited the production of PAF and AA in the ALI model, i.e., overexpression of CDK2 attenuated the damage of membrane phospholipids. The study sheds light on the underlying signal transduction for repair of membrane phospholipids and provides a novel target for treatment of ALI.\r\n We employed LPS to induce BEAS-2B cells, and found out the optimal condition for building the in vitro ALI model, 10 mg\/ml LPS induction for 24 h by examining TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 expression levels and the release of PAF and AA. Based on the model, we assessed CDK2, Fig. 3 . Overexpression and knockdown of CDK2 and CCSP1 and their effects on C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation.

CCSP1 and PLA2 protein levels, and the results revealed that in the model, CDK2 and CCSP1 were decreased, and PLA2 was increased. In addition, measurement of protein phosphorylation showed that LPS induction significantly suppressed C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation. To verify the existence of C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP1\/PLA2 pathway, we analyzed the relation between C\/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 gene. The experiment revealed that C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation or dephosphorylation could enhance or suppress CCSP1 transcription but overexpression or knockdown of CCSP1 had no effect on C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation, hinting at CCSP1 being downstream C\/EBP \u03b2. We next employed co-infection and CHIP-PCR to verify the binding site of C\/EBP \u03b2 in CCSP1 promoter predicted by bioinformatics. Quantitative determination of CCSP1 mRNA shows that C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation enhanced CCSP1 transcription controlled by the wild promoter but not that controlled by the promoter with binding site mutation, and dephosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 only inhibited CCSP1 transcription controlled by the wild promoter. CHIP-PCR results show that C\/EBP \u03b2 was capable of binding to the promoter DNA carrying the wild binding site but not the one carrying mutant binding site. However, though endogenous CCSP1 promoter is at a low level in CHIP-PCR experiments, it may have a certain inference on the experimental data. Therefore, we employed the luciferase reporter assay to verify the results of CHIP-PCR. The results indicated that overexpression of C\/EBP \u03b2 significantly increased the luciferase controlled by wild type CCSP1 promoter, but had no obvious effect on that controlled by the CCSP1 promoter with a mutant binding site. Eliminating the background impact, these data demonstrated that the transcription factor can bind to CCSP1 promoter through the predicted site and activate the transcription.\r\n These results clarified the regulatory sequence of the proteins in the C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP1\/PLA2 pathway. In addition, we also investigated the specificity of the C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP1\/PLA2 pathway by knocking down C\/ EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1, and the results indicate that the inhibition of PLA2 by CDK2 was mediated by C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation and transcription of CCSP1. LPS stimulation inhibits the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 in BEAS-2B cells, suppresses the C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP1\/PLA2 pathway, and increases the expression of PLA2 protein, leading to membrane injury. Since CCSP1 is an endogenous inhibitor of PLA2, we tried to inhibit the damage of membrane in the in vitro ALI model through regulating PLA2 via C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation. To regulate phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2, we overexpressed or silenced its upstream kinase CDK2, which is proved to be an effective means to phosphorylate or dephosphorylate C\/EBP \u03b2 by the experimental data. The findings suggest that overexpression of CDK2 suppressed LPS-induced increase of PLA2 in the cells via the C\/EBP \u03b2\/CCSP1\/PLA2 pathway, and inhibited the release of PAF and AA, a clear inhibition of membrane phospholipid damage in the in vitro ALI model. These findings are promising, since it is of significance to the treatment of ALI that increase of C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation could inhibit PLA2 expression and membrane injury in ALI. The results indicate that C\/EBP \u03b2 is a potential target for ALI treatment. However, we also have some urgent work for the future. For example, what is the mechanism by which LPS stimulation inhibits the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2, and is there some approach that regulates the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 in a more effective, more direct and specific way? The experimental strategy of increasing C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation by CDK2 overexpression is obviously not suitable for clinical application. For this reason, our future research will focus on the development of specific agonist for C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation, which may be used in the ALI treatment.\r\n In conclusion, our study shows that C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation could impair the increase in PLA2 in the in vitro ALI model through the C\/ EBP \u03b2\/CCSP1\/PLA2 pathway and thus restrain the membrane injury caused by PLA2, which is of significance to maintaining normal function of epithelial cells in ALI disease. It is also suggested that C\/EBP \u03b2 be a potential target for targeted therapy of ALI and the development of Fig. 5 . Verifying the specificity of the pathway and examining membrane damage A.

The CDS of human C\/EBP \u03b2 (NM_005194.3) was amplified using the primers 5\u2032-GCTCTAGAGCCACCATGCAACGCCTGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CGGGATCCCTAGCAGT GGCCGGAGGA-3\u2032, which contain an XbaI restriction site(5\u2032-TCTAGA-3\u2032) and Kozaksequence(5\u2032-CCACC-3\u2032) and a BamHI restriction site(5\u2032-GATCC-3\u2032), respectively, and cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA isolated from BEAS-2B cells. The viral titer was evaluated by gradient dilution.

One day after seeding, BEAS-2B cells were infected with lentiviruses diluted by LHC-8 at a MOI of 10, and the medium was refreshed after 24 h. The infection efficiency was assessed by fluorescence microscopy 72 h after infection. We developed an in vitro ALI model using LPS to induce BEAS-2B cells. Cells were collected and total protein was extracted and quantified by the method of BCA; intracellular inflammatory factors such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and 1 L-10, as well as PAF and AA, were measured by ELISA, which were used to determine whether the model was established. Since it is reported that overexpression of CDK2 can regulate the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2 (Li et al., 72 h later, cells were collected and total protein was isolated and subjected to western blotting for measuring the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2. 72 h later, cells were harvested and subjected to CHIP-PCR in accordance with the instruction of EZ CHIP KIT (Millipore, MI,USA),The experiment were carried out with reference (Yang et al., The product of reverse transcription (2 \u03bcl) was used as the template for real-time PCR. The PCR primers were as follows: \u03b2 actin-forward,5\u2032-CCTGTACGCCA-ACACAGTGC-3\u2032, \u03b2 actin-reverse,5\u2032-ATACTCCTGCTT GCTGATCC-3\u2032; C-CSP1-forward,5\u2032-GCCGGCGCCCGAGCTCTGGCTC-3\u2032;CCSP1-reverse, 5\u2032-TGTCAGTTTGTCAAATACCCCA-3.Each PCR reaction contained 10 \u03bcl of SYBR Premix Ex Taq, 0.2 \u03bcl each of forward and reverse primers (20 \u03bcM), 2 \u03bcl of cDNA, and dH 2 O to a final volume of 20 \u03bcl.

The experiment was carried out on Takara fluorescent quantitative TP800. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Protein samples (10 \u03bcl\/lane) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes by wet transfer. Blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (TBST) containing 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 2 h and incubated with primary antibodies (anti-CDK2(sc-6248, santacruz),1:300;anti-CCSP1(07-623,millipore),1:500; anti-PLA2(sc-58,363,santacruz),1:500; anti-\u03b2 actin(sc-130,301,santacruz),1:800; anti-C\/EBP \u03b2(ab32358,Abcam),1:400;anti-phosphorylation-C\/EBP \u03b2(ab52194,Abcam),1:400) at 4\u00b0C overnight.

In addition, the expression of PLA2 was significantly increased in the ALI model, which was negatively correlated with the expression of CDK2 and CCSP1, and the phosphorylation of C\/EBP \u03b2. We next investigated the problem by using subsequent experiments. According to the prediction of bioinformatics, we constructed a recombinant lentivirus with the wild CCSP1 promoter, Lv-wPro-CCSP1, and a lentivirus carrying a mutant CCSP1 promoter, Lv-mPro-CCSP1. We infected BEAS-2B cells with these lentiviruses and overexpressed CDK2, and then qualified CCSP1 mRNA to verify the predicted binding site of C\/EBP \u03b2. The co-infection with Lv-CDK2 or Lv-shRNA-CDK2 did not change CCSP1 mRNA in the cells infected with Lv-mPro-CCSP1 (P > 0.05). We further verified the binding by using CHIP-PCR (Fig. 4C ) demonstrated that the luciferase activity in the groups transfected with pcDH1-C\/EBP \u03b2 alone or pshRNA-C\/EBP \u03b2 and pGL3-wPro-CCSP1 was significantly higher or lower than in the group transfected with pGL3-wPro-CCSP1 alone (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in luciferase activity between the group transfected with pcDH1-C\/EBP \u03b2, or pshRNA-C\/EBP \u03b2 and pGL3-mPro-CCSP1, and the group transfected with pGL3-mPro-CCSP1 alone (P > 0.05). To illustrate the effect of C\/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation on membrane phospholipid damage in the in vitro ALI model, we treated BEAS-2B cells which overexpressed or were depleted with CDK2 with LPS for 48 h and assessed PAF and AA by ELISA. The vertical coordinate indicates the concentration of target protein, and the horizontal coordinate indicates the experiment group. C.

Commercial vaccines against this virus needs improvement of efficacy, especially in calves with BRSV-specific maternally derived antibodies (MDA). We previously reported that an experimental BRSV-ISCOM vaccine, but not a commercial vaccine, induced strong clinical and virological protection in calves with MDA, immunized at 7-15 weeks of age. The aim of the present study was to characterize the immune responses, as well as to investigate the efficacy and safety in younger animals, representing the target population for vaccination. Four groups of five 3-8 week old calves with variable levels of BRSV-specific MDA were immunized s.c. twice at a 3 weeks interval with (i) BRSV immunostimulating complexes (BRSV-ISCOMs), (ii) BRSV-protein, (iii) adjuvant, or (iv) PBS. All calves were challenged with virulent BRSV by aerosol 2 weeks later and euthanized on day 6 after infection. The cellular and humoral responses were monitored as well as the clinical signs, the viral excretion and the pathology following challenge. Despite presence of MDA at the time of the immunization, only a minimum of clinical signs were observed in the BRSV-ISCOM group after challenge. In contrast, in all control groups, clinical signs of disease were observed in most of the animals (respiratory rates up to 76 min \u22121 and rectal temperatures up to 41 \u2022 C). The clinical protection was associated to a highly significant reduction of virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of calves, rapid systemic and local antibody responses and T helper cell responses dominated by IFN\u2425 production. Animals that did not shed virus detectable by PCR or cell culture following challenge possessed particularly high levels of pulmonary IgA. The protective immunological responses to BRSV proteins and the ability to overcome the inhibiting effect of MDA were dependent on ISCOM borne antigen presentation.","text_body":"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), a member of the pneumovirus genus in the Paramyxoviridae family, is a major pathogen in the respiratory disease complex of cattle [1] [2] [3] . This virus is cytopathogenic and directly damages the respiratory epithelium in vivo, but also induces host responses that contribute to the development of disease [4, 5] . Synergistically acting co-or super-infections with other respiratory pathogens are common [6] [7] [8] ; however, the clinical signs may be severe by infection with BRSV alone [9] . The disease pattern of BRSV in a cattle population varies according to the level of virus circulation and subsequently eosinophils in the lung, which was also previously observed in children vaccinated against human (H)RSV in the 1960s, with a fatal outcome in two infants [17] . As a consequence of that tragedy, and although HRSV is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory infection in children and a frequent cause of death in developing countries [18] , there is still no effective HRSV vaccine available.\r\n Indeed, new vaccines on the bovine or human market must be safe, but should also ideally be designed to induce powerful protective immunity and, in order to have an impact on virus transmission, should completely prevent virus replication upon infection. A major problem to achieve this goal is that maternally derived antibodies suppress active responses to immunization, even at moderate antibody levels that are not per se protecting the young individual against RSV disease [10] and during the age when infections are common. Vaccination in cattle should preferably be performed at a young age; before commingling of calves into large units where BRSV often circulates, at a time when maternal antibody levels differ between calves [19] . To be efficient at the level of a population it is critical that a new vaccine is effective in the face of maternal immunity.\r\n Nasal administration of a live attenuated vaccine has recently been commercialized and is partially protective in this target group of animals [20, 21] . However, this vaccine virus is shed for long periods [22] , conferring a risk for passage to sentinel calves, which could potentially increase its virulence. On the other hand, inactivated conventional BRSV vaccines have showed varying efficacy in young calves against BRSV in the field [13, 16] . Furthermore, these vaccines are rarely evaluated in models that fully reproduce clinical signs of BRSV disease in the presence of maternal antibodies, and seldom with molecular diagnostic tools. Nevertheless, reduction of virus shedding has been demonstrated following one or two immunizations and challenge with BRSV inducing mild disease [23] [24] [25] [26] .\r\n In previous studies, we used a virulent BRSV model and PCR to compare the efficacy of a conventional inactivated vaccine with an experimental vaccine in 7-15 weeks old calves with maternal antibodies, with exceptional results: the conventional vaccine very poorly protected calves with maternal antibodies, whereas the experimental vaccine, BRSV immunostimulating complexes (BRSV-ISCOMs), conferred strong clinical as well as nearly complete viral protection against a heterologous BRSV strain [27] . The aim of the present study is to characterize in more detail the protective immune responses induced by BRSV-ISCOMs in young animals with maternal antibodies against BRSV, as well as to investigate the efficacy and safety in animals representing the target population for vaccination. On this occasion, the vaccine and challenge virus were homologous, and the time between vaccination and challenge was kept short to approximate the situation of BRSV infection after commingling of young calves. A group of calves immunized with BRSV proteins without adjuvant, qualitatively and quantitatively comparable to those in ISCOMs, was included to further elucidate the adjuvant effect of ISCOM in bovidae.\r\n Foetal bovine turbinate (FBT) cells and vero cells were propagated at low passages in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Lonza, Belgium), supplemented per litre with 20 ml 1 M Hepes buffer, 10 ml 200 mM l-glutamine and 10 ml 0.9% NaCl solution containing 60 mg benzyl penicillin sodium and 100 mg streptomycin sulfate salt, as well as foetal calf serum (FCS, PAA Laboratories GmbH, Austria) to a final concentration of 5%, 10% or 20% (DMEM + 5-20%). The cells were tested free from bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), by immunoperoxidase staining using polyclonal antisera (PA0042, VLA, UK).\r\n A BRSV isolate (no. 9402022, Denmark) was propagated in vero cells for production of ISCOMs. The seventh passage of the same BRSV isolate, propagated in FBT cells, was used for the experimental challenge, as described earlier [27] . Aliquots of the inoculum were titrated before as well as after the challenge of calves and the titers were determined to be 10 4.5 and 10 3.75 TCID 50 ml \u22121 , respectively. No contaminating mycoplasma could be detected in the virus, as determined by negative culture within the routine diagnostic of the National Veterinary Institute, Sweden (1553 ISO\/IEC 17025). The virus was also free from contaminating BVDV, bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV-3), as determined by seronegativity (BVDV and BCoV) or declining antibodies (PIV-3) detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) following two BRSV-ISCOM vaccinations of calves and BRSV challenge. Furthermore, five BALB\/c mice remained seronegative to BVDV, BCoV and PIV-3, but not BRSV following two vaccinations with a 5-week interval (data not shown).\r\n Stock solutions for ISCOM formulation were prepared by dissolving cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine (Sigma, USA) to a concentration of 15 mg\/ml each, in distilled water containing 20% (w\/w) MEGA-10 (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland). Quillaja saponin (QPUF300, Dessert King, Chile) was dissolved in distilled water to a concentration of 100 mg\/ml. The stock solutions, kindly provided by Isconova AB (Uppsala, Sweden), were filtered through a 0.2 m filter, aliquoted and kept at \u221220 \u2022 C until used. BRSV-ISCOMs were prepared from these stocks and from purified, solubilized BRSV. Briefly, sucrose gradient purified BRSV at 2 mg protein\/ml was solubilized with 2% (w\/v) n-octylglucoside (OG) in PBS (Boehringer Mannheim, GmbH, FRG), for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C with agitation. The solubilized virus was applied onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient with 0.5 ml 20% sucrose containing 0.5% OG, over 2.5 ml 50% sucrose. After centrifugation at 160,000 \u00d7 g (SW55 rotor, Beckman Coulter) for 45 min at 4 \u2022 C, the sample volume and the 20% sucrose layer containing viral proteins were collected, and cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine as well as Quillaja saponin were added in proportions of protein:cholesterol:phosphatidycholine:Quillaja saponin = 1:1:1:13, calculated by weight. After 2 h incubation at room temperature, dialysis was performed against 0.15 M ammonium acetate for 72 h at 4 \u2022 C, the ISCOMs were purified by centrifugation through 10% sucrose at 240,000 \u00d7 g (SW41 rotor, Beckman Coulter) for 21 h at 10 \u2022 C, and sterile filtrated. The BRSV protein controls were produced according to the same protocol, excluding the addition of cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine and Quillaja saponin before dialysis. The adjuvant control, AbISCO-300 \u00ae (provided by Isconova AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was made of the same batches of cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine and Quillaja saponin as used in the BRSV-ISCOMs (Dr K. L\u00f6vgren Bengtsson, personal communication).\r\n Twenty conventionally-reared calves of Swedish red and white breed and Swedish Holstein breed (13 male, 7 female, aged 2-7 weeks) were obtained from a closed dairy herd, certified as free from BVDV and bovine leucosis. Natural BRSV infections before experimental BRSV challenge were ruled out by regular monitoring of the calves as well as five seronegative 5-6-month-old sentinel animals in the herd for BRSV-specific serum antibodies by ELISA. After arrival at the Department of Clinical Sciences, Swedish University of Agriculture, Uppsala, all calves were treated with 15 mg toltrazuril\/kg once per oral route as well as 20 mg\/kg procain benzylpenicillin intramuscularly, once daily for five days, to minimize the effect of concurrent infections. The calves were matched into four groups according to age and BRSV-specific serum IgG levels; they were housed in four pens and were fed milk replacer as well as calf pellets twice daily, in addition to hay and water ad libitum. All calves were left unweaned throughout the study. The experiment was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Uppsala, Sweden (Ref. no. C68\/10). At the age of 3-8 weeks, the calves were immunized subcutaneously (s.c.) with either (i) BRSV-ISCOMs (containing 188 g total protein and diluted in 2 ml PBS, n = 5); (ii) BRSV-protein (188 g total protein diluted in 2 ml PBS, n = 5); (iii) 390 g AbISCO-300 \u00ae diluted in 2 ml PBS (hereafter called adjuvant, n = 5); or (iv) 2 ml PBS (n = 5), twice with an interval of 3 weeks. The mean age at first vaccination was 47, 48, 47, and 46 days in the BRSV-ISCOM, BRSV protein, adjuvant and PBS groups, respectively.\r\n Two weeks after the second vaccination, all calves were challenged with 3 ml of BRSV by aerosol inhalation (Super Dandy Inhailerboy, SveVet Piab, Sweden). The challenge procedure was carried out as described by Tjornehoj et al. [9] , with the exception that intra-tracheal injections were not included. The order in which the groups of calves were challenged was as follows: BRSV-ISCOMs, BRSV protein, adjuvant and PBS.\r\n A veterinarian observed the calves for general and local adverse clinical reactions on a daily basis after immunizations and performed daily clinical examinations of the calves from post infection day (PID) \u22121 through PID 6. Prior to all procedures on PID \u22121 and PID 6, each calf's pulmonary function was measured by the forced oscillation technique at 3, 5, 7 and 10 Hz (EEMS Hants UK; Pringle et al., in preparation [28] ). The clinical signs of disease were scored as presented in Table 1 (modified after West et al. [29] ). Nasal swabs (Virocult \u00ae , MedicalWire and Equipment Co. Ltd., UK) were obtained on indicated days ( Table 2 ) and stored at \u221270 \u2022 C until analysed for BRSV-RNA by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). Nasal secretions were obtained using tampons left in one nostril for 5 min (o.b. ProComfort TM , mini, Sweden) on PID \u22121 and PID 5. Upon addition of 3 ml PBS to each tampon and recovery of fluids by a syringe, samples were stored at \u221270 \u2022 C until analysed by ELISA for antibody. Serum was obtained from blood collected on selected days throughout the experiment, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), used for lymphoproliferation and cytokine assays, were extracted from heparinized blood collected on PID \u22123 or \u22122 as well as PID 4 or 5 (two or three calves per group and day before and after challenge), as described previously [30] .\r\n On PID 6, all animals were euthanized under general anesthesia overdose (5 mg\/kg ketamine followed by 15 mg\/kg pentobarbital sodium and exsanguination) and lungs were excised. Visible macroscopic lesions were photographed and together with palpable lesions were recorded on a standard lung diagram. These lung diagrams were scanned and converted to monochromatic representations of normal and lesioned lung tissue (Adobe Photoshop for Mac) and, using a completely filled in lung diagram for reference, a lesion percentage was calculated by digital counting of colored and uncolored pixels (unpublished software, Borland Delphi 7 source code can be requested from the author). A broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed post mortem, and prepared as previously described [31] . BAL cells and supernatants were stored at \u221270 \u2022 C until processed for virus isolation, RT-qPCR and antibody analysis, respectively. Tissue samples from three sites of each of the three lobes of the right lung and one site of the accessory lobe were fixed in 4% neutral-buffered formalin. Areas of pneumonic consolidation if present were always chosen for sampling. Moreover, an additional such sample was homogenized in DMEM + 20% and stored at \u221270 \u2022 C prior to virus isolation attempt.\r\n BRSV RNA was analysed by RT-qPCR detecting the BRSV F gene, according to the certifications SS-EN ISO 9001:2008 and SS-EN ISO 14001:2004, within the routine diagnostic of the National Veterinary Institute, Sweden. Briefly, RNA was extracted from 90 l nasal swab medium, using an extraction robot (Magnatrix TM 8000plus and Vet Viral NA kit, Nordiag, Sweden). The RNA was dissolved in 75 l RNase-free water and qPCR including reverse transcription of 2 l RNA was carried out in Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR, using AgPath-ID TM One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems, Sweden), with previously published primers and probe [32] . An RNA dilution series from an extracted cell culture containing 100,000 TCID 50 BRSV ml \u22121 was included as standard in each PCR run. The BRSV standard samples (n = 5, 10-fold dilutions) were each assigned a value correlating to TCID 50 in accordance with their dilution, and the starting quantities of the unknown samples were expressed as units correlating to TCID 50 , according to the standard curve.\r\n Virus isolations were attempted from homogenized lung tissue and BAL cells inoculated onto confluent FBT cells in 25 cm 2 tissue culture flasks, as described earlier, but without previous sterile filtration [27] . Daily examinations of the cell cultures for visible cytopathic effect were made in a blind manner during six days of incubation and negative samples were passed a second time in a new set of 25 cm 2 tissue culture flasks.\r\n IgG antibodies to BRSV in sera, nasal secretions and BAL as well as BVDV, BCoV and PIV3-specific IgG in sera were analysed using commercial indirect ELISAs in samples diluted 1:25 (Svanovir \u00ae , Svanova Biotech, Sweden), according to the manufacturers' instructions. Additionally, sera collected before vaccination were serially diluted and endpoint titers of BRSV-specific maternally derived IgG Table 2 Effect of vaccination on BRSV infection. BRSV-specific maternally derived antibodies and detection of BRSV in calves (identified as calf 'a' through 't'), immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs (n = 5), BRSV protein (n = 5) adjuvant (n = 5) or PBS (n = 5) on post infection days (PID) \u221235 and \u221214 and challenged with BRSV on PID 0.

RNA was quantified by using a dilution series of BRSV with a known TCID50 as standards included in each run. e BAL cells and inflamed lung tissue were obtained on day 6 for virus isolation, determined as visible CPE in turbinate cells after one or two passages in 25 cm 2 tissue flasks (+P1 or +P2). No visible CPE after two passages (-).\r\n f Macroscopic pathologic lung lesions on day 6, expressed as lesion percentage.\r\n antibodies were calculated by linear regression. The endpoint titers are given as reciprocals of the dilutions. The cut-off corrected OD (COD) value was set to two times the mean COD of a negative control serum provided in the kit. For BRSV-specific IgG 1 and IgG 2 antibodies, the conjugated antibody in the same kit was changed to the following monoclonal antibodies: mouse anti-bovine-IgG 2 (K1924F10) followed by rat anti-mouse-IgG 1 : HRP (LO-MG1-2) for detection of BRSV-specific IgG 2 or mouse anti-bovine-IgG 1 : HRP (IL-A60) for detection of BRSV-specific IgG 1 . Each antibody solution was added in a volume of 100 l per well and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C, prior to three washes with 0.05% PBS-Tween solution A capture ELISA was used for detection of BRSV-specific IgA, according to Uttenthal et al. [33] , but with the following modifications: ELISA plates (MaxiSorp, Nunc TM , Denmark) were coated 18 h at 4 \u2022 C with mouse anti-bovine-IgA (IL-A71) and blocked for 1 h at 25 \u2022 C with PBS containing 2% (w\/v) BSA, prior to addition of samples diluted 1:25, BRSV antigen or cell control, mouse anti-BRSV N protein (Mab 6 [34] ), rat anti-mouse-IgG 1 :HRP (LO-MG1-2), TMB substrate and H 2 O 2 . Each antibody or antigen solution was added in a volume of 100 l per well and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C, prior to three washes with 0.05% PBS-Tween solution. COD values were calculated by subtracting absorbance values at 450 nm of wells containing control antigen from wells containing BRSV antigen and data were expressed as percentage of the COD of positive control sera. All monoclonal antibodies specific for bovine Ig isotypes were obtained from AbDSerotec, UK.\r\n PBMCs obtained from all animals (described in Section 2.3) were restimulated, in triplicate wells, with BRSV antigen prepared from frozen and thawed FBT cells infected with BRSV (no. 9402022, Denmark) and identical uninfected cell lysates, as described previously [35] . COD values were calculated between BRSV and control stimulated PBMCs, after six days of incubation at 37 \u2022 C and addition of Alamar Blue \u00ae reagent (Invitrogen, Sweden) 6 h prior to measurement of absorbance by spectrophotometry, according to the manufacturers' instructions. This method of counting viable cells has previously been shown to be as reliable and sensitive as radioactive methods [36] .\r\n PBMCs obtained from all animals (described in Section 2.3) were screened for the presence of IFN\u2425 and IL-4 mRNA as well as 28 rRNA by RT-qPCR. After BRSV stimulation of 800,000 PBMC per calf for 24 h at 37 \u2022 C, cells were centrifuged at 200 \u00d7 g, supernatants removed, and total RNA was extracted from the cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Sweden). The RNA purity was verified using spectrophotometry (Picodrop Ltd, UK), at OD 280\/260. The RNA samples were stored at \u221270 \u2022 C until analysed by RT-qPCR using iScript one-step RT-PCR kit for probes (Bio-Rad, Sweden) in an IQ5 qPCR machine (Bio-Rad, Sweden) with previously published standards, primers and probes, designed to exclude amplification of genomic DNA [37] . All samples were analysed in duplicate (28S rRNA) or triplicate (IFN\u2425 and IL-4 mRNA). IFN\u2425 and IL-4 mRNA results are given in relation to 28S rRNA.\r\n After fixation, the 10 lung tissue samples from each calf were paraffin wax embedded, sectioned at 3-5 m and stained with haematoxylin\/eosin and according to Luna's method for detection of eosinophil granules [38] . The sections were assessed without prior knowledge of the animal's treatment. The inflammatory changes in each lung lobe were scored as normal or mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3).\r\n Data were analysed using Minitab \u00ae 16.1.1 statistical software using ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test on square root values, when not otherwise specified. The statistical significance was set as 0.01 < p \u2264 0.05 (*); 0.001 < p \u2264 0.01 (**); p \u2264 0.001 (***).\r\n In contrast to BRSV proteins alone, adjuvant alone or PBS, the experimental BRSV-ISCOM vaccine used to immunize cattle induced clinical protection against a virulent BRSV challenge (Fig. 1 ). There was a significant reduction in the mean clinical scores of animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs vs. those immunized with adjuvant alone on PID 4 and 6 (p < 0.05). The clinical respiratory signs, observed in the majority of animals which received adjuvant or PBS, were characterized by moderate to marked mucopurulent nasal discharge, wheezing sounds on lung auscultation, tachypnea, and spontaneous coughing. However, only one calf, in the adjuvant group, had a markedly affected general condition, on the day of experiment termination (calf 'o', PID 6). On this day, the maximum rectal temperatures and respiratory rates per minute in each group were 38.9 \u2022 C, 39. \r\n In agreement with the clinical signs, animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs had on average less extensive lung lesions after BRSV challenge compared to controls (Fig. 2, Table 2 ). The mean area of macroscopic lung lesions was significantly less in animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs vs. those immunized with PBS (p < 0.01), and a similar tendency was observed vs. the adjuvant group (p = 0.09), when analysed by Student's t-test (two-tailed, with assumed equal variance), but not by ANOVA. Animals immunized with BRSV proteins alone also tended to have less gross pathological lesions when compared with calves immunized with PBS, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.09, Student's t-test). A correlation was found between clinical signs and gross pathology in animals in the BRSV-ISCOM, adjuvant and PBS groups when comparing the individual percentage of macroscopic pathologic lung lesions with the sum of clinical scores on PID \u22121 to 6 (Pearson's r = 0.81, \u22120.24, 0.84 and 0.87 for calves immunized with BRSV-ISCOM, BRSV protein, adjuvant and PBS, respectively).\r\n Upon histological examination most of the calves showed signs of bronchointerstitial pneumonia in one or several tissue sections (Fig. 3 ) . The inflammatory pattern in the animals varied between very mild nonspecific inflammatory changes to severe bronchointerstitial pneumonia with consolidation of the parenchyma and marked lymphoid peribronchial cuffing as well as presence of neutrophils and cellular debri in bronchi\/bronchioli and in alveoli. The severity of the inflammatory responses in the ten sampled areas per calf were lowest in the BRSV-ISCOM group, with a mean rank of 5.6 compared with 9.2, 11.8 and 15.4 in the BRSV protein, adjuvant and PBS group, respectively (p = 0.055, Kruskal-Wallis test) and this difference was significant for the cranial lobe (p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). In 13 animals the neutrophilic component of the inflammation was prominent in at least one tissue section, of those one animal belonged to the BRSV-ISCOM group (calf 'e', which had an extent of macroscopic lesions of 3.7%), three to the BRSV protein group, five to the adjuvant group and four to the PBS group. The calf with the worst clinical signs also had the most severe histopathological changes and a marked neutrophilic response (calf 'o', adjuvant group). Though eosinophils sometimes were present in the inflamed tissue they did not constitute the major Fig. 3 . Scoring of pulmonary histopathology in vaccinated calves following challenge with BRSV. Calves were immunized as described in Fig. 1 and microscopic lung lesions determined on PID 6. (a) Few peribronchiolar lymphocytes and absence of bronchiolitis and alveolitis (calf 'a', BRSV-ISCOM group, scored as mild). (b) Moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells in alveolar walls and septa. Small amounts of cellular debri present in bronchioli. Focal hyperplasia in peribronchiolar lymph inflammatory cell type, and no differences in eosinophilia were detected between the different groups.\r\n A strong reduction in nasopharyngeal viral excretion was observed in calves immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs when compared with all other groups of calves (Table 2) . Remarkably, viral RNA was detected by RT-qPCR on nasal swabs only in two out of five animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs (calves b and c), whereas it was detected in all controls, including those immunized with BRSV proteins alone, from PID 3 or 4 and until the end of the experiment, on PID 6 (the expected day of peak virus shedding). The reduction of nasopharyngeal viral excretion in animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs was statistically significantly different from those immunized with BRSV protein (p < 0.05, PID 6), adjuvant (p < 0.05, PID 4) or PBS (p < 0.05, PID 4-6, all by Kruskal-Wallis test). The mean quantities of viral RNA detected on PID 6, expressed as TCID 50 equivalent units \u00b1 SD, were 0.2 (\u00b10.45), 646 (\u00b1873), 379 (\u00b1335) and 682 (\u00b1882) for animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs, BRSV proteins, adjuvant or PBS, respectively. Surprisingly, those calves in the control groups which shed the highest quantities of virus also had the highest levels of BRSV-specific, maternally derived, IgG antibodies at challenge (calves g, o and q; Table 2 , Fig. 4 ). The mean quantities of BRSV RNA detected in BAL cells on PID 6 were 0.3, 4.34, 4.52 and 4.99 log 10 TCID 50 equivalent units\/10 6 28S copies for animals in the BRSV-ISCOM, BRSV protein, adjuvant and PBS groups, respectively. One sample for each of the protein and adjuvant group (calves j and n) was not quantified, however, due to insufficient RNA material for the 28S analysis.\r\n In agreement with the RT-qPCR data, animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs had strongly reduced quantities of live virus in the lung, as determined by virus isolation attempts on BAL and lung tissue from PID 6 ( Table 2) . BRSV was isolated only from one out of five animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs: from BAL cells on the second virus passage (calf 'c'), whereas isolation was possible from BAL cells of all controls and from lung tissue of 10 out of 15 controls, on the first virus passage.\r\n A decline of BRSV-specific, maternally derived, IgG antibodies was observed from first sampling until vaccination in the calves immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs and BRSV proteins and until the end of study in the adjuvant and PBS controls, demonstrating the absence of natural BRSV-infections (Fig. 4) . All calves but one (calf 's') had BRSV-specific, maternally derived, IgG antibodies before vaccination, with titers varying between 1\/25 and 1\/228 (Table 2) .\r\n No adverse immunological reactions were observed after the first vaccination, despite careful clinical examination. Conversely, 12 h after the second vaccination, all animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs or adjuvant alone developed local reactions (flat swellings, up to hand palm size) and increased rectal temperatures (40.0-40.3 \u2022 C), which both remained up to 48 h. The animals continued to have a good appetite for milk and pellets during this period. No reactions were observed in animals immunized with BRSV proteins or PBS, and their rectal temperatures remained normal. There was no significant difference in calf bodyweights at first vaccination, nor in daily weight gains between first vaccination aggregates (calf 'p', PBS group, scored as moderate). (c) Bronchointerstitial pneumonia with consolidation of the parenchyma, marked inflammatory peribronchial cuffing and presence of neutrophils and cellular debri in bronchi\/bronchioli and in alveoli (calf 'k', adjuvant group, scored as severe). and challenge between the different immunization groups (neither with ANOVA, nor with Student's t-test, data not shown). Formulation of BRSV antigens into BRSV-ISCOMs was required for induction of serum IgG responses after a single injection (Fig. 4) . Indeed, BRSV-specific serum IgG tended to increase after priming in four out of five animals immunized by BRSV-ISCOMs, but in none of the animals immunized with BRSV protein. Furthermore, strong IgG responses were induced in all animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs rapidly after the boost, contrasting with weak responses induced and only in two out of five animals immunized with BRSV proteins alone. Sera from PID \u22122 and PID 5 were further verified by BRSV-specific IgA, IgG 1 and IgG 2 ELISAs (Fig. 5a-c) . Significantly higher IgA, IgG 1 and IgG 2 responses were detected in serum from the animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs compared to all controls (IgA PID 5 p < 0.05, IgG 1 and IgG 2 PID \u22122 and 5, p < 0.0001). Within the BRSV-ISCOM group, calf 'a' showed the weakest serum IgG 2 responses, although this individual had high serum levels of IgG 1 and high BRSV-specific lymphocyte proliferation responses both before and after challenge (Figs. 5 and 7). This calf was the only one in its group that developed fever after challenge (40.5 \u2022 C, PID 2) but did not shed detectable virus (Table 2) .\r\n Significantly higher levels of BRSV-specific IgA and IgG were detected in nasal fluids of animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs compared to all control groups (IgA PID 5, p < 0.005, IgG PID \u22121 and 5, p < 0.001, Fig. 6 ). Those calves immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs that shed detectable virus had the largest decrease in nasal IgG after challenge (calves b and c, Fig. 6 ). BRSV-specific IgA and IgG were furthermore detected in the lungs on PID 6 (Fig. 7) , and levels were significantly greater in animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs (IgA and IgG, p < 0.01). In the BRSV-ISCOM group the mean ratio of IgA to IgG in BAL was 121 (range 8-536) whereas the opposite was found in the nose with a mean ratio of 0 and 1 on PID \u22121 and 5, respectively (PID \u22121, range 0.06-0.13; PID 5 range 0.37-1.34). The three calves with the highest levels of IgA in BAL were the only calves in which no virus was detected in nasal swabs (calf 'a', 'd' and 'e', Fig. 7a , Table 2 ).\r\n The complete ISCOM formulation was also required for the induction of BRSV-specific lymphocyte proliferative responses before and after challenge (Fig. 8) . Two days before challenge, BRSV-specific T-cell proliferation was detected in two out of five calves immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs, which was more than in control groups but not significantly different (Fig. 8) . However, four days after challenge, lymphocytes from four out of five animals in the BRSV-ISCOM group proliferated after restimulation, in vitro, with BRSV antigen. In contrast, a BRSV-specific lymphocyte proliferative response was not detected in any of the control calves or in calves immunized with BRSV proteins alone. These results were reproducible using two additional dilutions of BRSV antigen for the restimulation, all tested in triplicate for each sample (data not shown). Lymphocytes from all animals at all sample occasions proliferated when stimulated with Concanavalin A, demonstrating cell viability (COD ranging between 0.2 and 0.6).\r\n Increased IFN\u2425 and IL-4 mRNA expression was detected in BRSVstimulated PBMC obtained from calves immunized with complete ISCOMs (Fig. 9 ). After 24 h stimulation with BRSV antigen, PBMC collected after challenge from BRSV-ISCOM immunized animals contained significantly more IFN\u2425 and IL-4 mRNA per reference gene compared with those collected from animals immunized with adjuvant or PBS (IFN\u2425 p < 0.05, IL-4 p < 0.01). There was also a significantly stronger induction of IL-4 mRNA in PBMC from animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs compared with those immunized with BRSV proteins (p < 0.05). The IFN\u2425 mRNA levels were on average 46 times higher than those for IL-4 among animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs, which however did not significantly differ from the ratio among controls (average 22, 14 and 18 for BRSV-protein, adjuvant and PBS). Similar patterns were observed in PBMC collected after boost but before challenge. Additionally, within the BRSV-ISCOM group, the individual levels of IFN\u2425 and IL-4 mRNA correlated perfectly to the degree of virological protection, when not standardized against 28S (data not shown).\r\n In this paper we demonstrate highly significant protection induced by BRSV-ISCOMs despite the presence of BRSV-specific maternal antibodies at the time of vaccination. We thus extend the previous finding in 7-15-week-old calves [27] , to 3-8-week old calves, representing a more relevant target population for BRSV vaccination. Supporting earlier data, BRSV-ISCOMs provided clinical protection and a highly significant reduction in virus excretion from the upper respiratory tract of calves, associated with rapid systemic and nasal antibody responses. Additionally, virological protection of the lower respiratory tract was associated with local and systemic humoral responses as well as T cell responses dominated by IFN\u2425 production. Moreover, we study the safety of this experimental vaccine through clinical and pathological investigations. The absence of clinical signs and the character of pulmonary cellular responses upon succeeding virulent BRSV infection, without excess of neutrophils or eosinophils, indicated good safety of the BRSV-ISCOM vaccine, although this should be further Fig. 6 . BRSV-specific antibody responses in nasal fluids of vaccinated calves. Calves (identified as calf 'a' through 't') were immunized as described in Fig. 1 and challenged with BRSV on PID 0. Nasal fluids were obtained by tampon on PID \u22121 (dark grey bars) and PID 5 (light grey bars). Tampons were washed with 3 ml PBS and samples were then diluted 1:25 before analysis by ELISA for IgA (a) and IgG (b). Corrected OD (COD) values are presented as percent of positive reference sera.\r\n confirmed. By including a group of animals immunized with BRSV proteins alone, we showed that the protective immunological response to these proteins was dependent on ISCOM borne antigen presentation.\r\n BRSV-ISCOMs induced a strong protection of calves at an age when they are likely to be susceptible to BRSV infection and during which protection is difficult to achieve. The age of animal at first immunization was extended from 7-15 weeks [27] to 3-8 weeks in the present study.\r\n In accordance with previous experiments using the same experimental model [9, 27] , the clinical signs observed in controls mimicked those observed after natural BRSV infection in the field, including fever and tachypnea in individuals with maternal antibodies at challenge. As previously reported after natural and experimental BRSV infection [3, 9, 39] , the clinical signs of disease varied within the control groups. Standard deviations were used to illustrate this variation, instead of standard error of the mean that is often misused for this purpose [40] . The variations in clinical signs and pathology might have been due to the short time between challenge and euthanasia and being the result of the variation in the time needed to develop disease, but were most probably influenced by other factors. The three control calves with most severe tachypnea and gross pathology, also had the highest levels of BRSV-specific maternal IgG at challenge and the highest viral loads in nasal secretions, within their groups, and were among the oldest and youngest. This supports the suggestion that maternal antibodies are not fully protective and that T-cell and\/or mucosal antibody responses play an important role in protection. Hypothetically, the severe disease in these three control calves could be linked to individual genetic variation in the response to BRSV infection, as has been suggested in the case of HRSV [41] and other animal viral infections [42] . Calves (identified as calf 'a' through 't') were immunized as described in Fig. 1 and challenged with BRSV on PID 0. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained on PID \u22123 or \u22122 (before challenge, dark grey bars) and PID 4 or 5 (after challenge, light grey bars), and were stimulated with BRSV or control antigen. Proliferation is expressed as corrected OD values (mean of triplicate) after six days of stimulation and addition of Alamar Blue \u00ae reagent. In contrast to controls, the animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs were protected against clinical signs of disease. The clinical scorings were further supported by lung function measurements by forced oscillation. This method, originally evaluated in calves using broncho-modulatory treatments [43] , could potentially be used to improve the objectiveness of clinical assessments in any respiratory infection model of calves, as will be discussed elsewhere (Pringle et al., in preparation) .\r\n The ability of BRSV-ISCOMs to induce efficient clinical protection following BRSV challenge was associated with a highly significant virological protection in both the upper and lower respiratory tract. Several animals possessing BRSV-specific maternal antibodies at the time of first immunization appeared to be completely protected since no nasal virus shedding was detected by RT-qPCR. This technique was chosen to increase the virus detection sensitivity compared to other vaccine evaluations in BRSV seropositive calves, which used virus isolation alone [21, [24] [25] [26] . Indeed, high quantities of viral RNA were found in respiratory samples from all controls.\r\n The repeated demonstration of limited or no virus shedding in BRSV-ISCOM immunized animals inevitably led to the question whether viral replication is completely prevented in certain animals after challenge. From the data presented herein it is evident that replication did occur, although only very low levels of viral RNA were detected in BAL of BRSV-ISCOM immunized animals, six days after inoculation. Moreover, one such animal harbored live virus in the lung, although, in contrast to all controls, this was not detectable at first virus passage. The ease of virus isolation from controls highlights the virulence of the challenge and it remains to be investigated if the low amounts of virus detected in the BRSV-ISCOM group would transmit to sentinels. Our data suggest that BRSV-ISCOMs would have an impact on BRSV transmission in the field.\r\n Not only must a new BRSV vaccine candidate be efficient, but also safe. The adverse reactions in the BRSV-ISCOM and adjuvant group upon boosting were of similar extent as can be observed with commercial cattle vaccines. These reactions were probably linked to the Quillaja saponin component that was increased from 5 to 13 times that of the lipids and proteins compared to previously [27] . Besides not causing direct toxicity and acute hypersensitivity reactions, BRSV vaccines must not induce exaggerated inflammatory responses upon natural infection. Indeed, this has been a problem both for vaccines against BRSV in cattle and against the closely related HRSV in man. In the 1960s a formalin inactivated (FI)-HRSV vaccine induced severe pulmonary neutrophilia in children, with the presence of eosinophils in fatal cases [17] . The vaccine induced enhanced disease has been reproduced experimentally in mice and cattle, with reduced IFN\u2425 production and even more prominent pulmonary eosinophilia [44] . In small animal models FI-HRSV induces Th2-skewed immune responses that may be responsible for bronchoconstriction and inflammation following RSV infection (reviewed by Castilow and Varga and Meyer et al. [45, 46] ).\r\n Although no or only very mild clinical signs of disease have been recorded in ISCOM immunized calves after BRSV challenge, it is necessary to characterize the pulmonary inflammatory response providing the strong limitation of viral replication. This was further highlighted by Chen et al. [47] , who observed virological protection associated with peribronchiolary inflammation and increased eosinophils in BAL of HRSV-ISCOM immunized mice after HRSV challenge. No clinical signs of disease were reported in that study. Our vaccination protocol and challenge model did induce influx of leucocytes into limited areas of the lungs after virulent BRSV challenge, however, no increase in numbers of cells was observed compared to controls. A deeper characterization of the pulmonary cellular response to infection in ISCOM-immunized animals is presently ongoing.\r\n The immunological response was investigated herein by several other approaches. As in the previous experiment [27] , not only were the systemic and local humoral responses very rapid and strong after boosting; four out of five animals showed an antibody response after a single injection. Furthermore, as the limited virus detection in ISCOM immunized animals was not associated with pre-vaccination passive antibody status, ISCOMs capacity to overcome maternal immunity was confirmed.\r\n Although being one of the major problems in vaccinology and relevant for a broad range of pathogens, the exact mechanisms responsible for the inhibitory effects of maternally derived antibodies on active immunization are still not fully understood. It is clear, however, that this inhibition is determinant-specific and occurs primarily on B-cells, probably by antibody masking of epitopes on vaccine antigens and preventing the binding to these cells. There is possibly also interference with antigen uptake and presentation, although cellular responses are much less affected than humoral responses [48] . Notably, even if a BRSV specific T-cell memory can be induced in the presence of maternal antibodies in calves [49] , the antibody responses, induced by commercial vaccines in previous studies, were commonly absent [26] and the induced clinical protection was poor in a model reproducing the clinical signs of disease observed in the field [27] .\r\n The mechanisms by which ISCOMs overcome the inhibiting effect of maternal antibodies is unknown. One possibility is that the effect is due to the antigen dose in relation to the level of maternal antibodies [50] . However, as will be described in detail elsewhere (H\u00e4gglund et al., in preparation [51] ), one dose of BRSV-ISCOMs contained less than 100 g BRSV proteins, which is 3-20 times less than that in other subunit BRSV vaccines administered to calves [52, 53] . Nevertheless, given the weak responses induced by BRSV proteins alone, the presence of antigens in the form of ISCOM particles, and\/or the effect of adjuvant component, was essential. We are presently investigating whether the incorporation of BRSV-proteins into ISCOMs is required or alternatively whether similar immunogenicity can be obtained with the antigens mixed with commercially available, pre-formed empty ISCOMs or another adjuvant.\r\n The capacity of ISCOMs to prime for rapid IgA production after challenge was confirmed, as previously shown in serum [27] , and now in BAL and nasal fluids of immunized and challenged animals. Similarly, long lasting pulmonary IgA was induced after intranasal BRSV-ISCOM immunization of mice [54] . In contrast, low levels of pulmonary IgG were detected in BAL, probably due to high dilution of samples, which further suggests that the IgA was actively transported into the lung and present in very high amounts. The two calves in the ISCOM group that shed detectable amounts of virus had the lowest levels of pulmonary BRSV-specific IgA within their group.\r\n Although IgA has been related to Th2 cytokines in mice, the presence of ISCOMs in the vaccine skewed the immune responses of calves more towards Th1, confirming earlier publications [55] . Thus, in contrast to calves immunized with BRSV protein alone, the animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs rapidly acquired serum IgG 2 , an immunoglobulin associated with Th1 cytokines. Furthermore, a similar pattern was seen for the induction of IgG 2a in mice (data not shown). Since the IgG 1 and IgG 2 assays were normalized against different positive control sera, it is not possible to compare the concentrations of these parameters. However, bearing in mind that at four months of age, calves have normally similar levels of total IgG 1 as adult cattle, whereas total IgG 2 then is only half of adult levels [56] , and that IgG 2 is complement activating [57, 58] ; the presence of this antibody isotype might be linked to protection or associated with a strong T-cell response.\r\n The powerful antibody responses were probably associated with the ability of ISCOMs to induce strong and balanced T-helper cell responses, as assessed by restimulation of PBMCs with killed antigens ex vivo, for antigen presentation on MHC II to memory T helper cells. After stimulation, PBMCs from BRSV-ISCOM immunized animals showed significantly higher levels of IFN\u2425 and IL-4 mRNA per cell than those from controls, with about 10-160 times higher levels of IFN\u2425 than IL-4 mRNA. Additionally, significantly higher lymphocyte proliferative responses were induced in animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs, indicating that their lymphocytes would both undergo efficient clonal expansion and produce more cytokines per cell, upon BRSV infection. This remains to be verified in vivo. Bovine IL-4 is generally associated with enhanced B-cell survival and IgG 1 antibody production in cattle, whereas IFN\u2425 is normally linked to a Th1 type of response with production of IgG 2 and activation of macrophages as well as cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL, reviewed by Estes and Brown [57] ). ISCOMs have previously shown an exceptional capacity to induce CTL responses, possibly by enabling B-cell cross-presentation of killed antigens to na\u00efve CD8+ lymphocytes [58] , and this will be investigated for BRSV in the future. Supposedly, the marked IFN\u2425 and the moderate IL-4 mRNA inductions were promoted by ISCOM induction of type I interferons, which in bovine in vitro systems has been shown to induce not only IgG 2 , but also IgA production [59] . IFN\u2425 additionally upregulates the production of IgA secretory component and IgA transcytosis by human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro [60] .\r\n In summary, BRSV-ISCOMs is an efficient inactivated vaccine that mimics a natural BRSV infection in that it strongly primes for production of IFN\u2425 mRNA from lymphocytes and local as well as systemic immunity, with particularly strong IgA pulmonary responses, without disease enhancing effects.","sha":"93b2561f6153fa11b68d905215018f103aa31a17","publish_time":"2011-11-03","authors":"H\u00e4gglund, Sara; Hu, Kefei; Vargmar, Karin; Por\u00e9, Lesly; Olofson, Ann-Sophie; Blod\u00f6rn, Krister; Anderson, Jenna; Ahooghalandari, Parvin; Pringle, John; Taylor, Geraldine; Valarcher, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois","journal":"Vaccine","doi":"10.1016\/j.vaccine.2011.07.146","Title":"Vaccine","H index":164.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), a member of the pneumovirus genus in the Paramyxoviridae family, is a major pathogen in the respiratory disease complex of cattle [1] [2] [3] .

In previous studies, we used a virulent BRSV model and PCR to compare the efficacy of a conventional inactivated vaccine with an experimental vaccine in 7-15 weeks old calves with maternal antibodies, with exceptional results: the conventional vaccine very poorly protected calves with maternal antibodies, whereas the experimental vaccine, BRSV immunostimulating complexes (BRSV-ISCOMs), conferred strong clinical as well as nearly complete viral protection against a heterologous BRSV strain [27] . 9402022, Denmark) was propagated in vero cells for production of ISCOMs. The seventh passage of the same BRSV isolate, propagated in FBT cells, was used for the experimental challenge, as described earlier [27] .

The animals continued to have a good appetite for milk and pellets during this period.

Furthermore, strong IgG responses were induced in all animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs rapidly after the boost, contrasting with weak responses induced and only in two out of five animals immunized with BRSV proteins alone. Two days before challenge, BRSV-specific T-cell proliferation was detected in two out of five calves immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs, which was more than in control groups but not significantly different (Fig. Similar patterns were observed in PBMC collected after boost but before challenge. Moreover, we study the safety of this experimental vaccine through clinical and pathological investigations. Calves (identified as calf 'a' through 't') were immunized as described in Fig. Corrected OD (COD) values are presented as percent of positive reference sera. Standard deviations were used to illustrate this variation, instead of standard error of the mean that is often misused for this purpose [40] . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained on PID \u22123 or \u22122 (before challenge, dark grey bars) and PID 4 or 5 (after challenge, light grey bars), and were stimulated with BRSV or control antigen. The clinical scorings were further supported by lung function measurements by forced oscillation. This method, originally evaluated in calves using broncho-modulatory treatments [43] , could potentially be used to improve the objectiveness of clinical assessments in any respiratory infection model of calves, as will be discussed elsewhere (Pringle et al., From the data presented herein it is evident that replication did occur, although only very low levels of viral RNA were detected in BAL of BRSV-ISCOM immunized animals, six days after inoculation. Not only must a new BRSV vaccine candidate be efficient, but also safe. In the 1960s a formalin inactivated (FI)-HRSV vaccine induced severe pulmonary neutrophilia in children, with the presence of eosinophils in fatal cases [17] . Although no or only very mild clinical signs of disease have been recorded in ISCOM immunized calves after BRSV challenge, it is necessary to characterize the pulmonary inflammatory response providing the strong limitation of viral replication. This was further highlighted by Chen et al. [ No clinical signs of disease were reported in that study. The immunological response was investigated herein by several other approaches. Although being one of the major problems in vaccinology and relevant for a broad range of pathogens, the exact mechanisms responsible for the inhibitory effects of maternally derived antibodies on active immunization are still not fully understood. in preparation [51] ), one dose of BRSV-ISCOMs contained less than 100 g BRSV proteins, which is 3-20 times less than that in other subunit BRSV vaccines administered to calves [52, 53] . Thus, in contrast to calves immunized with BRSV protein alone, the animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs rapidly acquired serum IgG 2 , an immunoglobulin associated with Th1 cytokines. However, bearing in mind that at four months of age, calves have normally similar levels of total IgG 1 as adult cattle, whereas total IgG 2 then is only half of adult levels [56] , and that IgG 2 is complement activating [57, 58] ; the presence of this antibody isotype might be linked to protection or associated with a strong T-cell response."},{"Unnamed: 0":68,"Unnamed: 0.1":68,"doc_id":"a127d89f4ccefa2f8f5816f432a6af8ccad7043b","title":"Intramuscular immunization with a vesicular stomatitis virus recombinant expressing the influenza hemagglutinin provides post-exposure protection against lethal influenza challenge NIH Public Access Author Manuscript","abstract":"Vaccines currently licensed for the prevention of seasonal influenza induce antibodies against the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) contained in the vaccine preparation but require at least two weeks after immunization for the development of protective immunity. These vaccines do not induce protective responses quickly enough to blunt the effects of infection when administered after exposure. We have developed a novel vaccine based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus which expresses the influenza hemagglutinin (rVSV HA) and protects mice from lethal influenza challenge when the vaccine is administered intramuscularly at least 24 hours after delivery of the influenza challenge virus. To our knowledge this is the first vaccine that effectively protects animals from lethal influenza challenge when delivered by a systemic route after influenza exposure has occurred. The induction of HA-specific immune responses by the vaccine is necessary for full protection from challenge, because animals immunized with an empty rVSV vector were not protected equally. Our results are consistent with a model in which vaccination induces an immediate antiviral cytokine response, followed by development of humoral and cellular immune responses which act to reduce pulmonary viral loads and accelerate recovery. Consistent with this model, mice vaccinated with the specific vaccine rVSV HA had high levels of IFN-\u03b1 in the serum by 24 hours after challenge\/vaccination, developed serum neutralizing Ab to influenza two days prior to control animals, and had detectable anti-HA CD8 T cells present in the peripheral blood three days prior to control mice.","text_body":"Vaccines against infectious microorganisms are usually administered prophylactically, and protective immunity is generated in the vaccinated individual before the vaccinee encounters the pathogen against which the vaccine protects. In emergent circumstances however, prophylactic vaccination is often impractical or ineffective. Vaccines against smallpox [1] , rabies [2] , and hepatitis B [3] can generate protective immunity in humans even when the vaccines are administered after exposure to these viruses has occurred. The mechanism(s) of post-exposure protection have not been defined for these vaccines, but innate and adaptive immune responses are probably induced by the vaccine before the infecting virus can establish fulminant infection or cause significant pathology. There are currently two licensed vaccines for the prevention of seasonal influenza in humans, both of which are administered prophylactically. The conventional inactivated vaccine is administered by injection and is a trivalent cocktail of circulating influenza strains (2 influenza A strains and 1 influenza B strain) which are formalin-inactivated and \"lipid-split\" to enrich for the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The alternate vaccine is a live cold-adapted virus preparation (FluMist \u2122 ) which is administered intranasally [4] . FluMist also contains two influenza A and one influenza B strains. The influenza strains included in the vaccines are selected based upon the recommendation of the World Health Organization, which samples emerging and circulating influenza viruses to determine those most likely to cause disease in humans in a given year. Both vaccine preparations induce anti-influenza neutralizing antibodies in vaccinees, and protection is assumed to depend upon the action of those antibodies. Both types of influenza vaccine are administered prior to the circulation of influenza virus in a community, allowing time for protective immunity to develop before individuals are likely to encounter influenza virus naturally. The timing of seasonal influenza epidemics is generally predictable, and existing vaccines protect well as long as the identity of the predominant circulating strains is predicted correctly. However, a significant limitation of existing influenza vaccines is that they require a minimum of two weeks to establish protective immunity in the vaccinee [5] , making them unsuitable for use as a post-exposure therapeutic. In addition, existing vaccines do not protect at all against highly pathogenic avian influenzas (influenza A\/H5N1, HPAI). Human infection with recently emerged HPAI has a mortality of up to 81% [6, 7] . Current avian influenza strains are not efficiently transmitted from human to human but the high mutation rate of the virus, the increasing incidence of human infection, and the isolated reports of human to human transmission [8] [9] [10] suggest that the virus will eventually acquire that ability. Because it is not possible to predict precisely when HPAI will acquire the ability to transmit between humans, or what the pandemic strain might be, the development of an influenza vaccine that could generate protective immunity in the shortest time possible after immunization would be highly desirable. In May of this year, a novel H1N1 virus (H1N1 swine flu) with the potential for pandemic spread [11, 12] emerged in the human population. The vaccine that has been developed against the novel H1N1 induces antibody titers predictive of protection by 2-3 weeks after immunization [13, 14] , but because the vaccine strain did not grow well in eggs, thereby limiting vaccine production efficiency, it is likely that a large portion of the population will not be vaccinated during the height of the natural flu season. We have developed a novel rVSV-based vaccine that addresses some of the weaknesses of existing influenza vaccines. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccines rapidly induce cellular and humoral responses when administered systemically or mucosally, and are protective against a wide range of infectious challenges when administered prophylactically [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . In addition, a recent series of reports demonstrated that an rVSV expressing the Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein could protect macaques from lethal EBOV challenge when administered within 20 minutes after EBOV challenge and when the challenge and vaccine viruses were delivered by the same route [21] [22] [23] [24] . The mechanism by which the VSV-based EBOV vaccine protects has not been determined, and the inherent challenges in working with EBOV in non-human primates make mechanistic experiments difficult to complete. Because the vaccine and challenge viruses were delivered by the same route, it is possible that the VSV-EBOV vaccine virus competed directly for host cell binding, and\/or that the vaccine induced innate and adaptive responses which blunted the effects of EBOV infection. We undertook the present study to determine whether a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the hemagglutinin (rVSV HA) of influenza A\/PR\/8\/34 (PR8) could protect animals from influenza challenge when administered after exposure to influenza had occurred. We report here that 100% of Balb\/C mice immunized intramuscularly with rVSV HA within 24 hours of high dose influenza challenge were protected from mortality. Mice immunized with an empty rVSV vector were partially but not equally protected, suggesting that innate immune responses to rVSV contributed to protection but that full protection and recovery from challenge required development of antigen specific responses. Protection was likely dependent upon the combined action of innate, cellular, and humoral factors, as mice vaccinated with rVSV HA had high levels of IFN-\u03b1 in the serum and lung within 24 hours after challenge, and had detectable antiinfluenza antibody and CD8 T cell responses prior to those detected in control animals. These results demonstrate that therapeutic immunization with an rVSV based vaccine can rescue animals from death and significant morbidity after high dose influenza challenge, and may represent an alternative to the use of current influenza vaccines in emergency situations where conventional immunization is not practical or effective. Because our model makes use of a well characterized virus and uses inbred mice as the host organism, further mechanistic studies to determine the precise mechanism(s) of action of this effective post-exposure vaccine will be feasible.\r\n To obtain plasmids that could be used to recover rVSV expressing influenza genes from the first or fifth position in the VSV genome, influenza gene sequences (influenza strain A\/PR\/ 8\/34) were PCR-amplified from plasmids generously provided by Dr. Peter Palese (Mt. Sinai School of Medicine). The forward primer introduced a Sal I site upstream of the coding sequence and the reverse primer introduced an Nhe I site. PCR products were digested with Xho I and Nhe I, purified, and ligated into the pVSVXN2 vector that had been digested with the same enzymes (VSV cloning vectors provided by Dr. John Rose, Yale University). pVSVXN2 allows insertion of the foreign gene in the fifth position of the VSV genome. Plasmids were recovered after transformation of E. coli and purified using a Maxi kit (QIAGEN) and the insert sequences verified (Duke Sequencing Facility). Recombinant virus was recovered from the pVSVXN2 HA plasmid as described previously [25] . Briefly, BHK-21 cells were grown to 50% confluency and infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 with vTF7-3, vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. One hour after infection, cells were transfected with 10 \u03bcg of the plasmid encoding the full length VSV genome plus foreign gene of interest along with 3 \u03bcg of pBluescript-N (pBS-N), 5 \u03bcg of pBS-P, 1 \u03bcg of pBS-L, and 4 \u03bcg of pBS-G (VSV Indiana serotype). While pBS-G is not required for recovery of recombinants, it was included to enhance efficiency. After 48 hours, cell supernatants were passaged onto BHK-21 cells through a 0.2\u03bcM filter, and medium containing virus was collected about 24 h after cytopathic effect was seen. Virus grown from individual plaques was used to prepare stocks that were grown on BHK-21 cells and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\r\n BHK cells (10 6 ) were infected at an MOI of 20 with VSV recombinant or control virus. After 5 hrs, medium was removed and cells were washed twice with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Methionine-free DMEM (1 ml) containing 100 \u03bcCi of [ 35 S]-methionine was added to each plate for two additional hours. Medium was removed, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed with 500 \u03bcl of detergent solution (1%Nonidet P-40, 0.4% deoxycholate, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 62.5 mM EDTA) on ice for 5 min, and collected into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. The protein extracts were centrifuged for 2 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g to remove the nuclei and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Protein extracts were fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 15% acrylamide), and proteins were visualized by autoradiography.\r\n Eight to ten-week-old female Balb\/C mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and housed for at least 1 week before experiments were initiated. Mice were housed in microisolator cages in a biosafety level 2-equipped animal facility. Viral stocks were diluted to appropriate titers in serum-free DMEM. For intramuscular vaccination (i.m.), mice were injected with the indicated amount of virus(es) in 50\u03bcl total volume. For intranasal (i.n.) challenge with influenza, mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane using a vaporizer and administered the indicated amount of virus in 40\u03bcl total volume. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Duke University approved all animal experiments. After influenza challenge mice were monitored daily for weight loss and change in body temperature (Physitemp rodent thermometer, Physitemp Inc., Clifton, NJ).\r\n with 1mg\/mouse of a monoclonal antibody (Clone YTS 169AG 101HL) reactive against CD8\u03b1. Mice received injections on day \u22123, day \u22121, and day +6 after challenge. Depletion of CD8 T cells was confirmed (in the blood and peripheral blood) by flow cytometry on Day 0 and Day 14 of the study.\r\n To obtain peripheral blood lymphocytes blood was collected into serum free medium (DMEM) containing heparin. Blood was layered onto a Ficoll gradient and spun, after which lymphocytes were collected from the interface. Cells were washed and resuspended in DMEM containing 5% FCS. To obtain lymphocytes from the lung, mice were sacrificed via anesthetic overdose and lungs aseptically removed. Lungs were chopped into fine pieces, and digested for 2hrs at 37 in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 150U\/ml collagenase (Worthington Labs), and 20\u03bcg\/ml DNase (Sigma). After digestion the cells were pushed through a metal sieve, filtered through a 70 micron filter and layered onto a Ficoll gradient (Lympholyte M, Cedarlane Labs). Lymphocytes were collected from the interface and washed 2x before staining. Staining was performed on freshly isolated lymphocytes as previously described [26] . Briefly, approximately 5\u00d710 6 cells were added to the wells of a 96-well V-bottom plate and were blocked with unconjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes) and F c block (Pharmingen) for 15 min at room temperature (RT). Following a 5-min centrifugation at 500 \u00d7 g, lymphocytes were labeled with a FITC-conjugated anti-CD62L antibody, (Pharmingen), an allophycocyaninconjugated anti-CD8 antibody (Pharmingen), and tetramer for 30 min at RT. The tetramer was a PE-conjugated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I K d tetramer (NIH Tetramer Facility) containing the H-2K d restricted peptide HA 533-541 (N-IYSTVASSL-C). Shaminoculated control animals were used to determine background levels of tetramer binding. Background was routinely less than 0.1% and was subtracted from all reported percentages.\r\n A microneutralization assay was performed as described in [27] . Heat-inactivated serum from immunized or control animals was serially diluted and incubated with virus for one hour at RT. Residual infectivity was detected on MDCK cells after a 4 day culture period. Neutralizing titer was defined as the highest dilution of serum that completely neutralized infectivity of 10 5 TCID 50 of PR8 influenza virus. Infectivity was defined by presence of cpe on day four post infection.\r\n Mice were sacrificed via anesthetic overdose and lungs removed aseptically. After dissection lungs were, weighed, and homogenized in sterile buffer (100\u03bcl buffer per 0.1g organ weight). Homogenates were titered by standard plaque assay on MDCK cells in the presence of 1\u03bcg\/ ml TPCK-trypsin (Sigma) and using a solid agar overlay to detect infectious influenza virus. Another aliquot was titered on BHK-21 cells to detect infectious VSV. After 72 hrs (influenza) or 48 hrs (VSV) the overlay was removed and the cell layer stained with crystal violet to visualize plaques. No infectious VSV was detected in the lungs of mice tested in these studies.\r\n All statistical tests were performed using Graph Pad Prism statistical analysis software. Results were considered significant when P<0.05 was reached. Specific analyses used are indicated in the text and figure legends.\r\n To obtain a replication competent rVSV expressing the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) we inserted DNA encoding the influenza hemagglutinin from the pathogenic mouse-adapted influenza A\/PR\/8\/34 (provided by Dr. Peter Palese) into plasmid vector pVSV XN2 (provided by Dr. John Rose). This allowed recovery of rVSV expressing influenza hemagglutinin from the fifth transcribed gene in the VSV genome (diagrammed in Figure 1A ). Expression of influenza HA in cells infected with the recombinant was verified by metabolic labeling with 35 S-methionine, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography ( Figure 1B ). In cells infected with the VSV recombinants we detected the indicated VSV proteins as well as a new protein band with the mobility (size) expected for the influenza HA. Surface expression of HA on the surface of infected cells was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining of cells infected with the recombinant ( Figure 1C ). For foreign proteins to be efficiently incorporated into the VSV envelope, the cytoplasmic tail of the foreign protein must be replaced with the VSV G tail [28] . We elected not to attach the VSV tail to HA. Therefore, since this virus retains the VSV G, and does not efficiently incorporate HA into the VSV envelope, it is likely that infection of host cells is mediated almost entirely by VSV G and not by the inserted HA. Expression of foreign genes in rVSVs can, but does not always, attenuate the rVSV [29] . To determine whether expression of hemagglutinin reduced the ability of the rVSV HA to replicate in vitro we performed a one-step growth curve. As shown in Figure 2 the recombinant virus (rVSV HA) grew to equivalent titers as the parent virus (VSV rwt), indicating that the expression of influenza HA does not attenuate rVSV HA in vitro.\r\n We have shown previously that rVSV HA expressing the HA from influenza A\/PR\/8\/34 (PR8) protects mice from morbidity and mortality when mice are immunized with the rVSV HA 6-8 weeks before influenza challenge [20] . To determine whether rVSV HA protected mice from morbidity and mortality when rVSV HA was delivered after influenza challenge we performed the experiment shown in Figure 3 . Adult Balb\/C mice were challenged intranasally with 100MLD 50 PR8 influenza in a total volume of 40\u03bcl. Immediately (within 1-2 minutes) after influenza challenge, mice were either intramuscularly mock-immunized with diluent alone (n=10, No VSV), immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV empty vector (VSV rwt, n=5), or immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV HA (rVSV HA, n=10). As shown in Figure 3A , all (10\/10) rVSV HA vaccinated Balb\/C mice survived, and the rate of survival of mice immunized with rVSV HA was significantly higher than the rate of survival of mockimmunized mice (no VSV, P=0.0012, Mantel-Cox test) or of mice immunized with empty vector VSV rwt (VSV rwt, P=0.0082, Mantel Cox test). Two of the five mice immunized with the empty vector VSV rwt survived, but the rate of survival in VSV rwt immunized animals was not significantly different from that of mock-immunized mice (P=0.748, Mantel-Cox test). This suggested that the VSV rwt empty vector conferred partial protection, but that specific responses were ultimately required for complete protection. Consistent with this idea, the weight loss pattern of mice vaccinated with rVSV HA diverged significantly from that of mice vaccinated with empty vector VSV rwt from the seventh day after challenge onward, with rVSV HA immunized mice recovering more rapidly ( Figure 3B ) than those immunized with VSV rwt. Between days 0 and 2 after challenge\/immunization all rVSV immunized mice had a transient weight loss of approximately 10% pre-infection body weight. Weight loss in mice immunized with high doses of VSV correlates with host production of TNF-\u03b1 and typically resolves by 3-4 days post immunization [30] . Flu-challenged mice not receiving VSV did not lose weight during this time (No VSV group, days 0-2 post challenge, Figure 3B ) which supported the idea that the initial weight loss was due to VSV and not to influenza pathogenesis. In combination with weight loss, measurement of temperature depression during the acute phase of murine influenza infection is a sensitive indicator of pathology [31] . A decrease in the magnitude of temperature loss indicates a better clinical outcome and enhanced likelihood of survival. Consistent with the observation that immunization with rVSV induces systemic production of TNF-\u03b1 [30] , mice immunized with both VSV rwt and rVSV HA had transiently raised temperatures (of up to 1 C) during the first 24 hours after challenge, which returned to normal by 48 hours after challenge (data not shown). From the second day after challenge onward the temperature of all except the mock-challenged control mice began to decline. When we compared the magnitude of temperature depression from days 2-6 after challenge (during which time temperature change was due to influenza rather than VSV pathogenesis), the difference in temperature depression between mice immunized with rVSV HA and with VSV rwt was not statistically significant ( Figure 3C ). This supported the notion that mice immunized with the empty vector VSV rwt controlled infection as well as mice immunized with rVSV HA until the seventh day after challenge, but that after the seventh day antigen specific responses were required for survival and recovery. Mice vaccinated with either rVSV HA or VSV rwt lost significantly less temperature than those receiving diluent alone (P=0.0002 for rVSV HA and P=0.0066 for VSV rwt respectively, two-tailed Student t test, Figure 3C ), consistent with the idea that a non-specific anti-viral response induced by rVSV vaccination protected mice from pathology up until the seventh day after challenge.\r\n To confirm the results of the first study, and to begin to elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for protection elicited by vaccination, we challenged and immunized a second larger cohort of mice (n=30 per group) as shown in Figure 4 . We also included a cohort of mice (n=5) which were immunized with rVSV HA alone, and were not challenged with influenza, to allow us to measure the immune responses to both viruses alone. Seven mice from each group were followed for 14 days to monitor weight loss and survival, and the remainder of each group was sacrificed to perform immune response assays. As shown in Figure 4A , all (7\/7) rVSV HA vaccinated mice survived, and the rate of survival of mice immunized with rVSV HA was significantly higher than the rate of survival of mock-immunized mice (no VSV, P=0.0078, Mantel-Cox test) or of mice immunized with empty vector VSV rwt (VSV rwt, P=0.0217, Mantel Cox test). Three of the seven mice immunized with the empty vector VSV rwt survived, but as in the first experiment the rate of survival in VSV rwt immunized animals was not significantly different from that of mock-immunized mice (P=0.192, Mantel-Cox test). Weight loss of mice challenged with influenza and immunized with rVSV HA was similar to that of mice challenged with influenza and immunized with the empty vector until the seventh day after challenge, after which time mice immunized with the empty vector lost weight rapidly and mice immunized with rVSV HA recovered ( Figure 4B ). Mice immunized with rVSV HA but not challenged with influenza (n=5, open diamonds, Figure 4B ) had an initial weight loss of approximately 10-15% (between days 1 and 2) which was not observed in mice not receiving VSV. This confirmed that initial weight loss was due to VSV and not influenza pathogenesis. Interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) reduces pathology during acute influenza infection in humans and some laboratory animals, when produced naturally as a result of viral infection, or provided exogenously [32] [33] [34] . The role of IFN-\u03b1 in protection of inbred mice from influenza is indirect, since many mouse strains (including Balb\/C) express a non-functional allele of the interferon responsive gene Mx [35] . Functional Mx directly inhibits transcription of the influenza genome, reducing viral titers in Mx-intact mice [36] . In Mx-deficient inbred mice, IFN-\u03b1 by moderates the severe pulmonary immunopathology resulting from influenza infection, and promotes antibody class-switching to IgG2a isotype [37] . To determine whether rVSV immunization induced IFN-\u03b1 production in immunized mice we collected serum from vaccinees (4 mice per group) at 12, 24, and 48 hours after challenge\/vaccination and measured the amount of IFN-\u03b1 by ELISA. We also measured IFN-\u03b1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and in whole lung homogenates at 24 hours after challenge\/vaccination. No IFN-\u03b1 was detected in the BAL or lung homogenates in any of the challenged\/vaccinated mice. In the serum, IFN-\u03b1 was detected by 12 hours after challenge in all rVSV vaccinated mice (data not shown), peaked at 24 hours, and was no longer detectable by 48 hours after challenge. As shown in Figure 4C , IFN-\u03b1 was detected in the serum of mice immunized with rVSV HA or with VSV rwt, but not in the serum of mice challenged with influenza and immunized with diluent alone (No VSV group, Figure 4C ). The amount of IFN-\u03b1 in the serum of mice immunized with rVSV HA was not significantly different than the amount of IFN-\u03b1 in the serum of mice immunized with the empty vector VSV rwt (P=0.0558, Student t test). This result supported the idea that both rVSV vectors induced non-specific antiviral responses which were able to protect vaccinees until the seventh day after challenge\/immunization. The amount of IFN-\u03b1 in the serum of mice immunized with the rVSV HA vector alone, in the absence of flu challenge (rVSV HA only group, Figure 4C ) was not significantly different to that induced by rVSV HA in the presence of flu, which further supported the idea that IFN-\u03b1 was produced in response to the rVSV rather than influenza.\r\n Using the same cohorts of mice shown in Figure 4 , we performed the assay shown in Figure  5 to begin to determine the mechanism of vaccine action. We sacrificed four mice per group per day at the timepoints shown in Figure 5 and determined the titer of influenza and VSV (where applicable) by plaque assay on MDCK and BHK-21 cells respectively. No infectious VSV was recovered from the lung of any VSV-immunized animal at any timepoint tested (day 2-day 10 post challenge). This demonstrated that rVSV delivered intramuscularly did not disseminate to the lung and meant that the VSV vaccine viruses probably did not interfere directly with the ability of influenza to infect host cells. Pulmonary influenza titers peaked in all mice by four days after challenge ( Figure 5 ). Viral loads of mice immunized with either of the rVSV vectors were similar to the viral loads of mice receiving no VSV for the first six days after challenge, suggesting that the non-specific immune responses induced by rVSV immunization in the first six days after challenge did not directly limit viral replication. The pulmonary viral loads of mice immunized with rVSV HA and VSV rwt were not significantly different until the sixth day after challenge, after which time the viral loads of rVSV HA immunized mice declined rapidly while the viral loads of VSV rwt immunized mice remained significantly higher. Specifically, beginning on the eighth day after challenge (indicated by asterisks on the graph, Figure 5 ) the average pulmonary viral load of mice vaccinated with rVSV HA was significantly lower than the average viral load of control mice vaccinated with the empty vector VSV rwt (P<0.05 via one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison test). This result was consistent with the idea that non-specific responses provided equal protection to mice immunized with the specific and empty vector until the sixth day after challenge, and suggested that the specific response required for vaccine efficacy from the seventh day onward directly lowered the pulmonary viral load (induction of CTL, e.g.) of mice vaccinated with rVSV HA.\r\n When mice are intranasally infected with influenza CD8 T cells are primed and activated in the mediastinal lymph node 3-4 days later [38] . By 5-7 days after infection antigen-specific CD8 T cells are present in the lung and airway epithelium [39] where they facilitate viral clearance via perforin and granzyme mediated killing of infected epithelial cells [40] . To determine whether the kinetics or magnitude of CD8 T cell induction differed between vaccinated and non-vaccinated mice in our system we used an MHC Class I tetramer recognizing the H-2K d restricted epitope HA 533-541 (N-IYSTVASSL-C) to quantitate HAspecific CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood and lung of vaccinated and control mice. Representative FACS plots from the blood and lung of flu challenged mice are shown in Figure  6A and 6B respectively. In mice challenged with influenza and immunized with rVSV HA, we detected HA-specific CD8 T cells in the blood three days earlier (day 5 vs. day 8, Figure  6C ) in rVSV HA vaccinated mice vs. sham-vaccinated or VSV rwt vaccinated animals. When we measured anti-HA T cell responses in the lung we observed a similar pattern, with rVSV HA immunized mice having significantly greater percentages of HA-specific CD8 T cells than sham inoculated mice or mice vaccinated with the empty vector VSV rwt at all time points tested (P<0.05 for all comparisons via one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison test, Figure 6D ). In the peripheral blood the induction of anti-HA CD8 T cells was synergistic in mice challenged with influenza and immunized with rVSV HA, with CD8 T cell responses in rVSV HA vaccinated animals being significantly greater from day 14 after challenge\/ vaccination onward compared to that of mice challenged with influenza or vaccinated with the rVSV HA alone. The induction of anti-HA CD8 T cells immediately preceded recovery from challenge in vaccinees. To test whether CD8 T cells were necessary for vaccine mediated protection we used a monoclonal antibody reactive against murine CD8\u03b1 to deplete a cohort of vaccinees (n=10, open squares, Figure 6E ) of CD8 T cells prior to challenge\/vaccination with rVSV HA. The depletion protocol resulted in complete (>95%) removal of CD8 T cells from the lung, spleen, and peripheral blood which was confirmed by flow cytometry on day 0 and day 14 of the experiment (data not shown). All CD8-depleted mice survived challenge, and weight loss in CD8 depleted animals vaccinated with rVSV HA was not significantly different than weight loss in CD8-intact animals vaccinated with rVSV HA. This demonstrated that CD8 T cells were not necessary for vaccine mediated protection in this challenge and vaccination model, although it remains possible that CD8 T cells could enhance protection against heterologous challenge.\r\n Neutralizing antibody against influenza prevents attachment of the viral HA to the host cell, and the induction of neutralizing antibody is a major correlate of protection against human influenza infection. To determine whether immunization with rVSV HA was generating antiinfluenza neutralizing antibody in vaccinated mice we collected serum from rVSV HA vaccinated and control animals over a timecourse and detected neutralizing antibodies against the PR8 challenge virus via microneutralization assay. We collected serum from 3 animals per group on days 4,6, 8, and 10 after challenge\/vaccination. As shown in Figure 7 , mice challenged with influenza and vaccinated with rVSV HA (open triangles) developed anti-influenza neutralizing antibodies by the sixth day after challenge\/immunization. Mice vaccinated with rVSV HA in the absence of flu challenge (Figure 7 , open diamonds) also developed neutralizing antibody by six days after immunization, which demonstrated that co-infection with flu did not positively or negatively affect the speed with which serum neutralizing antibody was induced by the rVSV HA. Sham-immunized (No VSV) and empty vector immunized mice did not have detectable serum neutralizing antibody until day 8 and 10 (respectively) after challenge. This result was consistent with the decline in viral titers beginning on day 8, in mice immunized with rVSV HA, and suggested that the induction of neutralizing antibodies may have contributed to protection. In surviving animals neutralizing titers increased during the recovery phase of infection to average titers of 1:80 by three months after challenge (data not shown). These results were consistent with the finding that viral loads were reduced in rVSV HA vaccinated versus control mice, and suggested that since rVSV HA vaccinated animals developed neutralizing antibody more quickly than mock or empty vector immunized mice, it is likely that the induction of serum neutralizing Ab contributed to protection induced by rVSV HA vaccination.\r\n To determine how long after challenge we could delay rVSV HA immunization and retain protection we performed the experiment shown in Figure 8 . As in the first experiment, Balb\/ C mice (n=7-10 mice per group) were challenged with 100MLD 50 PR8 influenza in a total volume of 40\u03bcl. Mice were then immunized immediately with either rVSV HA or with VSV rwt (n=7 per group) as in Figure 3 . We included additional groups (n=10 per group) of mice which were immunized with rVSV HA at either 12 or 24 hours after challenge. All mice immunized with rVSV HA at 0, 12, or 24 hours after challenge survived, although weight loss in the mice immunized at 24 hours was more severe and prolonged than in mice receiving the vaccine at earlier timepoints ( Figure 8 ). This demonstrated that rVSV HA vaccination could be delayed by up to 24 hours after challenge and retain efficacy.\r\n We undertook this study to determine whether immunization with rVSV HA could protect mice from lethal influenza challenge when the vaccine virus was delivered systemically after lethal intranasal influenza challenge. We demonstrated that 100% of mice immunized with the rVSV HA specific vector, and up to 40% of mice receiving the control empty vector VSV rwt were protected from mortality. Administration of the rVSV HA vector could be delayed for up to 24 hours after challenge with full retention of protection, showing that post-exposure vaccination against influenza was feasible and potentially translatable to use in emergent situations. The main question arising from these results is what the mechanism(s) of vaccine induced protection were. Up to 40% of mice immunized with the empty vector survived challenge, which suggested that protection was partially mediated by non-specific factors. However, the rate of survival was significantly higher in mice vaccinated with the specific vector (rVSV HA, 100% survival), which showed that specific responses were required for complete and optimal protection. With this in mind, several mechanisms of vaccine action can be considered, either alone or in combination. First, the rVSV vaccine virus could have directly interfered with the ability of influenza to infect host cells. Our data did not support this possibility for two reasons. First, rVSV HA and VSV rwt would be expected to compete equally well with influenza for host cell binding, since both VSV viruses infect via the VSV G attachment protein. Mice immunized with VSV rwt had a significantly lower rate of survival than rVSV HA immunized mice, which demonstrated that the mechanism of protection was not induced equally by the two rVSVs. Second, the influenza challenge virus was delivered intranasally, and the rVSV viruses were delivered intramuscularly at a distal site (rear quadriceps). When we titered infectious virus from lung homogenates of co-infected\/ vaccinated mice, we confirmed that no infectious VSV was present in the lung of mice challenged with influenza and immunized with either rVSV HA or VSV rwt. This showed that VSV did not disseminate to the lung of vaccinated mice, and since influenza virus was restricted to the lung in our model, it was therefore not likely that the VSV vaccine viruses interfered directly with the ability of influenza to infect host cells. Consistent with these results, viral loads of control and rVSV vaccinated mice did not differ substantially at the earliest timepoints examined (days 2-4 after challenge) which suggested that the influenza virus was able to replicate equally well in vaccinated and control mice until the adaptive response was mounted, and added further evidence that direct viral interference was not an important mechanism of protection in our model.\r\n A second possible mechanism of vaccine action was that the rVSV vaccine could have induced non-specific innate antiviral responses which promoted the induction of adaptive responses and\/or inhibited the ability of influenza to replicate and\/or cause pathology. Non-specific innate immune responses theoretically would be induced equally by the rVSV HA specific vector and the VSV rwt empty vector. The induction of type-I IFNs such as IFN-\u03b1\/\u03b2 is part of the earliest innate host response to viral infection. Because the Balb\/c mice used in these studies are naturally deficient in the IFN-inducible gene Mx [35, 36] , which inhibits primary transcription of the influenza A virus genome [41] , the role of IFN-\u03b1 in our model is likely to be indirect, rather than direct. Consistent with this idea, we did not detect IFN-\u03b1 in the lung of vaccinated\/ challenged mice, and viral loads were not significantly lower in rVSV versus control mice during the time that IFN was detected. These results supported the idea that the IFN-\u03b1 induced by VSV did not inhibit influenza virus replication directly but rather that systemic IFN-\u03b1 enhanced the development of the adaptive immune responses and\/or moderated immunopathology induced by influenza infection. In support of this idea, it has been reported that provision of exogenous IFN-\u03b1 can protect inbred Mx-deficient mice from influenza infection, even when delivered parenterally [32] . Stat1 \u2212\/\u2212 mice, which are unable to respond to IFN-\u03b1, are significantly more susceptible to influenza infection than wild type control mice [42] . Stat1 \u2212\/\u2212 mice control influenza virus replication as well as wild type mice, but have uncontrolled pulmonary immunopathology and reduced anti-influenza humoral responses which lead to a higher rate of mortality relative Stat-intact animals [37] . Finally, it has been reported that the IFN-\u03b1\/\u03b2 induced by rVSV infection significantly augments the development of antiviral neutralizing antibody by plasma cells expressing the IFN-\u03b1\/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR) [43] . Directly confirming that IFN-\u03b1 contributes to protection in our model will not be straightforward, since mice that are unable to respond to interferon (IFNAR\u2212\/\u2212) are highly susceptible to low dose VSV infection [44] and would undoubtedly be killed by the high doses of rVSV vaccine viruses used in our studies. Nonetheless, the observation that mice immunized with rVSV HA had more rapid induction of neutralizing antibody than control animals, and that mice immunized with either rVSV HA or VSV rwt had significantly less morbidity (weight loss, temperature depression) than control mice during the first six days after infection are consistent with the idea that innate immune responses made by both groups were superior to those mounted by control mice during the early phase of infection. It is very likely that multiple cytokines were induced by rVSV immunization (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 e.g.) and contributed to protection in our model. Further studies to define the specific cytokine responses induced by rVSV vaccination and which are required for vaccine-mediated protection are necessary.\r\n It was also possible that rVSV vectors could have induced specific cellular or humoral responses against influenza which \"outcompeted\" the influenza virus. Our results showed a clear temporal separation in adaptive immune responses induced by influenza infection alone (No VSV mock vaccinated control mice) versus those induced by rVSV HA vaccination in the presence or absence of influenza challenge. Mice challenged with influenza and vaccinated with rVSV HA developed anti-HA CD8 T cells two to three days earlier (in the peripheral blood), and had anti-HA CD8 T cell responses of significantly greater magnitude in the lung, than did control mock-vaccinated mice, or those vaccinated with the empty vector. Mice receiving rVSV HA alone (without flu) also had detectable anti-HA T cells in the peripheral blood by 5 days after immunization. These results demonstrated that vaccination with rVSV HA resulted in more rapid induction of anti-HA CD8 T cells, and that the presence of influenza did not affect (either positively or negatively) the speed with which the T cells were induced in response to rVSV HA, although the magnitude of the response was slightly reduced in coinfected mice in the early stage of infection, versus those immunized with rVSV HA in the absence of flu. Despite the vigorous induction of HA-specific CD8 T cells in the lung and periphery of rVSV HA vaccinated mice, depletion of CD8 T cells in these animals did not increase morbidity, delay recovery, or reduce survival. This demonstrated that CD8 T cells were not essential to protection in our model, although it does not preclude the possibility that CD8 T cells (especially those directed against conserved antigens) might contribute to protection against heterologous challenge viruses. Interestingly, the induction of anti-HA CD8 T cells in mice challenged with influenza and vaccinated with rVSV HA was markedly synergistic from two weeks after challenge onward (through day 70 after challenge), with coinfected mice having responses of significantly higher magnitude than mice infected with either virus alone. The synergistic effect was not present in mice challenged with flu and immunized with the rVSV empty vector, suggesting that the synergy was not due simply to a non-specific \"adjuvant\" effect of VSV. Dissecting the reason for the observed synergy and determining the effect of co-infection with rVSV HA and flu on long term memory T cell responses will be an important area for further investigation. Mice challenged with influenza and vaccinated with rVSV HA had detectable serum neutralizing antibody against influenza two days earlier (Day 6 vs. Day 8) than control mice. Neutralizing antibody correlates with protection from influenza in humans and animals, and is assumed to be the primary mechanism by which existing influenza vaccines mediate protection in human vaccinees. We predict that the induction of neutralizing antibody is crucial to protection by our vaccine, and further studies in which B cells are depleted at specific timepoints after vaccination\/challenge will be required to confirm that hypothesis. Our data do not exclude the possibility that vaccination with rVSV HA or VSV rwt altered the overall pulmonary or systemic cytokine milieu in challenged and vaccinated animals. The elaboration of inflammatory cytokines is a major source of pathology in influenza infection, and it is possible that the presence of the vaccine virus reduced or altered the inflammatory response in a beneficial manner. Detailed analysis of the pulmonary and systemic cytokine response to rVSV immunization in the context of pre-existing flu infection is an important future direction.\r\n Our results are consistent with a model (diagrammed in Figure 9 ) in which both rVSV HA and VSV rwt rapidly induce non-specific antiviral responses which protect vaccinees equally until approximately day 6-7 after challenge. We predict that the reason mice receiving the empty vector are not equally protected from day 6-7 after challenge onward is because they do not make antigen specific responses to influenza. Our data further suggest that neutralizing antibody reduces pulmonary viral loads in mice receiving the rVSV HA, and that the clearance of influenza virus infected cells may be aided by, but is not absolutely dependent upon, the action of HA-specific CTL. It will be important to establish, in future studies, the maximum length of time that rVSV HA vaccination can be delayed while retaining full protection. In these studies, when the rVSV vaccine was delivered immediately after challenge the mock immunized control mice died between days 8-10 after challenge. In rVSV PR8 HA vaccinated mice we detected CD8 T cell responses at Day 5 and neutralizing antibody responses at Day 6 after challenge. If delaying the rVSV immunization delays development of immune responses proportionally, then we do not anticipate being able to delay rVSV PR8 HA immunization by more than 2 days after challenge to retain protection.\r\n In summary, these results demonstrate that vaccination with rVSV HA can protect mice from lethal influenza challenge when the vaccine virus is delivered systemically up to 24 hours after challenge. Further experiments to precisely define the mechanism(s), both specific and nonspecific, which contribute to vaccine efficacy are necessary, and will further not only optimization of the vaccine design, but our understanding of the fine differences between the host response to viral antigens in their natural context, versus the response to a viral vectored vaccine. It will also be important to compare, in \"head to head\" studies, the efficacy of existing influenza vaccines, used therapeutically, to our rVSV HA vaccine used therapeutically. Finally, the addition of rVSV expressing conserved influenza antigens to our vaccine may broaden efficacy such that protection against highly pathogenic avian or other and newly emerging influenza strains could be achieved. Adult female Balb\/C mice were challenged intranasally with 100MLD 50 PR8. Immediately (within 1-2 minutes) after influenza challenge, mice were either intramuscularly shaminoculated with diluent alone (n=10), immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV empty vector (VSV rwt, n=5), or immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV HA (n=10). Mice were monitored for survival and weight loss (Panels A and B), and change in body temperature (Panel C). Mice were humanely euthanized when their body weight reached 75% of preinfection body weight for two consecutive days. rVSV HA immunized mice had a significantly higher rate of survival than mice receiving no VSV (P=0.0012, Mantel-Cox test) or vaccinated with the empty vector VSV rwt (P=0.0082, Mantel-Cox test). This experiment has been performed a total of four times with consistent results.\r\n Adult female Balb\/C mice were challenged intranasally with 100MLD 50 PR8. Immediately (within 1-2 minutes) after influenza challenge, mice were either intramuscularly shaminoculated with diluent alone (n=7), immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV empty vector (VSV rwt, n=7), or immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV HA (n=7). Five additional mice were mock-challenged with PBS alone and then immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV HA. Mice were monitored for survival (Panel A) and weight loss (Panel B), and induction of IFN-\u03b1 in the serum (Panel C). Mice were humanely euthanized when their body weight reached 75% of pre-infection body weight for two consecutive days. Mice challenged with flu and immunized with rVSV HA had a significantly higher rate of survival than mice receiving no VSV (P=0.0078, Mantel-Cox test) or vaccinated with the empty vector VSV rwt (P=0.0217, Mantel-Cox test). Graph in Panel C shows concentration of IFN-\u03b1 in pg\/ ml in the individually assayed 24 hr timepoint sera of vaccinated and control mice (n=4-5 per group) as measured by ELISA. The amount of IFN-\u03b1 induced in mice immunized with the empty vector VSV rwt was not significantly different than the amount of IFN-\u03b1 induced in mice immunized with the specific vector rVSV HA.\r\n Adult female Balb\/C mice were challenged intranasally with 100MLD 50 PR8. Immediately (within 1-2 minutes) after influenza challenge, were either intramuscularly sham-inoculated with diluent alone, immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV empty vector, or immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV HA. At the timepoints shown four mice per group were sacrificed and the amount of influenza and\/or rVSV in the lung determined by plaque assay. No infectious VSV was detected in the lungs of any mice at any time. Graph shows average pulmonary viral load (influenza) for each group in PFU\/g. Beginning on the eighth day after challenge (indicated by asterisk on the graph) the average pulmonary viral load of mice vaccinated with rVSV HA was significantly lower than the average viral load of control mice vaccinated with the empty vector VSV rwt (P<0.05 via one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison test). Adult female Balb\/C mice were challenged intranasally with 100MLD 50 PR8. Immediately (within 1-2 minutes) after influenza challenge, mice were either intramuscularly shaminoculated with diluent alone (n=7), immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV empty vector (VSVrwt, n=7), or immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV HA (n=7). Five additional mice were mock-challenged with PBS alone and then immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV HA. Panels A and B show representative FACS plots of tetramer staining of lymphocytes isolated from the peripheral blood (Panel A) or whole lung (Panel B) of challenged and rVSV HA vaccinated mice isolated on the sixth day after immunization\/ challenge. Panels C and D show a timecourse of anti-HA CD8 T cell responses in the peripheral blood (Panel C) and whole lung (Panel D) of vaccinated animals (n=at least 4 mice per group per day analyzed individually). Bars on the graph represent average percent of CD8 T cells binding an MHC Class I tetramer specific for the K d restricted HA 533-541 epitope \u00b1SEM for each immunization group. Asterisks above the bars represent days on which the mice challenged with influenza and vaccinated with rVSV HA had significantly more anti-HA specific CD8 T cells than mice challenged with influenza and vaccinated with the empty vector or challenged with influenza and sham vaccinated with diluent alone (P<0.05 via ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison test). Panel E shows the outcome of challenge vaccination in mice depleted of CD8 T cells (n=10, open squares). All CD8 T cell depleted mice survived, and the course of weight loss was not significantly different than that observed in CD8 T cell intact mice. This experiment (CD8 depletion) has been performed three times with consistent results. Adult female Balb\/C mice were challenged intranasally with 100MLD 50 PR8. Immediately (within 1-2 minutes) after influenza challenge, mice were either intramuscularly shaminoculated with diluent alone (n=7), immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV empty vector (VSV rwt, n=7), or immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV HA (n=7). Five additional mice were mock-challenged with PBS alone and then immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV HA. Graph shows serum neutralizing titers measured by microneutralization assay using pooled serum samples from at least 4 vaccinated or control animals for each timepoint. At day six after challenge only mice vaccinated with rVSV HA had detectable titers (indicated by arrow on graph). Data shown is from a single experiment which has been performed a total of three times with consistent results. Adult female Balb\/C mice were challenged intranasally with 100MLD 50 PR8.

In emergent circumstances however, prophylactic vaccination is often impractical or ineffective. FluMist also contains two influenza A and one influenza B strains. Both types of influenza vaccine are administered prior to the circulation of influenza virus in a community, allowing time for protective immunity to develop before individuals are likely to encounter influenza virus naturally. In addition, a recent series of reports demonstrated that an rVSV expressing the Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein could protect macaques from lethal EBOV challenge when administered within 20 minutes after EBOV challenge and when the challenge and vaccine viruses were delivered by the same route [21] [22] [23] [24] . We undertook the present study to determine whether a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the hemagglutinin (rVSV HA) of influenza A\/PR\/8\/34 (PR8) could protect animals from influenza challenge when administered after exposure to influenza had occurred. The forward primer introduced a Sal I site upstream of the coding sequence and the reverse primer introduced an Nhe I site. Plasmids were recovered after transformation of E. coli and purified using a Maxi kit (QIAGEN) and the insert sequences verified (Duke Sequencing Facility). While pBS-G is not required for recovery of recombinants, it was included to enhance efficiency. BHK cells (10 6 ) were infected at an MOI of 20 with VSV recombinant or control virus. After 5 hrs, medium was removed and cells were washed twice with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Medium was removed, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed with 500 \u03bcl of detergent solution (1%Nonidet P-40, 0.4% deoxycholate, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 62.5 mM EDTA) on ice for 5 min, and collected into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Protein extracts were fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 15% acrylamide), and proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Eight to ten-week-old female Balb\/C mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and housed for at least 1 week before experiments were initiated. Mice were housed in microisolator cages in a biosafety level 2-equipped animal facility. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Duke University approved all animal experiments. with 1mg\/mouse of a monoclonal antibody (Clone YTS 169AG 101HL) reactive against CD8\u03b1. Mice received injections on day \u22123, day \u22121, and day +6 after challenge. To obtain peripheral blood lymphocytes blood was collected into serum free medium (DMEM) containing heparin. Blood was layered onto a Ficoll gradient and spun, after which lymphocytes were collected from the interface. Cells were washed and resuspended in DMEM containing 5% FCS. To obtain lymphocytes from the lung, mice were sacrificed via anesthetic overdose and lungs aseptically removed. Staining was performed on freshly isolated lymphocytes as previously described [26] . Briefly, approximately 5\u00d710 6 cells were added to the wells of a 96-well V-bottom plate and were blocked with unconjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes) and F c block (Pharmingen) for 15 min at room temperature (RT). Shaminoculated control animals were used to determine background levels of tetramer binding. Background was routinely less than 0.1% and was subtracted from all reported percentages. Heat-inactivated serum from immunized or control animals was serially diluted and incubated with virus for one hour at RT. Infectivity was defined by presence of cpe on day four post infection. Another aliquot was titered on BHK-21 cells to detect infectious VSV. All statistical tests were performed using Graph Pad Prism statistical analysis software. Results were considered significant when P<0.05 was reached. Specific analyses used are indicated in the text and figure legends. Surface expression of HA on the surface of infected cells was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining of cells infected with the recombinant ( Figure 1C ). As shown in Figure 2 the recombinant virus (rVSV HA) grew to equivalent titers as the parent virus (VSV rwt), indicating that the expression of influenza HA does not attenuate rVSV HA in vitro. To determine whether rVSV HA protected mice from morbidity and mortality when rVSV HA was delivered after influenza challenge we performed the experiment shown in Figure 3 . This suggested that the VSV rwt empty vector conferred partial protection, but that specific responses were ultimately required for complete protection. Consistent with this idea, the weight loss pattern of mice vaccinated with rVSV HA diverged significantly from that of mice vaccinated with empty vector VSV rwt from the seventh day after challenge onward, with rVSV HA immunized mice recovering more rapidly ( Figure 3B ) than those immunized with VSV rwt. As shown in Figure 4A , all (7\/7) rVSV HA vaccinated mice survived, and the rate of survival of mice immunized with rVSV HA was significantly higher than the rate of survival of mock-immunized mice (no VSV, P=0.0078, Mantel-Cox test) or of mice immunized with empty vector VSV rwt (VSV rwt, P=0.0217, Mantel Cox test). Mice immunized with rVSV HA but not challenged with influenza (n=5, open diamonds, Figure 4B ) had an initial weight loss of approximately 10-15% (between days 1 and 2) which was not observed in mice not receiving VSV. This confirmed that initial weight loss was due to VSV and not influenza pathogenesis. We sacrificed four mice per group per day at the timepoints shown in Figure 5 and determined the titer of influenza and VSV (where applicable) by plaque assay on MDCK and BHK-21 cells respectively. To determine whether the kinetics or magnitude of CD8 T cell induction differed between vaccinated and non-vaccinated mice in our system we used an MHC Class I tetramer recognizing the H-2K d restricted epitope HA 533-541 (N-IYSTVASSL-C) to quantitate HAspecific CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood and lung of vaccinated and control mice. In the peripheral blood the induction of anti-HA CD8 T cells was synergistic in mice challenged with influenza and immunized with rVSV HA, with CD8 T cell responses in rVSV HA vaccinated animals being significantly greater from day 14 after challenge\/ vaccination onward compared to that of mice challenged with influenza or vaccinated with the rVSV HA alone. To test whether CD8 T cells were necessary for vaccine mediated protection we used a monoclonal antibody reactive against murine CD8\u03b1 to deplete a cohort of vaccinees (n=10, open squares, Figure 6E ) of CD8 T cells prior to challenge\/vaccination with rVSV HA. As shown in Figure 7 , mice challenged with influenza and vaccinated with rVSV HA (open triangles) developed anti-influenza neutralizing antibodies by the sixth day after challenge\/immunization. As in the first experiment, Balb\/ C mice (n=7-10 mice per group) were challenged with 100MLD 50 PR8 influenza in a total volume of 40\u03bcl. Administration of the rVSV HA vector could be delayed for up to 24 hours after challenge with full retention of protection, showing that post-exposure vaccination against influenza was feasible and potentially translatable to use in emergent situations. The main question arising from these results is what the mechanism(s) of vaccine induced protection were. Our data did not support this possibility for two reasons. Consistent with these results, viral loads of control and rVSV vaccinated mice did not differ substantially at the earliest timepoints examined (days 2-4 after challenge) which suggested that the influenza virus was able to replicate equally well in vaccinated and control mice until the adaptive response was mounted, and added further evidence that direct viral interference was not an important mechanism of protection in our model. Because the Balb\/c mice used in these studies are naturally deficient in the IFN-inducible gene Mx [35, 36] , which inhibits primary transcription of the influenza A virus genome [41] , the role of IFN-\u03b1 in our model is likely to be indirect, rather than direct. Stat1 \u2212\/\u2212 mice control influenza virus replication as well as wild type mice, but have uncontrolled pulmonary immunopathology and reduced anti-influenza humoral responses which lead to a higher rate of mortality relative Stat-intact animals [37] . Neutralizing antibody correlates with protection from influenza in humans and animals, and is assumed to be the primary mechanism by which existing influenza vaccines mediate protection in human vaccinees. In these studies, when the rVSV vaccine was delivered immediately after challenge the mock immunized control mice died between days 8-10 after challenge. Further experiments to precisely define the mechanism(s), both specific and nonspecific, which contribute to vaccine efficacy are necessary, and will further not only optimization of the vaccine design, but our understanding of the fine differences between the host response to viral antigens in their natural context, versus the response to a viral vectored vaccine. Adult female Balb\/C mice were challenged intranasally with 100MLD 50 PR8. Mice were monitored for survival and weight loss (Panels A and B), and change in body temperature (Panel C). Mice were humanely euthanized when their body weight reached 75% of preinfection body weight for two consecutive days. This experiment has been performed a total of four times with consistent results. Immediately (within 1-2 minutes) after influenza challenge, mice were either intramuscularly shaminoculated with diluent alone (n=7), immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV empty vector (VSV rwt, n=7), or immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV HA (n=7). Five additional mice were mock-challenged with PBS alone and then immunized intramuscularly with 5\u00d710 8 PFU rVSV HA. No infectious VSV was detected in the lungs of any mice at any time. Graph shows average pulmonary viral load (influenza) for each group in PFU\/g. Beginning on the eighth day after challenge (indicated by asterisk on the graph) the average pulmonary viral load of mice vaccinated with rVSV HA was significantly lower than the average viral load of control mice vaccinated with the empty vector VSV rwt (P<0.05 via one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison test). Panels C and D show a timecourse of anti-HA CD8 T cell responses in the peripheral blood (Panel C) and whole lung (Panel D) of vaccinated animals (n=at least 4 mice per group per day analyzed individually).

Data were used from a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial into the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination in which smoking status was measured 10 weeks after the start of the trial. A total of 1838 subjects aged 60 years or older, of whom 1531 subjects (321 smokers, 1152 non-smokers and 58 cigar\/pipe smokers) who returned the smoking questionnaire and were not previously vaccinated, were used in the analyses. The main outcome measures were serological in\u00afuenza (fourfold increase of antibody titre between 3 weeks and 5 months after vaccination); clinical in\u00afuenza as determined by criteria of the Dutch Sentinel Stations from self reported symptoms in postal questionnaires 10 weeks and 5 months after vaccination; increases after vaccination and decreases after 5 months in logarithmic titres of antibody against the vaccine strains. No relation between smoking and either serological or clinical in\u00afuenza was found, although the risk for serological in\u00afuenza was slightly (not signi\u00aecantly) elevated in smokers compared to non-smokers. A statistical interaction was found between smoking and vaccination when serological in\u00afuenza was the outcome measure indicating that the ecacy of vaccination was greater in smokers than in non-smokers (comparison of model with and without interaction; likelihood ratio test, p < 0.0001). This \u00aending is supported by a greater titre rise 3 weeks after vaccination for two out of four strains, but not by the antibody response after vaccination in previous studies on in\u00afuenza and other infectious diseases. Also, this possible dierence of immunogenicity is not re\u00afected in a better protection for clinical in\u00afuenza. The rise in antibody titre 3 weeks after vaccination was higher in smokers for A\/Singapore\/6\/86 and B\/Beijing\/11\/87, but not for the other two strains. Decline in titres after 5 months was similar for smokers and non-smokers. We conclude that smoking has no clinical or preventive signi\u00aecance for risk of in\u00afuenza in the elderly. #","text_body":"Some studies found smokers to be more susceptible to in\u00afuenza compared to non-smokers [1\u00b13] . These studies were held among healthy young men [1, 2] and among a general population with a mean age of 44 years [3, 4] . Since 95% of the deaths due to in\u00afuenza occur among people aged 60 years and older [5] , we focused on the eect of smoking on in\u00afuenza and on the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination in this age group.\r\n Morbidity after in\u00afuenza vaccination in the elderly was signi\u00aecantly reduced in cohort studies and in a randomized controlled trial [6, 7] . It is unknown if smoking in this group in\u00afuences the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination.\r\n The antibody response that follows immunization with in\u00afuenza vaccine is similar in smokers and non smokers during the \u00aerst three months [8] , but shows a greater decline in antibody titres after one year in smokers [3, 9] . The impaired persistence of serum antibody in smokers after immunization with in\u00afuenza vaccine could in\u00afuence the ecacy of the vaccine in preventing in\u00afuenza.\r\n The objective of this study is to examine the relation between cigarette smoking and (1) the occurrence of in\u00afuenza, (2) the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination and (3) the antibody response to in\u00afuenza vaccination. The data for this study were derived from a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination in elderly individuals [7] . We analyzed the eect of smoking on in\u00afuenza risk, the eect of smoking on vaccine ecacy with clinical as well as serological outcomes and the eect of smoking on the antibody response to vaccination after 3 weeks (rate of increase) and 5 months (rate of decline).\r\n In the winter of 1991\u00b11992 a randomized clinical trial of the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination in the elderly was conducted, involving 31 general practitioners in 15 practices in South-Limburg, the Netherlands. Persons aged 60 or more were invited to participate if they did not belong to those high-risk groups in which vaccination was recommended (in the Netherlands age was no criterion for recommendation at that time) [10] . A total of 1838 patients agreed to participate. This group contained 490 patients with heart conditions, lung conditions, or diabetes mellitus who were not considered to belong to the high-risk groups by their general practitioner. The analysis was restricted to subjects not previously vaccinated. Details about the recruiting of patients have been described previously [7] .\r\n The protocol was approved by the medical ethics committee of the University of Limburg and the University Hospital, Maastricht, the Netherlands. Informed consent was obtained and forms were signed by all participants.\r\n The research period covered \u00aeve months (November 1991 until April 1992 . Patients were vaccinated with 0.5 ml of puri\u00aeed split-virion vaccine (n = 927, A\/ Singapore\/6\/86 (H1N1), A\/Beijing\/353\/89 (H3N2), B\/ Panama\/45\/90 and B\/Beijing\/1\/87 (each strain with 15 mg of hemagglutinin)) or intramuscular placebo (n = 911, physiological saline solution) according to a randomization protocol. Between November 1 and 15, 1991, 9 ml of venous blood was taken from all participants (pre-titre) before vaccine or placebo was injected. Three weeks later a second blood sample was taken (post-titre). At the end of the follow up, 5 months after vaccination, a \u00aenal blood sample was taken (endtitre).\r\n A total of 223 patients indicated to have been vaccinated previously in 1989 and\/or 1990.\r\n A questionnaire on smoking habits was sent to all participants 10 weeks after the start of the investigation. A total of 1756 subjects (96%) returned this questionnaire.\r\n The information gathered about smoking status comprised current smoking status, past smoking status, smoking of cigars, pipe or cigarettes and the amount of cigarettes smoked every day (1\u00b19 per day, 10\u00b119 per day, 20+ per day). Never-smokers and exsmokers were grouped as non-smokers, cigarette smokers as smokers, leaving a rest group. The rest group consisted of pipe and cigar smokers who did not smoke cigarettes currently or previously.\r\n The antibody titres to the in\u00afuenza strains in the vaccine were measured by means of the hemagglutinin inhibition test. The titres were expressed as the reciprocal values of dilution, of which 50% of hemagglutinin inhibition occurred after addition of 3 hemagglutinating units of antigen. Titres less than 9 were arbitrarily set to 5. The mean logarithmic titre value for the sera was calculated from the serum levels to ensure a normally distributed range of titre values used in the statistical analyses. The serum levels were independently measured by two analysts. This was done for all sera from all samples for each individual strain. Dierences in logarithmic titres were calculated for smokers compared to non-smokers. Increases in logarithmic titre values were calculated from pre-titre to post-titre and post-titre to end-titre.\r\n A titre of 38 or greater and a fourfold titre increase in end-titre relative to post-titre were taken as the criteria of serological in\u00afuenza infection [11] .\r\n A questionnaire regarding possible in\u00afuenza episodes and symptoms was sent to all participants 10 and 23 weeks after vaccination. Three criteria were used to diagnose clinical in\u00afuenza: in\u00afuenza according to the family physician, Dutch Sentinel Stations, and the International Classi\u00aecation of Health Problems in Primary Care (ICHPPC-2-de\u00aened). ICHPPC-2 de\u00aened in\u00afuenza is the least rigid criterion and may cause a false-positive diagnosis of in\u00afuenza for many patients [7] . In\u00afuenza according to the family physician could only be diagnosed if patients consulted the physician during the follow-up period, possibly missing patients with in\u00afuenza not visiting their physician. Criteria to diagnose clinical in\u00afuenza were therefore restricted to criteria of the Dutch Sentinel Stations in this analysis.\r\n These criteria include an acute onset of symptoms, fever of at least 388C measured rectally and at least one of the following symptoms: coughing, coryza, sore throat, frontal headache, retrosternal pain or myalgia [12] .\r\n A series of control variables was available to see if alternative explanations might exist for the relations of interest. These variables were age, sex, risk group, protective titre before vaccination and current vaccination status. Risk groups were categorized as heart conditions, lung conditions, diabetes mellitus and a group not having those conditions. A titre of 100 or greater for A strains and 200 or greater for B strains was considered to be a protective titre [13] .\r\n The group used for analysis consisted of 1756 \u00c0 225 (previously vaccinated) = 1531 subjects. In testing a possible relation between smoking and in\u00afuenza strati-\u00aecation by current vaccination status was applied. Data were analyzed separately for the vaccine and the placebo group. The relation between smoking and in\u00afuenza and the ecacy of vaccination in smokers and non-smokers was analyzed, using the odds ratio and the risk dierence. Con\u00aedence limits for the risk dierence were calculated using the formula for cumulative incidence data described by Rothman [14] . Logistic regression was used to correct for age, sex and risk group in the relation between smoking and in\u00afuenza and for age, sex, risk group and protective titre before vaccination in the analyses of vaccination ecacy in the two smoking groups. A trend in the incidence of in\u00afuenza over the smoking categories, non-smoker, 1\u00b19 a day (light smoker), 10\u00b119 a day (moderate smoker) and 20 or more a day (heavy smoker), was evaluated using regression analysis with controlling for age, sex and risk group.\r\n The dierence in vaccine ecacy between smokers and non-smokers was tested in a logistic regression analysis by evaluating interaction between vaccination and smoking, controlling for age, sex, risk group. This was done using the likelihood ratio test as described by Kleinbaum [15] .\r\n Antibody response was expressed as the mean change of the individual titre after vaccination (post-titre\u00b1pre-titre) and as the decline after 5 months (end-titre\u00b1post-titre). In analyzing the decline after 5 months subjects who had serological in\u00afuenza (4 fold titre increase) were excluded. Dierences in increases and declines between smokers and non-smokers were tested by t-test for independent groups and ANOVA for each strain controlling for age, sex and risk group. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study subjects, which consisted of 321 smokers, 1152 non-smokers and 58 pipe and\/or cigar smokers (rest). The smokers and non-smokers groups were similar with regard to current vaccination status, risk group and protective titre before vaccination. Younger subjects and male subjects were overrepresented among smokers. Serological data were incomplete for 31 participants in the trial population. Subjects with incomplete samples were retained in the analyses whenever possible. Table 2 shows the eect of smoking on serological and clinical in\u00afuenza in previously unvaccinated subjects and categorized by current vaccination status. No statistical signi\u00aecant dierences were found. In the placebo group, a higher rate of serological in\u00afuenza was found in smokers compared to non-smokers. However this dierence was not statistically signi\u00aecant and was not con\u00aermed in the vaccine group (even the reverse was true). The rate of clinical in\u00afuenza did not dier for smokers compared to non-smokers.\r\n The relation between smoking and in\u00afuenza was further analyzed by using a classi\u00aecation of non-smokers, light smokers (1\u00b19 cigarettes per day), moderate smokers (10\u00b119 per day) and heavy smokers (20 or more per day). The rate of serological in\u00afuenza in the vaccine group was 6% in non-smokers, 3% in light smokers, 3% in moderate smokers and 0% in heavy smokers (trend p = 0.10). In the placebo group serological in\u00afuenza increased from 9% in non-smokers to 11% in light smokers, 13% in moderate smokers and 15% in heavy smokers (trend p = 0.13). No trends were found for clinical in\u00afuenza. Table 3 shows the ecacy of vaccination in smokers and in non-smokers. The data do not con\u00aerm the hypothesis that smoking attenuates vaccine ecacy. Rather the reverse was true when serological in\u00afuenza was the outcome measure. Vaccinated smokers were more protected against serological in\u00afuenza (corrected OR = 0.17) than were vaccinated non-smokers (corrected OR = 0.71). This dierence in ecacy between smokers and non-smokers was statistically signi\u00aecant (likelihood ratio test p < 0.0001; corrected for age, sex and risk group). When clinical in\u00afuenza was the outcome measure no dierence in ecacy of vaccination was found between smokers and non-smokers (likelihood ratio test p = 0.46; corrected for age, sex and risk group). Table 4 shows the mean logarithmic titre change, from pre-titre to post-titre and from post-titre to endtitre, in the vaccine group for smokers compared with non-smokers. No great dierences were found in pretitres for smokers compared to non-smokers (adjusted for age, sex and risk group). The rise in titre after vaccination was statistically signi\u00aecantly higher in smokers for A\/Singapore\/6\/86 and B\/Beijing\/11\/87, but not for A\/Beijing\/353\/89 and B\/Panama\/45\/90. For all strains the post to end-titre decline was marginally higher in smokers. The end-titre was still slightly higher in smokers compared to non-smokers for B\/Panama\/45\/90 and B\/Beijing\/11\/87 and statistically signi\u00aecantly higher for A\/Singapore\/6\/86 (P = 0.04, adjusted for age, sex and risk group).\r\n In this study smokers did not have a greater incidence of serological or clinical in\u00afuenza compared to non-smokers. Odds ratios for smoking and serological in\u00afuenza were estimated from the serological data depicted in the studies of Finklea et al. [1] , Kark et al. [2] , and MacKenzie et al. [3] . These ORs were 1.3, 1.4 and 1.9, respectively, and are comparable to the odds ratio of 1.61 found in our study in the group receiving no real vaccination (placebo group). These results are consistent with the idea that the OR for the relation between smoking and in\u00afuenza is somewhere between 1 and 2, indicating that the eect is small. In our study no trend among the dierent smoking categories was found with serological or clinical in\u00afuenza as outcome variables. Smoking had no eect on clinical in\u00afuenza in our study. However, Finklea et al. and Kark et al. did \u00aend a relationship between smoking and clinical in\u00afuenza (odds ratios of about 1.5, p < 0.05 and 2.42, p < 0.0001 respectively).\r\n An eect of smoking on in\u00afuenza would be more plausible if smoking in\u00afuences the susceptibility to other viral infections as well. Cohen et al. found that smokers were at greater risk for getting common colds than non-smokers [16] . Smokers were more likely both to develop infection with rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus (OR = 2.23; 95% CI = 1.03, 4.82) and to develop illness following infection with these viruses (OR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.00, 3.36). In their review on cigarette smoking [17] . To summarize, studies on non-in\u00afuenza respiratory infections consistently show smokers to be at an increased risk. Vaccination of smokers against in\u00afuenza was serologically more ecacious compared to non-smokers in our study (see Table 3 ). As this was not expected and no other studies investigated the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination in smokers and non-smokers, we sought support for this \u00aending in the antibody response after vaccination. A greater titre rise due to vaccination was observed in smokers compared to non-smokers for two out of four strains 3 weeks after vaccination. A greater antibody response was also found by Finklea et al. [9] . In their study pre-vaccination titres (that were lower for smokers than non-smokers) leveled up after vaccination. A possible explanation is that smokers develop a better immunological protection after vaccination, resulting in a lower incidence of serological in\u00afuenza compared to non-smokers. The clinical relevance of this \u00aending appears to be low, because no dierence in ecacy of vaccination was found for clinical in\u00afuenza between smokers and non-smokers in our study. Also, MacKenzie et al. and Knowles et al. found no greater antibody response in smokers compared to non-smokers after vaccination with in\u00afuenza vaccine [3, 8] . Instead, hepatitis B vaccination has been shown to be less immunogenic in smokers versus nonsmokers in several studies [18\u00b120]. For example, for subjects receiving hepatitis B vaccine at 0, 1 and 6 months (standard schedule) it was found that vaccinated smokers had lower antibody levels than nonsmokers after 3, 7 and 13 months [18] . In summary, the tendency for smokers to have a higher antibody response than non-smokers found in our study is not found in other studies on in\u00afuenza vaccination (except Finklea et al.) and hepatitis B vaccination. The greater protection against serological in\u00afuenza in smokers Table 3 The ecacy of vaccination in smoker and non-smoker for people not previously vaccinated (rate as %) [14] . e Not corrected for covariables. f Corrected for age, sex, risk group and protective titre before vaccination. g Dierence in ecacy between smoker and non-smoker was signi\u00aecant (likelihood ratio = 11.81; p < 0.005; corrected for age, sex and risk group). Table 2 The eect of smoking on the incidence rate of in\u00afuenza in people not previously vaccinated and strati\u00aeed according to current vaccination status (rate as %) compared to non-smokers found in our study is therefore hardly supported by other immunological data. In our study the decline in titres 5 months after vaccination was similar for smokers and non-smokers, which is consistent with the \u00aending of Knowles et al. after a 3 month follow-up [8] . However, MacKenzie et al. and Finklea et al. found a depressed persistence of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody after 1 year in smokers compared to non-smokers [3, 9] . This raises the question if a depressed antibody titre in smokers compared to non-smokers after vaccination manifests itself only after several months. However, this question can not be decided with our data that covers a period of 5 months.\r\n It is important to consider potential limitations regarding the internal validity of the design. A possible bias is that the measurement of the smoking status could be in\u00afuenced by the outcome of clinical in\u00afuenza, because smoking status was measured 10 weeks after the start of the investigation. However, the hypotheses about smoking were not known to the patients during the data collection, making it unlikely that patients tried to report their smoking status dierently in order to please the investigators or to try and explain why they got in\u00afuenza. Selection biases are unlikely to occur because the data used in this study resulted from a randomized clinical trial. Beyer et al., Palache, Gross et al. and Poirier et al. pointed out some shortcomings in the research on in\u00afuenza vaccination [6, 21\u00b123] . In many studies on the ecacy of vaccination pre-vaccination titres, previous vaccination status, age, gender and the health status were not taken into account. In our study previously vaccinated patients were excluded, no dierences were found in pre-titres for smokers and non-smokers and corrections were made for age, gender and health status. Also vaccine doses are relevant for the interpretation of the results [23] . These vaccine doses were the same for all subjects. The in\u00afuenza activity in the in\u00afuenza season 1991\u00b11992 in the Netherlands was dominated by the strains A\/Singapore\/6\/86 (H1N1) and A\/Beijing\/353\/89 (H3N2) and therefore matched Geometric mean titre (GMT) = 10 logtitre : change(GMT) = 10 logchangevalue *10 logprevalue \u00c010 logprevalue . a CI indicates con\u00aedence interval. b Corrected for age, sex and risk group, but not for protective titre before vaccination (possible intermediate factor). c Subjects with serological in\u00afuenza were excluded (=a titre at end-titre r4 times the titre at post-titre) causing a small dierence to occur in the post-titre used in post-titre\u00b1pre-titre compared to the post-titre used in end-titre\u00b1post-titre. at least two of the strains used in the vaccine for that season [24] . In summary, no real threats to the validity of our results are found.\r\n No strong eects were found in this study. A slightly elevated, but not signi\u00aecant, risk for serological in\u00afuenza in the placebo group was found in smokers compared to non-smokers. This was consistent with previous studies, but did not result in a clinical dierence. Smokers were better protected than non-smokers against serological in\u00afuenza after vaccination and titre rise due to vaccination was higher in smokers than non-smokers for some (but not all) strains. However, little support for this \u00aending was found in the antibody response after vaccination in previous studies on in\u00afuenza or other infectious diseases. Finally, smokers did not have a lower immune titre 5 months after vaccination compared to non-smokers. We conclude that smoking may enhance the immunological response to vaccination in smokers, resulting in a higher protection against serological in\u00afuenza in smokers compared to non-smokers. Nevertheless, we found no clinically sig-ni\u00aecant eect of smoking on risk of in\u00afuenza and vaccine ecacy.","sha":"9630b95696daa16ef7377ab2fb1373b4cdf86058","publish_time":"1999-02-28","authors":"Cruijff, Mark; Thijs, Carel; Govaert, Theofiel; Aretz, Karin; Dinant, Geert Jan; Knottnerus, Andr\u00e9","journal":"Vaccine","doi":"10.1016\/s0264-410x(98)00213-8","Title":"Vaccine","H index":164.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Some studies found smokers to be more susceptible to in\u00afuenza compared to non-smokers [1\u00b13] .

The research period covered \u00aeve months (November 1991 until April 1992 . At the end of the follow up, 5 months after vaccination, a \u00aenal blood sample was taken (endtitre). A total of 1756 subjects (96%) returned this questionnaire. Titres less than 9 were arbitrarily set to 5. The serum levels were independently measured by two analysts. This was done for all sera from all samples for each individual strain. A series of control variables was available to see if alternative explanations might exist for the relations of interest.

We examined the role of GX-sPLA 2 during H1N1 pandemic influenza infection in a GX-sPLA 2 gene targeted mouse (GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 ) model and found that survival after infection was significantly greater in GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice than in GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice.

Based on the central role of sPLA 2 enzymes as key initiators of inflammatory processes, we propose that activation of GX-sPLA 2 during H1N1pdm infection is an early step of pulmonary inflammation and its inhibition increases adaptive immunity and improves survival. Our findings suggest that GX-sPLA 2 may be a potential therapeutic target during influenza.","text_body":"Influenza is a leading source of morbidity and mortality worldwide that is caused by ever changing and newly emerging influenza viruses including the introduction of the 2009 A\/H1N1\/2009 (H1N1pdm) and novel avian H7N9 viruses (Fisher et al., 2005; Groom and Luster, 2011; Widegren et al., 2011) . While effective vaccines and antiviral drugs have been developed for circulating strains of human influenza (Santone et al., 2008) , continued antigenic drift and shift generate novel virus strains that pose a threat to immunologically na\u00efve populations. The emergence of pandemic influenza H1N1pdm in the spring of 2009 led to hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations with significant numbers of fatalities in North America (Update: Influenza Activity -United States, 2009-10). Severe cases were characterized by viral pneumonia and uncontrollable pulmonary inflammation, and were similar to the inflammation observed in severe cases of SARS, H5N1 and Spanish Influenza patients (Baillie and Digard, 2013; Bermejo-Martin et al., 2010; Cameron et al., 2012; Curfs et al., 2008) Importantly there is little understood regarding the pathways driving the pulmonary inflammatory process for these diseases.\r\n Host-defenses against influenza include anatomic barriers, mucociliary clearance, anti-microbial secretions and innate and adaptive immune responses. Early host responses are characterized by the mobilization of leukocytes, such as alveolar and circulating macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) (World Health Organization, 2012) and NK cells which continues into the activation of adaptive immune cells such as T-cells, B-cells and dendritic cells. Importantly, factors that lead to the activation of these cells and cell networks are increased after H1N1pdm Infection (Influenza Activity -United States and Worldwide, 2010; Ohtsuki et al., 2006; Ohtsuki et al., 2006; Paquette et al., 2014) . These include inflammatory mediators such as chemokines, cytokines and lipid mediators like eicosanoids.\r\n The first step in the generation of eicosanoids, inflammatory mediators that participate in the regulation of the inflammatory response, is catalyzed by PLA 2 enzymes, which release arachidonic acid (AA) from phospholipids (Del et al., 2007) . To date, 11 secreted PLA 2 enzymes (sPLA 2 ; IB, IIA, IIC, IID, IIE, IIF, III, V, X, XIIA and XIIB) , six cytosolic PLA 2 enzymes (cPLA 2 s; \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5, and \u03be) (Kim et al., 2007) , nine Ca 2 \u00fe -independent PLA 2 enzymes (iPLA 2 s; \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 2 , \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b52 \u03be, \u03b8, and \u03b7) , and two lysosomal PLA 2 enzymes (Femling et al., 2005) have been described. The sPLA 2 enzymes are structurally related, Ca 2 \u00fe -dependent proteins with unique biological properties, enzymatic activities against membrane phospholipids and tissue and cellular locations, suggest distinct roles for these enzymes in various pathophysiological events. sPLA 2 enzymes are implicated in lipid mediator release, degranulation, cellular proliferation, destruction of invading bacteria , viruses (Kennedy et al., 1995; Mazur et al., 2007) and activation of intracellular signaling cascades (Kim et al., 2007) . GX-sPLA 2 is expressed in alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells in the lungs of patients with pneumonia (Marshall et al., 2000) , neuronal cells (Gaudreault and Gosselin, 2008) , male reproductive organs (Dennis, 1994) and atherosclerotic plaques , and is cleaved to its active form in inflamed tissues (Lu et al., 2006) .\r\n Arachidonic acid (AA) is the precursor of prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes and lipoxins, eicosanoids that regulate pulmonary vascular and bronchial responses, leukocyte activation, adhesion and emigration (Guan et al., 2013; Henderson et al., 1995) . Eicosanoids also regulate antigen presenting cell [APC] function (Degousee et al., 2001; Murakami et al., 2011; Truchetet et al., 2012) , T cell maturation (Myers et al., 2012) and Th17 expansion (Stephenson et al., 1988; Zhao et al., 2011) . We found that IL-17 and Th17 cells are dysregulated during human H1N1pdm infection (Baillie and Digard, 2013; Bermejo-Martin et al., 2010; Ohtsuki et al., 2006) . Therefore, sPLA 2 enzymes and eicosanoids may play a central role in determining the outcome of pulmonary viral infection. The role of sPLA 2 enzymes in the immune responses to H1N1pdm infection in vivo has not been evaluated.\r\n GX-sPLA 2 has been highly implicated in the inflammatory response including pattern recognition receptor function, and displays the highest activity among all mammalian sPLA 2 s on phosphatidylcholine-rich liposomes in vitro (Crooks and Stockley, 1998; Henderson et al., 1995) . Recently, GX-sPLA 2 has been suggested as a signal amplifier in TLR4 stimulation which further suggests a role for GX-sPLA 2 in the regulation of the inflammatory response (Schultz-Cherry and Jones, 2010) . Considering the potential of GX-sPLA 2 in the inflammatory response, sPLA 2 enzymes may play a central role in determining the outcome of pulmonary viral infections, which cause uncontrolled inflammatory destruction of the respiratory tract (Henderson et al., 1995) .\r\n We have developed a robust lethal mouse model of H1N1pdm infection to study innate host defense mechanisms and antiviral compound activity . We have shown that H1N1pdm infection in this mouse model leads to pulmonary inflammation, a histopathological picture similar to what is observed in fatal human cases, and over 90% lethality within 5-8 days . In this study, we document a marked increase in GX-sPLA 2 expression in lung following infection in GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice. To specifically evaluate the pathophysiological role of GX-sPLA 2 in our lethal influenza mouse model, we subjected GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice (Henderson et al., 1995) to H1N1pdm infection in vivo. Our results showed that, in two distinct mouse strains, targeted deletion of GX significantly increased survival following H1N1pdm infection in comparison with GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice. In addition, eicosanoid accumulation in BAL fluid was attenuated and induction of T cell and B cell associated genes was higher in GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 than GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice after H1N1pdm infection. Taken together, our data suggests a negative role for GX-sPLA 2 in the immune response to pulmonary infection with H1N1pdm influenza in vivo. Furthermore, these findings implicate GX-sPLA 2 as a potential therapeutic target during severe influenza infection.\r\n Airway epithelial cells and myeloid cells can both express GX-sPLA 2 (Marshall et al., 2000) . Previously, we have investigated the host immune responses to pulmonary viral infections, including infection with the influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1pdm (Baillie and Digard, 2013; Bermejo-Martin et al., 2010; Bhavsar et al., 2010; Cameron et al., 2008; Cameron et al., 2012; Escoffier et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2012; Kudo and Murakami, 1999) . Furthermore, we have also delineated the biology and molecular regulation of many of the enzymes that catalyze eicosanoid biosynthesis in vitro and in vivo Degousee et al., 2006; Degousee et al., 2008; Degousee et al., 2002; Degousee et al., 2003; Leon et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2006; Saez de et al., 2011) . To begin to investigate the role of GX-sPLA 2 during H1N1pdm infection, we evaluated the pulmonary expression of GX-sPLA 2 in our H1N1 pandemic influenza mouse model. GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice were infected intranasally with A\/Mexico\/4108\/ 2009 (H1N1pdm) and lung tissues were harvested at baseline and on day 3, 6 and 14 post infection (pi). Real-time PCR was performed on the extracted RNA and identified a significant increase in the ratio of GX-sPLA 2 to GAPDH mRNA on day 3 and day 14, but not day 6 pi (Fig. 1Ai) . GX-sPLA 2 \/GAPDH mRNA increased approximately four fold on day 3 and three fold on day 14 compared to baseline. Furthermore, we also determined the regulation of cytosolic PLA 2 (cPLA 2 ) (Fig. 1Aii ) and the sPLA 2 family member GV-PLA 2 (Fig. 1Aiii ) in both GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice. There was negligible total protein upregulation of cPLA 2 and GV-PLA 2 was not regulated throughout the infection time course. The absence of the change of total protein of cPLA 2 was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). No statistical differences in mRNA transcripts for cPLA 2 and GV-PLA 2 were noted between the GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe or GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice. These results demonstrated that H1N1pdm influenza infection stimulated a bimodal increase in pulmonary GX-sPLA 2 mRNA expression which was \/4108\/2009) and the lungs were assessed for the mRNA and protein expression and localization of PLAs during a 14 day time course. GX-sPLA 2 mRNA (Ai), cPLA 2 mRNA (Aii) and GV-sPLA 2 mRNA (Aiii) expression quantified by Real-Time RT-PCR was normalized to GAPDH, GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe (open bars) and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 (filled bars) mice (C3H\/HeN background mice). GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mouse lungs were perfusion fixed in situ with 4% paraformaldehyde, sectioned and subject to immunohistochemical analysis with the IgG fraction of rabbit anti-mouse GX-sPLA 2 antiserum (1\/100 dilution) (B). GIIA and GX-sPLA 2 protein expression determined by immunoblot analysis of lung tissue homogenates of wild type GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe (lane 1) and knockout GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 (lane 2) mice (C). For each blot, the corresponding recombinant sPLA 2 enzyme (rec sPLA 2 ) was run alone (lane 3) as a control. Representative results for five separate experiments are shown. All the mice used in these experiments were genotyped littermates and grouped and analyzed by their genotype. a, p o 0.05 GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe or GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 vs. base; b, p o 0.05 GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe vs. GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 at any time point, ANOVA followed by paired t-test, two tailed, assuming unequal variance. nZ 8 per group; 400 \u00c2 ; scale bar: 50 \u03bcm for immunohistochemistry. specific for this sPLA 2 since neither cPLA 2 nor GV-sPLA 2 was upregulated.\r\n Since GX-sPLA 2 mRNA levels increased in response to H1N1pdm infection, we investigated the spatial and temporal expression of GX-sPLA 2 protein in mouse lungs after influenza infection. Lungs from GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice infected with H1N1pdm were harvested at baseline, 3, 6 and 14 days pi and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis with anti-mouse GX-sPLA 2 antiserum. Visualization by light microscopy revealed GX-sPLA 2 protein accumulation in the lungs of infected mice compared to baseline (Fig. 1B) . GX-sPLA 2 protein was identified in inflammatory cells that had infiltrated in the alveolar space on day 3 and 6 in GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice infected with H1N1pdm (shown by arrows). GX-sPLA 2 protein was also clearly identified in epithelial cells lining the bronchioles on day 3, 6 and 14 in GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice infected with H1N1pdm (Fig. 1B , upper right panels). No staining for GX-sPLA 2 protein was observed in GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice at baseline or at any time point after infection with H1N1pdm (Fig. 1B , lower panel rows). Similarly, no proteins cross reacting with the secondary antibody alone was identified in GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe or GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice (Fig. 1B , left hand panels). We confirmed the loss of GX-sPLA 2 in the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice by immunoblot analysis. We indeed observed a specific depletion of GX-sPLA 2 but no change in the expression of GIIA-sPLA 2 in the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice compared to GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice (Fig. 1C ). Taken together, these results show that intranasal infection with H1N1pdm increases GX-sPLA 2 RNA and protein expression in the lung that corresponds to the increase in lung inflammation associated with influenza infection. This suggests a possible role for GX-sPLA 2 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary H1N1pdm influenza infection.\r\n Since GX-sPLA 2 was upregulated in the lung during H1N1pdm infection, we explored its role in the host response to pulmonary infection with H1N1pdm influenza. We first examined the clinical outcome of GX-sPLA 2 deletion by assessing weight loss and survival of G \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX-sPLA 2 gene targeted mice \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice on two different genetic backgrounds following infection and assessed weight loss and survival.\r\n In the first series of infections, GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe (n\u00bc25), GX \u00fe \/-(n\u00bc32), and GX \u00c0 \/\u00c0 (n\u00bc24) mice on a C57BL\/6J background were infected intranasally with H1N1pdm influenza A\/Mexico\/4108\/2009 ( Fig. 2A ). Mice on this background lack the GIIA-sPLA 2 gene (Karabina et al., 2006) . Animals were euthanized if their body weight decreased to less than 80% of baseline weight, or if the 14-day duration of the study was completed. Survival 14 days after H1N1pdm influenza infection was 70% in GX \u00c0 \/\u00c0 mice (blue line), 48% in GX \u00fe \/mice (green line) and 15% in GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice (red line). The difference in survival between GX \u00c0 \/\u00c0 and GX \u00fe \/mice, and between GX \u00c0 \/\u00c0 and GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice after H1N1pdm infection was statistically significant, pr0.01.\r\n To independently confirm these findings, we evaluated the survival of GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe (n\u00bc 71) and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 (n \u00bc 57) mice on a C3H\/HeN background (Fig. 2B) which have a functional GIIA-sPLA 2 gene (Karabina et al., 2006) . As with the studies with the C57BL\/6J mice, animals were infected intranasally with A\/Mexico\/4108\/2009 and euthanized if their body weight decreased to less than 80% of baseline weight, or at the end of the study. Survival of GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice on the C3H\/HeN background was again significantly higher (62%, blue line) following H1N1pdm infection than survival of GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice on a C3H\/HeN background (36%, red line). Together, these studies showed that targeted deletion of GX-sPLA 2 in two different mouse models led to increased survival following H1N1pdm infection in vivo. Furthermore, since the C3H\/HeN mice expressed endogenous GIIA-sPLA 2 , these results demonstrate that the ability to express GIIA-sPLA 2 does not compensate for the loss of GX-sPLA 2 during host immune responses to pulmonary H1N1pdm influenza infection.\r\n Depletion of GX-sPLA 2 during H1N1pdm infection leads to a decrease in downstream phospholipid catalysis (AA) products but no difference in innate cell recruitment GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX-sPLA 2 gene targeted mice \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 on a C3H\/HeN background were infected with A\/Mexico\/4108\/2009, and BAL fluid was harvested 3 or 6 days post H1N1pdm infection. To assess the general inflammatory response and lung tissue destruction that typically occurs during H1N1pdm infection (Ohtsuki et al., 2006; Paquette et al., 2012) , we investigated the histopathology by H&E staining of lungs isolated from both GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 and GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice at baseline, day 3, 6 and 14 pi (Fig. 3A) . The pulmonary pathology peaked quickly by day 3 pi in infected GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 animals. Bronchiolitis and alveolitis with mononuclear cell and neutrophil infiltration were observed in several loci of the infected lungs of both groups. Hemorrhage, edema, and necrotizing respiratory epithelia were also observed with similar severity among both groups. Pathology persisted until day 7 pi where mononuclear cell and neutrophil infiltration were still profound and caused patches of consolidation in the lung tissue in both groups. It seemed by day 14 pi that the pulmonary pathology was slightly more minimal in the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice with reduced level of leukocyte infiltration. In contrast, multi foci cell infiltration and tissue consolidation was still prominent in the GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe lungs by day 14 pi.\r\n To further examine the inflammatory cell types that may be recruited to the lung during H1N1pdm infection we analyzed lung homogenates from day 0, 3, 6 and 14 pi from both GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice by immunoblot for neutrophil and leukocyte cell markers, MPO and CD45 respectively. MPO was induced on day 3 and day 6 pi in both the mouse genotypes and returned to baseline on day 14 and CD45 was induced from baseline for all time points measured. Neither MPO nor CD45 showed any variation in the lungs between GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 or GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe throughout the infection time course (Fig. 3Bi) ; densitometry did not reveal any statistical differences (Fig. 3Bii) . Furthermore, we also analyzed GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 and GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe lungs for the presence and activation of macrophages by immunohistochemistry and Real-Time RT-PCR ( Fig. 3Ci , Cii and D). Here we found that the macrophage marker Mac-3 was significantly increased and peaked at day 6 following infection as determined by immunohistochemistry staining which was further confirmed by quantifying the staining and quantification of the signal ( Fig. 3Ci and Cii). Furthermore the mRNA for the inflammatory chemokine CCL2 was also significantly increased following infection (days 3 and 6) and decreased by day 14 (Fig. 3D) . No difference was determined for Mac-3 or CCL2 expression between GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 or GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice. Taken together, these results suggest a similar inflammatory and innate response in both the GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice.\r\n To assess the role of GX-sPLA 2 in leukocyte infiltration into the bronchoalveolar space after H1N1pdm infection, we measured total leukocyte cell counts and the levels of different leukocyte cell types in the BAL fluid of H1N1pdm infected in GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice (Fig. 4A ). No significant difference in total cell counts ( Fig. 4Ai ) or the percentage of CD4 \u00fe , CD8 \u00fe , B or natural killer cells, or granulocytes were identified in the BAL fluid of GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice 6 days after H1N1pdm infection (Fig. 4Aii ). In addition, targeted deletion of GX-sPLA 2 had no effect on lung viral titers 3 or 6 days pi (Fig. 4B ).\r\n We next determined by ELISA the levels of diferent AA metabolites including PGD 2 , LTB 4 , cysteinyl leukotrienes, PGE 2 , a stable PGE metabolite, and Lipoxin A 4 which are known to regulate bronchiolar reactivity and inflammatory cell adhesion, migration and activation (Henderson et al., 1995) were determined by ELISA. Levels of PGD 2 ( 5G ) were all significantly lower in the BAL fluid from GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice (solid bars) on day 3 pi compared to GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice. Conversely, on day 6 pi, the levels of these metabolites were similar in GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice ( Fig. 5A-F) . In summary, these results show that deletion of GX-sPLA 2 in mice led to a transient but significant decrease in the levels of a panel of AA metabolites when mice were infected with a lethal H1N1pdm influenza virus that was not associated with alterations in inflammatory cell infiltration or viral clearance.\r\n Increased expression of immunoglobulin chain, lymphocyte differentiation, antigen processing genes and presence of CD3 \u00fe T cells in the lungs of mice lacking GX-sPLA 2 after H1N1pdm infection\r\n To increase our understanding of the molecular events leading to increased survival following H1N1pdm infection in GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice, we conducted microarray analysis of RNA extracted from the lungs of GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 influenza infected animals. As previously reported by our group Paquette et al., 2014; , influenza infection caused a progressive increase in the total number of upregulated genes in the lung tissue of GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice (1246 genes at 3 days pi and 2469 genes at 6 days pi). Genes that belonged to different functional groups, such as immune response, inflammatory response and prostaglandin signaling pathways (Figs. 6 and 7) showed a progressive increase that was parallel to the global evolution of gene expression. Conversely, the expression of cytokine-related genes reached maximal levels 3 days pi and were maintained thereafter (Fig. 6A) .\r\n At first sight, lack of GX-sPLA 2 did not modify the global evolution of gene expression in the lungs. Similarly to GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice, GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice showed a progressive increase in the number of upregulated genes (1578 at 3 days pi and 2469 at 6 days pi). Further analysis demonstrated that on day 3 pi, GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice showed significantly higher levels of the cytokines LTA and LTB, the chemokines CCL19, CXCL9 and CXCL13 and the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CXCR5 ( Fig. 6B and C). In contrast, the expression pattern of cytokines and chemokines showed no differences between GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice 6 days pi (data not shown). Interestingly, expression of 21 immunoglobulin chains, including heavy and light chains, was identified in GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice 3 days pi, while no expression of immunoglobulin chain genes was identified in GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice at this time point. In addition, the number of immunoglobulin chain related genes was higher in GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 than GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice 6 days after H1N1pdm infection (Fig. 6B ). No differences were observed in the patterns of interferon regulated genes between GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice after H1N1pdm infection (data not shown).\r\n To determine which functional pathways are differentially enriched between GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice after H1N1pdm infection, we performed intersect analysis of the respective sets of upregulated genes (Fig. 7) . At 3 days pi, expression of interferon regulated, inflammatory response and innate immune response genes were common to both GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice. A number of genes related with eicosanoid synthesis and their receptors were found to be regulated during influenza infection; however, GX-sPLA 2 deficiency did not cause any major alterations in their expression profiles (Fig. S1) .\r\n The set of genes specifically enriched in the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice at 3 day pi were those related to adaptive immune responses, such as immunoglobulin chains, lymphocyte differentiation and antigen processing and presentation. On the other hand, the set of genes more enriched in the GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice were genes involved in the tissue development category at 3 days pi (Fig. 7A ). At 6 days pi (Fig. 7B) , the enrichment profiles of upregulated genes in GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice were nearly identical. While immunoglobulin chain gene expression was identified in both GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice, expression of immunoglobulin chain genes remained elevated only in the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 set of genes 6 days pi, while the GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe set of genes continued to show enrichment in the tissue development category at day 6 pi.\r\n To further evaluate the adaptive immune system of the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice infected with H1N1pdm we investigated the T and B cell responses within the lung during infection. Here we stained lung sections with anti-CD3 to assess infiltration of T cells using immunocytochemistry ( Fig. 8A and B) . We found a significant increase of CD3 positive T cells in the lung on day 3 pi in the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice compared to GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice (Fig. 8A , upper right panels) by approximately 2 fold (Fig. 8B) . Interestingly, CD3 staining of the GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe animals had increased to similar levels seen in the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice by day 6 and both genotypes had sustained levels of CD3 on day 14. Moreover, we also investigated CD8A and IgG (IGHG) mRNA levels in the lungs of the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice throughout the time course and there was a slight trend for increase CD8A levels. Taken together, the results from the CD3 and IgG analysis supported the microarray studies where the adaptive immune system of the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 had a faster and more robust initiation.\r\n GX-sPLA 2 has been highly implicated in various inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract, including Th2 cytokine-driven asthma (de Jong et al., 2006; Henderson et al., 2007) and lung injury (Napolitani et al., 2009 ), but its role during influenza infection has not been previously investigated. Here we evaluated the pathophysiological role of GX-sPLA 2 during severe influenza A H1N1pdm infection in the mouse. We found that GX-sPLA 2 expression was increased following infection, and that targeted deletion of GX-sPLA 2 led to increased survival in mice. Lack of GX-sPLA 2 resulted in decreased levels of PGD 2 , LTB 4 , cysteinyl leukotrienes, PGE 2 and Lipoxin A 4 and increased adaptive immune responses at 3 but not 6 days following H1N1pdm infection. This demonstrates that GX-sPLA 2 plays an important role in the production of several biologically active inflammatory lipid mediators during the early phase of the inflammatory response that follows H1N1pdm influenza infection. Human patients with a severe respiratory disease caused by influenza infection have a dysregulated inflammatory response that leads to lung pathogenesis associated with hypercytokinemia in most cases (Bermejo-Martin et al., 2010; Curfs et al., 2008) . Taken together with the previous findings showing a role of GX-sPLA 2 in inflammatory lung diseases, our work supports the further investigation of the therapeutic potential of attenuating GX-sPLA 2 during severe influenza infection as well as the interplay between eicosanoids and adaptive immunity. sPLA 2 has previously been implicated in pulmonary disease onset and progression putting it forth as a potential biomarker for severe respiratory diseases (Henderson et al., 1995; Henderson et al., 2007) . We show that GX-sPLA 2 protein and mRNA expression increased in the lungs of GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice following H1N1pdm infection, suggesting that GX-sPLA 2 may be used as a possible biomarker of severe influenza infection. This is the first report of increased GX-sPLA 2 expression following influenza virus infection. Both epithelial cells and leukocytes were found to be sources of GX-sPLA 2 during infection, and GX-sPLA 2 expression was detected in epithelial cells 3 days prior to the infiltration of leukocytes. In will be interesting to determine in future experiments whether the specific deletion of GX-sPLA 2 expression in epithelial cells vs.\r\n infiltrating leukocytes or both is responsible for the increased survival. Here we observed a bimodal expression pattern of GX-sPLA 2 during the 14 day time course of infection. It is possible that this occurred due to the protein stability as it is used to regulate bioactive lipid mediator synthesis. If the protein does not remain stable throughout the course of infection and recovery, it may be important to have a second increase in GX-sPLA 2 in the later stages of infection to compensate for the loss of protein. It is in fact possible that the protein exerts distinct roles in the clearance of the virus and tissue remodeling in addition to the regulation of immune cells. Such a scenario would require inductions at specific time points during infection. It will be important to further explore the local expression in the virus niche and the stability of protein GX-sPLA 2 during influenza infection to better understand how GX-sPLA 2 stability may influence influenza severity in the initiation of the innate immune response, adaptive maintenance, and recovery. Furthermore, it would also be of value to investigate the source of GX-sPLA 2 by expression analysis of each cell type and also by investigating the role of hematopoietic GX-sPLA 2 compared to epithelial GX-sPLA 2 . The latter could be studied by employing bone marrow transplantation experiments from GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice into GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and the reverse. While the association between GX-sPLA 2 and influenza related complications has not previously been investigated, LTB 4 , a downstream product of GX-sPLA 2 has been suggested to be a biomarker for pulmonary disease and respiratory complications following trauma (Influenza Activity -United States and Worldwide, 2010; Henderson et al., 2011; Shridas et al., 2011) .\r\n Multiple studies have implicated GX-sPLA 2 in the pathophysiology of pulmonary diseases onset and progression, suggesting GX-sPLA 2 might be a suitable therapeutic target in lung (Henderson et al., 1995; Morita et al., 2013) . Deletion of GX-sPLA 2 in a Th2 cytokine-driven mouse asthma model significantly impairs development of asthma (Henderson et al., 1995) and accordingly, administration of a human GX-sPLA 2 selective inhibitor in a human GX-sPLA 2 knock-in mouse model led to a significant reduction in airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion and airway hyperresponsiveness (Henderson et al., 2007) . Furthermore, although not specific for human GX-sPLA 2 , the indole-based sPLA 2 inhibitor varespladib has been shown to significantly inhibit sPLA 2 activity in the BAL fluid of infants with post-neonatal ARDS (de Jong et al., 2006) during induced asthma, suggesting the involvement of sPLA 2 among other sPLA 2 s. Our results showing increased survival of the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice after infection with H1N1pdm further support the notion that GX-sPLA 2 is a therapeutic target in pulmonary diseases due to viral infection and that infection with H1N1 might be better controlled by inhibiting this sPLA 2 .\r\n One of the main functions of GX-sPLA 2 is likely the generation of bioactive lipid mediators which play important roles in lung inflammatory diseases (Gao et al., 2013; Gaudreault and Gosselin, 2007; Van Elssen et al., 2011) . Although we did not see any major differences in the mRNA analysis of the eicosanoid pathways between the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 and GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice, measuring the mRNA levels of these genes may have limited value to determine the level of activation of their signaling pathways. Conversely, we observed decreased levels of PGD 2 , LTB 4 , cysteinyl leukotrienes, PGE 2 and Lipoxin A 4 in BAL fluid 3 day pi in the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice, indicating that GX-sPLA 2 acts upstream of these bioactive lipid mediators during influenza infection and thereby suggests a possible role of these bioactive mediators in pulmonary pathogenesis after influenza infection. In agreement with our findings, PGD 2 has been implicated during influenza A infection as PGD 2 expression in the lungs of older animals inhibits regulatory dendritic cells activity and T cell responses (Zhang et al., 2000) . Other eicosanoids have been implicated in different lung diseases, and the dysregulation of leukotrienes and lipoxins have been reported as contributing factors to the pathogenesis and severity of other respiratory diseases (Bermejo-Martin et al., 2009) . LTB 4 has been suggested to play a destructive inflammatory role in the lung by priming neutrophils for adhesion, chemotaxis and stimulation of granule release (Cameron et al., 2007) . As well PGD 2 , PGD receptor, lipocalin-type PGD synthase and LTB 4 have been implicated in asthma pathogenesis (Arima and Fukuda, 2011; Masuda et al., 2005; Rusinova et al., 2012) . Although asthma and pulmonary disease due to influenza infection differ in derivation, both are characterized by hyper-inflammation of the respiratory tract. Taken together, our data supports a role of GX-sPLA 2 signaling and bioactive mediator production in the regulation of the pulmonary response to H1N1pdm infection. In the future it would be important to specifically determine whether PGD 2 , LTB 4 , cysteinly leukotrienes, PGE 2 , Lipoxin A 4 or another AA metabolite specifically modulates the response to H1N1pdm infection.\r\n The inflammatory response may be simultaneously beneficial and destructive during lung infection (Baillie and Digard, 2013; Fig. 2 . Increased survival of GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 vs. GX \u00fe \/ \u00c0 or GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice following A\/Mexico\/ 4108\/2009 infection. GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe (n\u00bc 25), GX \u00fe \/ \u00c0 (n \u00bc32), and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 (n\u00bc24) mice (C57BL\/6J background, lacks GIIA-sPLA 2 ) were infected intranasally with A\/Mexico\/ 4108\/2009 and survival was assessed for a 14 day period (A). GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe (n\u00bc71) and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 (n\u00bc 57) mice (C3H\/HeN background, expresses GIIA-sPLA 2 ) were infected intranasally with A\/Mexico\/4108\/2009 and survival was assessed for a 14 day period (B). Animals were sacrificed if their body weight decreased to less than 80% of baseline weight, or if the 14-day duration of the study was completed. Log rank test, p o0.05 GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 vs. GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00fe \/ \u00c0 mice or po 0.05, GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 vs. GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice. All the mice used in these experiments were genotyped littermates and grouped and analyzed by their genotype. Bermejo-Martin et al., 2010) . Although destructive killing of foreign pathogens is imperative for eradication and microbe clearing, the over production of inflammatory mediators leading to an overt inflammatory response may accentuate disease pathology, as is the case during severe influenza H5N1 and H1N1 infection (Bermejo-Martin et al., 2010; Curfs et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2009) . This illustrates the dual role of proinflammatory mediators, which has also been suggested for some GX-sPLA 2 downstream lipid mediators. For instance, LTB 4 has been shown to increase the activity of nasal neutrophil killing of human coronavirus, RSV, and influenza B virus (Van Elssen et al., 2011) and to induce the release of antimicrobial peptides in vivo in the lungs of Fig. 3 . Infection with H1N1pdm influenza induces similar pulmonary inflammation and recruitment of inflammatory cells in GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice. GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice (C3H\/HeN background mice) were infected with H1N1pdm (A\/Mexico\/4108\/2009) influenza and the lungs were perfusion fixed in situ with 4% paraformaldehyde on specific time points following infection, sectioned and subject to hematoxylin and eosin staining (A). MPO protein (neutrophil marker), CD45 protein (leukocyte marker) and GAPDH protein (loading control) expression levels were determined by immunoblot analysis from lung tissue homogenates of GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice over a 14 day time course of H1N1pdm influenza infection (Bi). Densitometric analysis of MPO (Bii) and CD45 (Biii) protein levels normalized to GAPDH levels in lung tissue of GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe (open bars) and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 (filled bars) mice after H1N1pdm influenza infection, are presented. Immunohistochemical analysis with specific rabbit primary antibody against mouse Mac-3 antigen (marker for macrophages) is shown (Ci). Assessment of Mac-3 positive cells (indicated by -) per high power field before, 3, 6 or 14 days after infection with H1N1pdm influenza is shown (Cii). CCL2 mRNA expression normalized to GAPDH was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in lung tissue of GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice after H1N1pdm influenza infection (D). Representative images ( \u00c2 200) from five independent experiments are shown.

The lipid product protectin D1 has been implicated in influenza therapeutics (Arima and Fukuda, 2011; Mitsuishi et al., 2006) . Although these previous reports seem to suggest a conflicting role for GX-sPLA 2 in consideration of our data, it may be possible that LTB 4 and GX-sPLA 2 promote antiviral activity and are significant during a viral response but only at moderate levels. Alternatively, it is possible that GX-sPLA 2 prevents H1N1 infection but also triggers excessive inflammation that is associated with lipid surfactant destruction. More work is needed to understand how the function of GX-sPLA 2 mediates both beneficial and deleterious roles during influenza infection.\r\n Our survival data from GX gene targeted mice indicated that the loss of GX-sPLA 2 was beneficial to the host during influenza infection. The microarray mRNA data from lungs of GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe infected mice were in agreement with our previously published data on pandemic H1N1 2009 virus infection, in mice including the progressive increase of immune and inflammatory responses and of the prostaglandin signaling pathway (Paquette et al., 2014) . Together, the results of microarray analysis, gene expression by Real-Time RT PCR and immunocytochemistry of the lungs suggested that GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice exhibited a more robust adaptive immune response than GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice. Indeed, we observed significant differences in lymphocyte gene profiles at day 3 pi, associated with differences in the levels of lymphotoxin alpha and beta, B cell chemokines, T cell chemokine receptors and B cell immunoglobulin chains as measured which by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. Expression of B cell immunoglobulin chain genes were substantially increased on day 3 pi in the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice but not in the GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe . B cell immunoglobulin gene expression was significantly greater on day 6 pi. and the expression of the T cell, B cell and dendritic cell chemokines and chemokine receptors, i.e., CCL19, CXCR3, etc., were significantly higher in the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 samples than GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe . These results suggest that the downstream products of GX-sPLA 2 , such as PGD 2 , PGE 2 , LTB 4 may inhibit the early adaptive immune responses of T and B cells during viral infection and this fits with the fact that aspirin, which attenuates eicosanoid production, can be an effective therapy for patients with influenza infection (Matsuoka et al., 2000) . It would be of value in future studies to further investigate the effect of GX-sPLA 2 on the proliferation, activation and differentiation of T and B lymphocytes. Consistent with this notion, the chemokines and chemokine receptors found to be upregulated in the H1N1pdm infected GX \u00c0 \/\u00c0 mice are known to play significant roles in T and B cell migration and localization to the lymph nodes (Goracci et al., 2010; Muthuswamy et al., 2010) . CXCL13\/CXCR5 signaling has been shown to activate B cells (Sadik and Luster, 2012) , which may explain the increased immunoglobulin chain gene expression observed in GX \u00c0 \/\u00c0 mice. Our data supports previous findings implicating PGD 2 in the inhibition of cell migration to lymph nodes (Zhang et al., 2000) , and PGE 2 in the inhibition of adaptive immune cellular events such as chemokine production by DCs and the attraction of na\u00efve T cells (Murakami et al., 2011; Truchetet et al., 2012) .\r\n In conclusion, our findings provide new insights into the molecular pathophysiology of lethal influenza infection, highlighting a new role for GX-sPLA 2 during H1N1pdm infection. Overall, the sPLA 2 appears as a negative effector but it may act at several steps during infection. We found that GX-sPLA 2 and its downstream products may have a role in the inhibition of adaptive immunity during viral infection in mice thereby contributing to pathogenesis. Within this mechanism, it is in fact possible that T and B cell maturation and activation are initiated in mice lacking GX-sPLA 2 prior to virus infection, and that a more robust and earlier adaptive Fig. 4 . Lung viral titers and cell counts in BAL fluid show similar cell numbers and cell population distributions following infection in GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice. GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 and GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice infected with A\/Mexico\/4108\/2009 were investigated for lung cell numbers, populations and viral load. BAL fluid was harvested from infected GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe (open bars) and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 (filled bars) mice (C3H\/HeN background mice) on day 0 and 6 and the cell numbers (Ai) and cell population distributions (Aii) were assessed by FACS. Viral load was determined on day 0, 3 and 6 pi of GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe (open bars) and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 (filled bars) mice by Real-Time RT-PCR vRNA quantification (B). All the mice used in these experiments were genotyped littermates and grouped and analyzed by their genotype. a, p o0.05 GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe vs. base, ANOVA followed by paired t-test, two tailed, assuming unequal variance. nZ 7 per group.\r\n immune response increased the survival of GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice after H1N1pdm infection. Since GX-sPLA 2 may contribute to inflammatory response dysregulation during influenza infection and contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with hospitalized influenza patients, this work may shed important insight into the molecular mechanisms of severe influenza infection. Our findings further support the notion that GX-sPLA 2 is an interesting therapeutic target in lung inflammatory diseases. Whether inhibition or attenuation of GX-sPLA 2 activity during severe influenza infection has a therapeutic effect remains to be demonstrated.\r\n To dissect the role of GX-sPLA 2 in the molecular regulation of pulmonary infection with H1N1pdm influenza, mice that lack GX-sPLA 2 (GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice) on the C57BL\/6J background previously described were used (Matsuoka et al., 2000) . This mixed background strain has a naturally occurring mutation in the gene encoding GIIA-sPLA 2 (Karabina et al., 2006) , which has been Fig. 5 . Decreased eicosanoid levels in the BAL fluid 3 but not 6 days after infection with A\/Mexico\/4108\/2009 in GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 vs. GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice. The eicosanoid levels in the BAL fluid of GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 and GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice (C3H\/HeN background) were investigated at baseline and following infection with A\/Mexico\/4108\/2009. GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe (open bars) and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 (filled bars) mice (C3H\/HeN background mice) BAL fluid was harvested by instilling ice cold NaCl (1 ml) five times and pooled. Levels of PGD 2 MOX (A), LTB 4 (B), cysteinyl leukotrienes (C), PGE 2 (D), stable PGE metabolite (E), PGE 2 plus PGE metabolite (F) and Lipoxin A 4 (G) were assessed by ELISA. These results are the mean of 5 independent studies. All the mice used in these experiments were genotyped littermates and grouped and analyzed by their genotype.

Furthermore, we generated GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice on the C3H\/HeN background (Fig. 1C ) by backcrossing the C57BL\/6J GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice for 10 generations which had functional GIIA-sPLA 2 .\r\n Mice were maintained on standard animal feed and water ad libitum in the conventional environmental conditions and controlled temperature and humidity with a 12 h light and dark cycle. For infection studies, animals were housed in HEPA-filtered cage racks adherent to ABSL2 \u00fe conditions (Toronto General Hospital, Animal Resource Centre, Toronto, Canada). All animal procedures were performed in a certified class II biosafety cabinet (Baker Company, Sanford, NC, USA). Housing and experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University Health Network, and were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals Research Statutes, Ontario (1980) .\r\n All infection experiments were conducted with H1N1pdm strain, A\/Mexico\/4108\/2009 (H1N1pdm), provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA). Virus was propagated and titrated in embryonated eggs and titrated prior to animal challenge. Viral stocks were stored in liquid nitrogen and thawed prior to use. Mice were weighed and randomly assigned for sample collection, and were infected through intranasal instillation with 50 mL phosphate-buffered saline (mock infection) or 50 mL A\/Mexico\/4108\/2009 (H1N1pdm) at 1 \u00c2 10 5 or 1 \u00c2 10 4 50% egg infectious dose (EID) 50 . Virus dosage were 1 \u00c2 10 4 EID 50 and \u00c2 10 5 EID 50 for host response profiling in C57BL\/6J mice and 1 \u00c2 10 4 EID 50 for comparing disease severity between GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice. Throughout infection experiments, animal survival, clinical signs, and weights were recorded daily. In accordance with Animal Care Committee recommendation, mice were euthanized when recorded body weight fell below 80% of original body weight.\r\n At day 0, 3 and 6 pi, 3 GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and 3 GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice were euthanized and lung homogenates collected for viral load determination by either Madin-Darby Canin Kidney (MDCK) cell growth determination or Real-time RT-PCR (RNA Analysis methods and Table S1 ). For MDCK determination lungs were homogenized (10% w\/v) in High Glucose (4.5 g\/L) Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, 50 mg\/mL Gentamycin, 100 U\/mL Penicillin, 100 mg\/mL Streptomycin, and 1 mg\/mL TPCK-Trypsin (vDMEM). Homogenates were then serially diluted (0.5 log 10 ) in quadruplicate over Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells, cultured at 2.0 \u00c2 10 4 cells\/well in 96-well plates. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 1C and 5% CO 2 . Homogenates were then removed and replaced with fresh vDMEM. Cells infected were incubated for 6 days at 37 1C and 5% Fig. 6 .

After supernatant aspiration, the pellet was extracted with 1 ml of ice-cold acetone and centrifuged again. The acetone extracts were combined and the acetone evaporated under nitrogen. All the samples were then methoximated (PGD 2 -MOX EIA kit (Cayman Chemical), and purified on Oasis HLB columns (Waters Corporation) equilibrated with methanol\/0.2% formic acid. Methanol eluants were evaporated in a Savant Speed Vac concentrator and samples dissolved in Cayman EIA buffer before EIA analysis, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\r\n Analysis of PGE 2 , LTB 4 and cysteinyl leukotriens in BAL fluid 1.2 ml of BAL fluid was mixed with 2.4 ml of methanol containing 0.2% formic acid, incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 3000g for 10 min at 4 1C.

The supernatants were diluted with water to achieve 11% methanol concentration and adjusted to pH 3.5 with 1N HCl. Samples were purified on C18 Sep-Pak columns (Waters Corporation) preconditioned with methanol. After column wash with water followed by hexane, samples were eluted with methyl formate. The eluants were evaporated under nitrogen and the samples reconstituted in EIA buffer and assayed for Lipoxin A 4 content (Neogen Corporation) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\r\n Lung tissues from both GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 and GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice were collected at 3 and 6 days pi and from uninfected controls (four mice per group) as with the Real Time RT-PCR. RNA was purified from lung tissue using TriPure (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and amplified with Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). 1.5 mg of cRNA was labeled and hybridized to Mouse WG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and scanned on Illumina BeadStation 500GX. Raw data was processed with Illumina GenomeStudio V2010.3 software. The data sets were subjected to quantile normalization, variance stabilization and log 2 transformation. Genes were considered significantly regulated if the expression levels with respect to the uninfected controls were Z1.5fold different and the Student t-test's p value was o0.05. DAVID Bioinformatics Resource v6.7 (http:\/\/david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov\/home.jsp) (Hicks et al., 2007) was used to perform functional classification of differentially expressed genes.

Importantly, factors that lead to the activation of these cells and cell networks are increased after H1N1pdm Infection (Influenza Activity -United States and Worldwide, 2010; Ohtsuki et al., These include inflammatory mediators such as chemokines, cytokines and lipid mediators like eicosanoids. 2007) , nine Ca 2 \u00fe -independent PLA 2 enzymes (iPLA 2 s; \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 2 , \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b52 \u03be, \u03b8, and \u03b7) , and two lysosomal PLA 2 enzymes (Femling et al., 2000) , neuronal cells (Gaudreault and Gosselin, 2008) , male reproductive organs (Dennis, 1994) and atherosclerotic plaques , and is cleaved to its active form in inflamed tissues (Lu et al., 2012) and Th17 expansion (Stephenson et al., Recently, GX-sPLA 2 has been suggested as a signal amplifier in TLR4 stimulation which further suggests a role for GX-sPLA 2 in the regulation of the inflammatory response (Schultz-Cherry and Jones, 2010) . Considering the potential of GX-sPLA 2 in the inflammatory response, sPLA 2 enzymes may play a central role in determining the outcome of pulmonary viral infections, which cause uncontrolled inflammatory destruction of the respiratory tract (Henderson et al., We have developed a robust lethal mouse model of H1N1pdm infection to study innate host defense mechanisms and antiviral compound activity . Taken together, our data suggests a negative role for GX-sPLA 2 in the immune response to pulmonary infection with H1N1pdm influenza in vivo. Previously, we have investigated the host immune responses to pulmonary viral infections, including infection with the influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1pdm (Baillie and Digard, 2013; Bermejo-Martin et al., 1Aii ) and the sPLA 2 family member GV-PLA 2 (Fig. Representative results for five separate experiments are shown.

GX-sPLA 2 protein was also clearly identified in epithelial cells lining the bronchioles on day 3, 6 and 14 in GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice infected with H1N1pdm (Fig. Taken together, these results show that intranasal infection with H1N1pdm increases GX-sPLA 2 RNA and protein expression in the lung that corresponds to the increase in lung inflammation associated with influenza infection. Mice on this background lack the GIIA-sPLA 2 gene (Karabina et al., Animals were euthanized if their body weight decreased to less than 80% of baseline weight, or if the 14-day duration of the study was completed. Bronchiolitis and alveolitis with mononuclear cell and neutrophil infiltration were observed in several loci of the infected lungs of both groups. Furthermore the mRNA for the inflammatory chemokine CCL2 was also significantly increased following infection (days 3 and 6) and decreased by day 14 (Fig. No significant difference in total cell counts ( Fig. We next determined by ELISA the levels of diferent AA metabolites including PGD 2 , LTB 4 , cysteinyl leukotrienes, PGE 2 , a stable PGE metabolite, and Lipoxin A 4 which are known to regulate bronchiolar reactivity and inflammatory cell adhesion, migration and activation (Henderson et al., Increased expression of immunoglobulin chain, lymphocyte differentiation, antigen processing genes and presence of CD3 \u00fe T cells in the lungs of mice lacking GX-sPLA 2 after H1N1pdm infection\r\n To increase our understanding of the molecular events leading to increased survival following H1N1pdm infection in GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice, we conducted microarray analysis of RNA extracted from the lungs of GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 influenza infected animals. 6 and 7) showed a progressive increase that was parallel to the global evolution of gene expression. Similarly to GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice, GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice showed a progressive increase in the number of upregulated genes (1578 at 3 days pi and 2469 at 6 days pi). In addition, the number of immunoglobulin chain related genes was higher in GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 than GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice 6 days after H1N1pdm infection (Fig. A number of genes related with eicosanoid synthesis and their receptors were found to be regulated during influenza infection; however, GX-sPLA 2 deficiency did not cause any major alterations in their expression profiles (Fig. 7B) , the enrichment profiles of upregulated genes in GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe and GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice were nearly identical. Human patients with a severe respiratory disease caused by influenza infection have a dysregulated inflammatory response that leads to lung pathogenesis associated with hypercytokinemia in most cases (Bermejo-Martin et al., Taken together with the previous findings showing a role of GX-sPLA 2 in inflammatory lung diseases, our work supports the further investigation of the therapeutic potential of attenuating GX-sPLA 2 during severe influenza infection as well as the interplay between eicosanoids and adaptive immunity. Such a scenario would require inductions at specific time points during infection. While the association between GX-sPLA 2 and influenza related complications has not previously been investigated, LTB 4 , a downstream product of GX-sPLA 2 has been suggested to be a biomarker for pulmonary disease and respiratory complications following trauma (Influenza Activity -United States and Worldwide, 2010; Henderson et al., In the future it would be important to specifically determine whether PGD 2 , LTB 4 , cysteinly leukotrienes, PGE 2 , Lipoxin A 4 or another AA metabolite specifically modulates the response to H1N1pdm infection.

Our survival data from GX gene targeted mice indicated that the loss of GX-sPLA 2 was beneficial to the host during influenza infection. Together, the results of microarray analysis, gene expression by Real-Time RT PCR and immunocytochemistry of the lungs suggested that GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice exhibited a more robust adaptive immune response than GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice. Expression of B cell immunoglobulin chain genes were substantially increased on day 3 pi in the GX \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice but not in the GX \u00fe \/ \u00fe .

We first demonstrated that PRRSV infection significantly results in the increased double-membrane vesicles, the accumulation of LC3 fluorescence puncta, and the raised ratio of LC3-II\/b-actin, in MARC-145 cells. Then we discovered that induction of autophagy by rapamycin significantly enhances the viral titers of PRRSV, while inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA and silencing of LC3 gene by siRNA reduces the yield of PRRSV. The results showed functional autolysosomes can be formed after PRRSV infection and the autophagosome-lysosome-fusion inhibitor decreases the virus titers. We also examined the induction of autophagy by PRRSV infection in pulmonary alveolar macrophages. These findings indicate that autophagy induced by PRRSV infection plays a role in sustaining the replication of PRRSV in host cells.","text_body":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) which is one of the most economically important infectious diseases for the pig industry worldwide (Garner et al., 2001; Neumann et al., 2005; Pejsak et al., 1997; Rossow, 1998) . The virus has a positive-stranded genomic RNA packaged in an enveloped icosahedral viral capsid, and is classified in the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus, along with equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (Cavanagh, 1997) . Members of genus Arterivirus replicate in the replication complexes which are double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) probably derived from paired endoplasmic reticulum membranes (Pedersen et al., 1999) . Previous studies have suggested that the nonstructural proteins (Nsps) of arteriviruses play a crucial role in the formation of replication complexes (Pedersen et al., 1999; Snijder et al., 2001; van der Meer et al., 1998) . However, it is unknown how the replication complexes for PRRSV generate and how the Nsps of PRRSV interact with host cells.\r\n In eukaryocytes, autophagy is a widely existed conservative mechanism, which can transport long-lived cytoplasmic proteins and damaged organelles to lysosomes to degrade for maintaining the cellular homeostasis (Klionsky, 2007; Klionsky and Emr, 2000) . During the autophagy process, long-lived proteins and damaged organelles are wrapped in autophagosomes, a kind of doublemembrane vesicles which are considered as one of the hallmarks of autophagy; the matured autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes in which the content is degraded (Klionsky and Emr, 2000) . Two ubiquitin-like molecules, the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and Atg12p, are necessary for the formation and maturation of autophagosome. LC3 is the most widely used molecular marker for monitoring autophagy (Kirkegaard et al., 2004; Klionsky et al., 2008; Ohsumi, 2001) . The lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), a marker of autolysosomes, is required for the fusion of autophagosomes and endosomal vesicles (Kirkegaard et al., 2004) . The autophagy pathway is regulated under various GTPases, kinases and phosphatases. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) regulate two mechanisms respectively, which are considered the best molecules to manipulate the early stage of autophagosome formation (Petiot et al., 2000; Ravikumar et al., 2004) . Additionally, bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar type H \u00fe -ATPase (V-ATPase), is an efficient inhibitor for the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes (Yamamoto et al., 1998) .\r\n Autophagy is not only necessary for cellular homeostasis, but also plays an important role in other physiological and pathological processes (Levine and Kroemer, 2008; Mizushima, 2007) , as well as in both adaptive immunity and innate immunity (Levine and Deretic, 2007; Menendez-Benito and Neefjes, 2007) . In recent years, a number of studies have revealed the direct interaction between autophagy and viral infection. Although autophagy is considered as a central component of host defense machinery against bacterial, viral, and protozoa infections (Levine and Deretic, 2007; Schmid and M\u00fcnz, 2007; Talloczy et al., 2006) , some viruses have evolved mechanisms to escape autophagy of host cells (Chou and Roizman, 1994; Harrow et al., 2004; Ohsumi, 2001; Suhy et al., 2000) , or may utilize autophagy for their own benefit of replication (Wong et al., 2008) . Certain positivestranded RNA viruses and cytoplasmic DNA viruses replicate in cytoplasmic membranes which display some hallmarks of autophagosomes such as double membrane and positive for the autophagy protein LC3 (Suhy et al., 2000) . Autophagy induced ;by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and encephalomycarditis virus (EMCV) infection can promote the viral replication (Wong et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2011) . In coronaviruses, it has been demonstrated that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) can utilize part of autophagy to replicate or the autophagy mechanism to enhance their replication (de Haan and Reggiori, 2008; Prentice et al., 2004) . However, other studies have suggested that the autophagy pathway or the component of autophagy was not essential for the replication of coronaviruses (Zhao et al., 2007; Cottam et al., 2011) . More investigations need to be conducted to provide more evidence whether nidoviruses actually hijack the autophagy pathway for their own replication. In the present study, we demonstrated that autophagy can be induced in the permissive MARC-145 cells and the natural host cell-pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) upon PRRSV infection, and meanwhile investigated the role of autophagy in the replication of PRRSV.\r\n To determine whether autophagy is induced in MARC-145 cells by PRRSV infection, the monolayer MARC-145 cells were inoculated with PRRSV and then subjected to TEM, confocal microscopy or western blotting assays at indicated timepoints. The cells were subjected to TEM and confocal microscopy at 72 h postinfection (pi). And the cells were harvested from 24 h pi to 96 h pi with the time interval of 24 h for western blotting analysis to detect LC3 so as to monitor the progress of autophagy. Meanwhile, the virus titers in supernatants of cell culture at all timepoints were assayed to track the replication of PRRSV.\r\n Complete mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum structures were observed in mock-infected MARC-145 cells (Fig. 1A) , while the PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells exhibited massive doublemembrane vesicles and single-membrane vesicles around the perinuclear region (termed as autophagosome-like vesicles) (Fig. 1B) . By confocal microscopy analyses, it was indicated that the PRRSV-infected cell presented significant enhancement of LC3 signals with the fluorescence punctuates accumulation (Fig. 1G) , while the mock-infected cell had weak LC3 signals without the visible fluorescence punctuates accumulation (Fig. 1D) . In addition, no LC3 punctuates accumulation was observed in the uninfected cells. Moreover, as the LC3 signals of infected cells, the PRRSV N protein signals in the infected cells also presented fluorescence punctuates accumulation (Fig. 1F) , and the fluorescence punctuates of N protein were highly colocalized with the fluorescence punctuates of LC3 (Fig. 1H ). Nsp2 is necessary and sufficient to induce the formation of double-membrane structures during the formation of the arterivirus replication complex (Snijder et al., 2001) . Thus Nsp2 can be used as a marker of replication units on some degree. By the confocal microscopy with Nsp2 antibodies and LC3 antibodies, perinuclear fluorescence punctuates colocalization was also found ( Fig. 1L-N) . These observations obviously indicate that a significant increase in the number of autophagosome-like vesicles exists in the cytoplasm of PRRSV-infected cells.\r\n Before autophagy induction, the LC3 diffusely exits in the cytoplasm as the cytosolic form-LC3-I which is about 18 kDa. At the early stages of autophagosome formation, LC3-I is converted to LC3-II which is the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugated form with a molecular mass of approximately 16 kDa; then LC3-II specifically integrates into the autophagosome membranes (Kabeya et al., 2000) . Therefore, the level of LC3-II in the total protein of cell is a reliable index to quantify the process of autophagy and the ratio of LC3-II to b-actin is regarded as an accurate index of autophagy (Klionsky et al., 2008) . Compared with the protein bands of mockinfected cells (Fig. 1O) , the MARC-145 infected cells by JXwn06 and HB-1\/3.9 both presented significant band pattern transformation, showing the bands of LC3-I gradually decreased to vanish while the bands of LC3-II gradually increased ( Fig. 1P and Q). As shown in Fig. 1R , from 24 h pi on, the difference of ratio of LC3-II\/b-actin between the JXwn06 infected cells and the mock cells was significant (po0.001) and form 72 h pi on, the difference between HB-1\/3.9 infected cells and the mock cells was also significant (po0.001) (Fig. 1O) . Meanwhile, the titer of PRRSV reached the peak at 72 h pi as well (Fig. 1S ). These results suggest there is a positive correlation between the replication of PRRSV and autophagy induction upon PRRSV infection. Taken together, our results indicate that autophagy is induced in MARC-145 cells upon PRRSV infection.\r\n To determine whether autophagy is an antiviral mechanism of host cells or utilized by PRRSV replication, we further investigated the effect of autophagy induction on the replication of PRRSV in MARC-145 cells. MARC-145 cells, prior to virus inoculation, were treated with rapamycin which can specifically induce autophagy pathway by directly inhibiting the action of mTOR (Blommaart et al., 1995; Kamada et al., 2000; Klionsky et al., 2005; Noda and Ohsumi, 1998) . Cells were harvested at indicated time points and subjected to western blotting analysis. The intracellular viruses and viruses in supernatant of cell cultures at the corresponding time points were titrated, respectively.\r\n Since no time shifting of virus replication after usage of rapamycin was detected, three time points with the same interval of virus replication were selected, which were at the early stage (24 h pi), at the peak of replication (72 h pi) and at the late stage (120 h pi) respectively. Compared with the mock-infected cells ( Fig. 2A) , the LC3 punctuates increased in the cells treated with rapamycin ( Fig. 2B ). As shown in Fig. 2C and D, the ratio of LC3-II\/b-actin, which represents autophagy level of the infected cells treated with rapamycin, was higher than that of the infected cells treated by DMSO, and from 72 h pi on, a significant difference between the two groups was observed (po0.05). The intracellular titer of PRRSV in the infected cells treated with rapamycin was higher than that in the infected cells treated with DMSO ( Fig. 2E ), which showed a significant difference (po0.01) from 72 h pi on. The virus titers in the supernatant had a similar tendency (Fig. 2F ). In order to exclude the impact of rapamycin on cell viability, cell viability was tested after treatment with rapamycin, and the results indicated that there was no significant difference on the cell viability between treated cells and mock cells (Fig. 2G ). These results suggest that autophagy enhance the replication of PRRSV.\r\n We further analyzed the effect of autophagy inhibition on the replication of PRRSV. The autophagy inhibitor-3-MA that suppresses the formation of autophagosomes without affecting protein synthesis is widely used for autophagy inhibition (Seglen and Gordon, 1982) . LC3 is necessary for the formation and maturation of autophagosome, therefore silencing LC3 will specifically block the autophagy pathway (Klionsky et al., 2008; Ohsumi, 2001) .\r\n MARC-145 cells were treated with 3-MA of different concentrations prior to infection and then inoculated with PRRSV. Since no time shifting of peak of virus replication after usage of 3-MA was detected, three time points with the same interval of virus replication were selected, which were at the early stage (24 h pi), at the peak of replication (72 h pi) and at the late stage (120 h pi) respectively. As shown in Fig. 3 MARC-145 cells were reduced compared with those in the mock treated cells. Moreover, the inhibition effect of 3-MA was dosedependent. When the cells were treated with 10 mM of 3-MA, the replication of PRRSV was almost completely suppressed. In order to exclude the impact of 3-MA on cell viability, cell viability was tested after treatment with different doses of 3-MA, and the results indicated that there was no significant difference on the cell viability between treated cells and mock treated cells (Fig. 3C ). Meanwhile the LC3 gene was knocked down using siRNAs specific for LC3b silencing. Compared with scrambled siRNA-transfected cells, the LC3 level of the cells treated with LC3-specific siRNAs was notably depleted (Fig. 3D) . At 24 h post-transfection, MARC-145 cells were inoculated with PRRSV. After inoculation for 72 h, the total titers of PRRSV were measured. The total PRRSV titer of scrambled siRNA transfected group was significantly higher than the two siLC3 groups, moreover, the more efficient a siLC3 worked the more significantly lowered the PRRSV titer of this group than scrambled siRNA group ( Fig. 3D and E) . In order to exclude the impact of LC3 silencing on cell viability, cell viability was tested after treated with siLC3s, and the results indicated that there was no significant difference on the cell viability between siLC3s-treated cells and siSCR-treated cells (Fig. 3F) . As a whole, our results further suggest that autophagy plays an important role in the replication of PRRSV. The degradation of late stage of autophagy pathway was not blocked by the replication of PRRSV and bafilomycin A1 treatment reduced PRRSV titer We next conducted this set of experiments to investigate the mutual impact of the replication of PRRSV and the degradation function of late stage of autophagy pathway. In order to determine the impact of replication of PRRSV on the degradation function of late stage of autophagy pathway, MARC-145 cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against N protein and LAMP1 and subjected to confocal microscopy at a late stage time point of 120 h pi. LAMP1 is a maker of lysosomes and acquired for fusion of autophagosomes with endosomal vesicles, thus LAMP1 is an autolysosome maker as well (Kirkegaard et al., 2004) . The result of confocal microscopy revealed punctuates accumulation of LAMP1 in the cytoplasm of the infected cells (Fig. 4E ). The N protein of PRRSV was mainly distributed nearby the cell membrane (Fig. 4D ). As shown in Fig. 4F , LAMP1 and N protein were completely colocalized. Then we detected the level of p62\/SQSTM1 of PRRSV infected and mock infected MARC-145 cells. P62\/SQSTM1 is a multifunctional protein serving as a link between LC3 and ubiquitinated substrates and specifically degraded by the autolysosomes, therefore it is considered a marker for autophagy-mediated protein degradation activity (Klionsky et al., 2008) . For the mock infected cells, p62\/SQSTM1 bands existed to the end (Fig. 4G) . For the infected cells, the p62\/SQSTM1 band rapidly decreased, and disappeared from 72 h pi on (Fig. 4H) . The results of confocal microscopy and the detection of p62\/SQSTM1 level indicated that PRRSV were colocalized with autolysosomes and the replication of PRRSV enhanced the degradation function of late stage of autophagy pathway instead of inhibiting it.\r\n On the other hand, we investigate the impact of the degradation function of late stage of autophagy pathway on the replication of PRRSV. MARC-145 cells were inoculated with PRRSV and treated with 100 nM of Bafilomycin A1, which inhibits the efficient degradation by inhibiting the autophagosome-lysosome-fusion (Klionsky and Emr, 2000; Yamamoto et al., 1998) . Then the PRRSV were tittered. As the treatment time of bafilomycin A1 prolonged, both the titers of intracellular and supernatant viruses decreased significantly (Figs. 4I and J). In order to exclude the impact of bafilomycin A1 on cell viability, cell viability was tested after treated with bafilomycin A1 and the results indicated that there was no significant difference on the cell viability between treated cells and untreated cells (Fig. 4K) . Meanwhile p62\/SQSTM1 was also detected following treatment of bafilomycin A1 on PRRSV infected MARC-145 cells to evaluate the effect of bafilomycin A1 inhibition on degradation of late stage of autophagy pathway. The accumulation of p62\/ SQSTM1 was observed as treatment of bafilomycin A1 prolonged (Fig. 4L) . Though bafilomycin may affect virus infection with an autophagy-unrelated process, this result at least showed a possibility that degradation function of late stage of autophagy pathway may be favor to the replication of PRRSV.\r\n The results of this part suggested that the degradation function of late stage of autophagy pathway was not impacted by the replication of PRRSV and bafilomycin A1 treatment reduced PRRSV titer. The absorbance at 490 nm was recorded and which of treated groups and mock group was compared with w 2 test (K). p62\/SQSTM1 was detected following treatment of bafilomycin A1 on PRRSV infected MARC-145 cells (L). The data of panels I and J were obtained in three independent experiments, and error bars mean 7SD of the three experiments (two-way ANOVA test; ns, P40.05; *Po 0.05; **P o0.01; ***P o0.001). Scale bars in panels (A)-(F) represent 10 mm.\r\n PAMs are the natural host cells of PRRSV (Duan et al., 1997; Rossow et al., 1996) , and PRRSV infection results in the destruction and function alterations of these cells (Molitor et al., 1997; Pol et al., 1997; Thanawongnuwech et al., 1997) . We also conducted some of the experiments to analyze the relationship between autophagy and PRRSV infection using PAMs. The results by western blotting showed that the LC3-II bands changed lightly in the mock-infected PAMs (Fig. 5A) ; while in the PRRSV-infected PAMs, obvious band pattern transformation occurred, from the beginning the bands of LC3-I decreased and the bands of LC3-II increased, to the end almost all LC3 was of LC3-II form at 48 h pi (Fig. 5B) . The change of LC3 was similar to the results in MARC-145 cells. Punctuates accumulation of LC3 in the infected PAMs was shown by the images of confocal microscopy ( Fig. 5C and D) . Moreover, the fluorescence punctuates of N protein were colocalized with the fluorescence punctuates of LC3 (Fig. 5E) . Obviously, these results indicate that autophagy is induced in PAMs upon PRRSV infection.\r\n The experiments reported in this paper were performed in order to provide a better understanding of the interaction between PRRSV infection and host cells, with a particular focus on the effect of host autophagy on the replication of PRRSV. In recent years, a growing number of studies have demonstrated that the infection processes of viruses are closely related with autophagy of host cells. The autophagy pathway may play an antiviral role in host cells. In Sindbis virus, studies indicated that the autophagy protein Beclin 1 could reduce neuronal apoptosis and the neuronal expression of the Beclin 1 could decrease the virus titers in Central Nervous System (CNS) (Liang et al., 1998) . In the case of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), the antiviral effect of autophagy exists as well, which degraded the proteins of the virus (Talloczy et al., 2006) . However, the viruses, such as HSV-1 and CVB3, in return evolved mechanisms to escape or hijack the autophagy pathway (Orvedahl et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2008) . Recent studies indicated that autophagy-related proteins including Beclin-1, Atg4B, Atg5 and Atg12 were required for translation of incoming viral RNA at the initiation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication (Dreux et al., 2009) , and dengue virus (DENV) infection could lead to an autophagy-dependent processing of lipid droplets and triglycerides to release free fatty acids, which is necessary for its efficient replication (Heaton and Randall, 2010) . Obviously, these studies provide valuable implications for PRRSV research. In nidoviruses including coronaviruses and arteriviruses, they might successfully subvert host autophagy to their advantage. Certain nonstructural proteins (Nsps) of nidoviruses assemble together and anchor on DMVs to form the viral RNA replication-transcription complex. Although the precise mechanism regarding the formation of the replication complexes has not been clarified yet, more and more evidence indicated that the membrane they anchored on resemble autophagosomes (Gosert et al., 2002; Snijder et al., 2001 Snijder et al., , 2006 van der Meer et al., 1998) . A recent publication indicated the Nsp6 protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, could generate autophagosomes from the endoplasmic reticulum, but it did not show the relationship between that mechanism and the replication of IBV (Cottam et al., 2011) . Direct experimental data is needed to confirm whether the DMVs on which virus replication complexes anchored are autophagosomes.\r\n PRRSV, a member of genus arterivirus, is an important pathogen for pigs. Unveiling the autophagy phenomenon induced by PRRSV infection in host cells and the role of autophagy in the replication of PRRSV is helpful for us to understand the interaction between the virus and host cell and cell pathogenesis of PRRSV. In our present study, we used MARC-145 cells-the highly permissive cells of PRRSV as the model cell line to conduct all the experiments and further performed some of experiments in PAMs-the natural target cell. We first observed the presence of morphologically characteristic double-membrane vesicles in the PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells. These vesicles were termed autophagosome-like vesicles in our paper although we do not have enough evidence to define them as autophagosomes, and the nature of the vesicles is needed to be confirmed. We further found both the N protein and the Nsp2 of PRRSV colocalized with the autophagy protein LC3 in the PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, and also the N protein of PRRSV colocalized with the autophagy protein LC3 in the PRRSV-infected PAMs by confocal microscopy. Meanwhile, we monitored the change of LC3 of both PRRSVinfected MARC-145 cells and PRRSV-infected PAMs by western blotting analyses. Our findings provide the evidence that PRRSV infection is able to induce autophagy in host cells.\r\n Manipulation of host autophagy pathway can affect the replication of some viruses. In CVB3, the inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological compounds or interference of autophagy-criticalgene with target-specific siRNA can reduce the virus production, while the induction of autophagy promotes the virus replication (Wong et al., 2008) . In order to further analyze the role of autophagy in the replication of PRRSV in MARC-145 cells, we conducted induction of autophagy by the autophagy inducer-rapamycin, and inhibition of autophagy by the inhibitor-3-MA and siRNA silencing of LC3 gene. Our results showed that the titers of PRRSV in MARC-145 cell were significantly increased resulting from autophagy induction with pharmacological compounds, whereas the inhibition of host autophagy with the inhibitor 3-MA reduced virus generation. Given 3-MA is a nucleoside analog, and it may have inhibitory effects on RNA replication, we then knocked down the LC3 gene with siRNAs to specifically block the autophagy pathway and assessed the impact of this treatment on PRRSV replication. Similar to the results of 3-MA treatment, the PRRSV titers following LC3 silencing were significantly lower. PRRSV replication was not completely stopped may be due to that LC3 gene was not totally silenced. Thus, the relationship between silencing efficiency and the virus titers indirectly indicated LC3 is helpful for PRRSV replication. Though the relationship between autophagy and the mechanism of replication of PRRSV and MHV may be different, a recent study have indicated that LC3-I is also required by MHV (Reggiori et al., 2010) , a member of coronaviruses. Our results provide another evidence for that some nidoviruses might successfully take advantage of host autophagy (or components of autophagy) for their own replication. We tried to investigate whether the manipulation of autophagy affect the release of PRRSV, we measured both the titers in supernatant and intracellular viruses. Unfortunately, no apparent difference between supernatant and intracellular viruses was found, which indicated that autophagy manipulating would not affect the release of PRRSV. It will be an interesting issue to investigate which part (s) or which gene (s) of autophagy pathway is (are) involved in the replication of PRRSV. Taken together, our data indicate that the autophagy pathway in host cells is likely hijacked by PRRSV to facilitate its replication.\r\n Autolysosomes are the functional factor of this degradation pathway, and the degradation activity plays a critical role in protecting the cell against microbes. A recent report suggested that prevention of autophasosome-lysosome-fusion by silencing LAMP2 significantly increased the expression of CVB3 protein and virus titer (Wong et al., 2008) . However, in our study, the inhibitior of autophasome-lysosome-fusion reduced the virus titers as the treatment of bafilomycin A1 prolonged. Our results were consistent with a prior paper which reported that bafilomycin A1 interfered with an early stage of virus infection (Kreutz and Ackermann, 1996) . Though there are other possibilities that bafilomycin A1 affect PRRSV spread, the results indicated that the functional autolysosomes may be helpful for PRRSV generation. On the other side more explorations are needed to explain the mechanism.\r\n PAMs are the primary target cells of PRRSV (Duan et al., 1997; Rossow et al., 1996) , and they act in diverse biological functions. They also play critical role in both innate immunity and adaptive immunity in pigs. Previous study indicated that PRRSV infection could induce apoptosis of infected PAMs as well as periphery noninfected PAMs (Labarque et al., 2003) . Understanding the cellular mechanism associated with function distortion of PRRSV-infected PAMs is helpful for controlling PRRS. Here we for the first time show that autophagy is induced in the PRRSV-infected PAMs. Additionally, emerging evidence has linked cellular autophagy with innate and adaptive immune programs. Eissa and colleagues reported that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are able to trigger the formation of autophagosomes, and silencing TLR4 resulted in significant reduction in autophagosomes (Xu et al., 2008) . Results of other groups demonstrated that IFN-g and TNF-a which belong to Th1 cytokines can up-regulate autophagy, while Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 may counteract autophagy induction (Gutierrez et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2006) . Another research group reported that the autophagy pathway may play an alternative role in the delivering cytosolic antigens for MHC-II (Brazil et al., 1997) . It is also reported that if cellular damage is too extensive and apoptosis is suppressed, the autophagy pathway which initially functions as a cytoprotective mechanism may kill the cells (Boya et al., 2005) . Considering the wide association of autophagy with other cellular pathways such as TLR pathway, antigen presentation pathway and apoptosis, our results open a new window for cracking the pathogenesis of PRRSV. These issues related to the autophagy induced by PRRSV infection are worthy to be further explored.\r\n Recently, a paper indicated the similar viewpoints that, the PRRSV infection induced autophagy; induction autophagy increased the PRRSV titer; and inhibition of autophagy reduced the PRRSV titer (Chen et al., 2012) . Our works have provided more data and in-depth analysis to confirm that PRRSV infection can induce autophagy in MARC-145 cells, and also investigated the induction of autophagy by PRRSV infection in PAMs, its natural host cells. Additionally, we further explored the relationship between the replication of PRRSV and the degradation function of late stage of autophagy pathway.\r\n To summarize, our findings for the first time indicate that autophagy is triggered in host cells upon PRRSV infection and involved in the replication of PRRSV, implying that PRRSV can utilize the autophagic pathway to sustain their own replication in host cells. Our present study is helpful for further exploring the pathogenesis related to the interaction between PRRSV and host cells.\r\n In this study, the results first indicate that autophagy is induced in MARC-145 cells upon PRRSV infection. Then the results suggest that on autophagy induction the PRRSV replication is enhanced, while reduced by the inhibition of autophagy. Next it is shown that the degradation function of late stage of autophagy pathway and the replication of PRRSV were beneficial to each other. Finally, our results indicate that autophagy is induced in PAMs upon PRRSV infection.\r\n Cells of the MARC-145 line, a highly permissive for PRRSV replication, were used in this study. The cells were maintained in GIBCO TM Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen Corporation, Auckland, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone Laboratories Inc, South Logan, UT) at 37 1C, with 5% CO 2 . Porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were prepared with 4-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) piglets (Beijing Center for SPF Swine Breeding and Management), according to the methods previously described (Wensvoort et al., 1991; Zhang et al., 2009) . The PAMs were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCO, Invitrogen Corporation, CA) containing 10% FBS, 100 units\/mL of penicillin, and 100 mg\/ml of streptomycin at 37 1C, with 5% CO 2 . The PRRSV stock used in this study was the fifth passage culture of PRRSV JXwn06, a high-virulence PRRSV strain and the fifth passage culture of HB-1\/3.9, a low-virulence PRRSV strain (Zhou et al., 2009) . The titers of the virus were determined as the tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID 50 ) per milliliter by using the Reed-Muench method. Briefly, MARC-145 cells cultivated in 96-well plates were inoculated with the virus dilutions (100 ml\/well) prepared by serial 10-fold dilution. After absorption for 1 h at 37 1C, the suspensions in the wells were removed, and DMEM with 10% FBS was added to the wells. Plates were incubated for an additional 72-96 h; virus titers were determined by the presence of a visible CPE.\r\n Monoclonal antibodies (McAb) against N protein and nonstructural protein 2 (Nsp2) of PRRSV used in this study were prepared by our laboratory (Gu et al., 2000; Yan et al., 2007) . Primary antibodies specific for LC3, p62\/SQSTM1 and LAMP1, as well as anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies, were purchased from Sigma (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The inducer-rapamycin, the inhibitor-3-methyladenine (3-MA) of autophagy, and the autophagosomelysosome-fusion inhibitor-bafilomycin A1 were also purchased from Sigma.\r\n MARC-145 cells cultured in 6-well cell culture cluster (Costar, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 in DMEM with 10% FBS. For autophagy induction, cells were treated with 1 mM of rapamycin dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide for 3 h prior to virus infection. For autophagy inhibition experiments, cells were treated with different concentrations of 3-MA dissolved in glycerol for 24 h prior to virus inoculation. For autophagosome-lysosome-fusion inhibition, cells were treated with 100 nM of bafilomycin A1 at different time points following virus infection. PAMs were incubated for 12 h at 37 1C in 5% CO 2 in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS, and the non-adherent cells were removed by gentle washing with RPMI-1640 medium prior to inoculation. Then, the cells were inoculated with 0.05 of MOI of PRRSV.\r\n Cell viability was assayed with CellTiter 96 s AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kits (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 1 \u00c2 10 5 MARC-145 cells per well were seeded in a 96-well cell plate and cultured for 48 h at 37 1C with 5% CO 2 . Then, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 3-MA (0.1 mM, 1 mM or 10 mM) or bafilomycin A1 (100 nM) and incubated for 24 h. 20 ml of CellTiter 96 s AQueous One Solution was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37 1C. The absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using a 96-well plate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.).\r\n Cells were plated in 96-well plates, then were infected with PRRSV or treated with reagents at 37 1C in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Following incubation of 1 h, the inoculums were removed and replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS. At the indicated time points, the cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and fixed with 95% pre-chilled ethanol for 15 min. For confocal microscopy experiments, all primary antibodies against the proteins of PRRSV were derived from mouse, and all primary antibodies against cellular autophagic proteins were derived from rabbits. The primary antibodies were diluted with PBS containing 5% FBS (pH 7.4), and were adsorbed for 1 h at 37 1C and then washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4). For each experiment group, the cells were stained with McAb to N protein plus anti-LC3 antibodies, McAb to Nsp2 plus anti-LC3 antibodies, or McAb to N protein plus anti-LAMP1 antibodies, respectively. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 1C with a 1:100 dilution of anti-rabbit and\/or anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to tetraethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) or fluorescein isocyanate (FITC). Cells were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4). Finally, the cells were immediately visualized at 488 nm and 543 nm under a Nikon TE-2000E confocal fluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY).\r\n The MARC-145 cells in flasks (Corning Inc., NY) were mockinfected or PRRSV-infected for 72 h. Then the cells were washed once with PBS (pH 7.4) and scraped. Following pelleted at 600g for 10 min, the cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and stored at 4 1C overnight. For subsequent processing, the cells were washed in 1 M PBS, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at room temperature. Then the samples were dehydrated in a series of graded acetone, and embedded in Spurr's plastic resin, polymerized overnight. Ultrathin sections were cut with Leicauc 6i section cutter, and were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then examined and imaged under a JEM-1230 electron microscope.\r\n Treated or infected cells at indicated time pointes were digested with trypsin. The cells were collected and washed with PBS (pH 7.4) three times, then centrifugated at 600g for 6 min at 4 1C. Ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton x-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% Sodium Deoxycholate, 50 mM Sodium fluoride, 5 mM Sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM DTT] with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany) was added to the cell pellets. Sample tubes were incubated on ice for 15 min, sonicated at 30% duty cycle with 3 output control for 10 pulses, and centrifugated at 16,000g for 20 min. The supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes and stored at \u00c0 80 1C for western blotting.\r\n Sets of siRNA used in this study for silencing LC3b were obtained from Ambion. Two days after seeding, the MARC-145 cells were transfected with 20 pmol of siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Corporation, Auckland, NY). At 24 h post-transfection, experiments were conducted. The depletion of the targeted gene was detected by western blotting with antibodies against LC3. The same treatments were conducted with the scrambled siRNA as a negative control.\r\n Cell lysate samples, diluted in RIPA buffer, were heated at 100 1C for 5 min and loaded on 20% (w\/v) SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to Polyvinylidene Fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocked with 5% separated milk dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4) at 4 1C overnight. Membranes were reacted with primary antibodies and then with corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Protein bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) by the ECL plus Western Blot Detection System (Kodak, NY). Images were captured using GelDoc XR (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and adjusted for total brightness and contrast with Adobe Photoshop CS3.

The autophagy pathway is regulated under various GTPases, kinases and phosphatases. Autophagy is not only necessary for cellular homeostasis, but also plays an important role in other physiological and pathological processes (Levine and Kroemer, 2008; Mizushima, 2007) , as well as in both adaptive immunity and innate immunity (Levine and Deretic, 2007; Menendez-Benito and Neefjes, 2007) . In recent years, a number of studies have revealed the direct interaction between autophagy and viral infection. In coronaviruses, it has been demonstrated that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) can utilize part of autophagy to replicate or the autophagy mechanism to enhance their replication (de Haan and Reggiori, 2008; Prentice et al., In the present study, we demonstrated that autophagy can be induced in the permissive MARC-145 cells and the natural host cell-pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) upon PRRSV infection, and meanwhile investigated the role of autophagy in the replication of PRRSV. 1A) , while the PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells exhibited massive doublemembrane vesicles and single-membrane vesicles around the perinuclear region (termed as autophagosome-like vesicles) (Fig. By confocal microscopy analyses, it was indicated that the PRRSV-infected cell presented significant enhancement of LC3 signals with the fluorescence punctuates accumulation (Fig. 1F) , and the fluorescence punctuates of N protein were highly colocalized with the fluorescence punctuates of LC3 (Fig. Thus Nsp2 can be used as a marker of replication units on some degree. Compared with the protein bands of mockinfected cells (Fig. 1R , from 24 h pi on, the difference of ratio of LC3-II\/b-actin between the JXwn06 infected cells and the mock cells was significant (po0.001) and form 72 h pi on, the difference between HB-1\/3.9 infected cells and the mock cells was also significant (po0.001) (Fig. Cells were harvested at indicated time points and subjected to western blotting analysis. The intracellular viruses and viruses in supernatant of cell cultures at the corresponding time points were titrated, respectively. 2A) , the LC3 punctuates increased in the cells treated with rapamycin ( Fig. We further analyzed the effect of autophagy inhibition on the replication of PRRSV. LC3 is necessary for the formation and maturation of autophagosome, therefore silencing LC3 will specifically block the autophagy pathway (Klionsky et al., MARC-145 cells were treated with 3-MA of different concentrations prior to infection and then inoculated with PRRSV. When the cells were treated with 10 mM of 3-MA, the replication of PRRSV was almost completely suppressed. In order to exclude the impact of 3-MA on cell viability, cell viability was tested after treatment with different doses of 3-MA, and the results indicated that there was no significant difference on the cell viability between treated cells and mock treated cells (Fig. Meanwhile the LC3 gene was knocked down using siRNAs specific for LC3b silencing. After inoculation for 72 h, the total titers of PRRSV were measured. In order to determine the impact of replication of PRRSV on the degradation function of late stage of autophagy pathway, MARC-145 cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against N protein and LAMP1 and subjected to confocal microscopy at a late stage time point of 120 h pi. The accumulation of p62\/ SQSTM1 was observed as treatment of bafilomycin A1 prolonged (Fig. The results of this part suggested that the degradation function of late stage of autophagy pathway was not impacted by the replication of PRRSV and bafilomycin A1 treatment reduced PRRSV titer. The data of panels I and J were obtained in three independent experiments, and error bars mean 7SD of the three experiments (two-way ANOVA test; ns, P40.05; *Po 0.05; **P o0.01; ***P o0.001). Scale bars in panels (A)-(F) represent 10 mm. PAMs are the natural host cells of PRRSV (Duan et al., 5A) ; while in the PRRSV-infected PAMs, obvious band pattern transformation occurred, from the beginning the bands of LC3-I decreased and the bands of LC3-II increased, to the end almost all LC3 was of LC3-II form at 48 h pi (Fig. The autophagy pathway may play an antiviral role in host cells. A recent publication indicated the Nsp6 protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, could generate autophagosomes from the endoplasmic reticulum, but it did not show the relationship between that mechanism and the replication of IBV (Cottam et al., PRRSV, a member of genus arterivirus, is an important pathogen for pigs. In CVB3, the inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological compounds or interference of autophagy-criticalgene with target-specific siRNA can reduce the virus production, while the induction of autophagy promotes the virus replication (Wong et al., In order to further analyze the role of autophagy in the replication of PRRSV in MARC-145 cells, we conducted induction of autophagy by the autophagy inducer-rapamycin, and inhibition of autophagy by the inhibitor-3-MA and siRNA silencing of LC3 gene. PRRSV replication was not completely stopped may be due to that LC3 gene was not totally silenced. Though the relationship between autophagy and the mechanism of replication of PRRSV and MHV may be different, a recent study have indicated that LC3-I is also required by MHV (Reggiori et al., Our results provide another evidence for that some nidoviruses might successfully take advantage of host autophagy (or components of autophagy) for their own replication. Autolysosomes are the functional factor of this degradation pathway, and the degradation activity plays a critical role in protecting the cell against microbes. On the other side more explorations are needed to explain the mechanism. 1996) , and they act in diverse biological functions. Additionally, emerging evidence has linked cellular autophagy with innate and adaptive immune programs. Finally, our results indicate that autophagy is induced in PAMs upon PRRSV infection. The cells were maintained in GIBCO TM Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen Corporation, Auckland, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone Laboratories Inc, South Logan, UT) at 37 1C, with 5% CO 2 . After absorption for 1 h at 37 1C, the suspensions in the wells were removed, and DMEM with 10% FBS was added to the wells. Primary antibodies specific for LC3, p62\/SQSTM1 and LAMP1, as well as anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies, were purchased from Sigma (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). MARC-145 cells cultured in 6-well cell culture cluster (Costar, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 in DMEM with 10% FBS. For autophagy inhibition experiments, cells were treated with different concentrations of 3-MA dissolved in glycerol for 24 h prior to virus inoculation. The primary antibodies were diluted with PBS containing 5% FBS (pH 7.4), and were adsorbed for 1 h at 37 1C and then washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4). Finally, the cells were immediately visualized at 488 nm and 543 nm under a Nikon TE-2000E confocal fluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY). Following pelleted at 600g for 10 min, the cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and stored at 4 1C overnight. At 24 h post-transfection, experiments were conducted. The same treatments were conducted with the scrambled siRNA as a negative control. Membranes were reacted with primary antibodies and then with corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Protein bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) by the ECL plus Western Blot Detection System (Kodak, NY).

Primary cultures of alveolar epithelial cells are an important model for the early events in viral infection that lead to pulmonary inflammation.","text_body":"The large surface area of the alveolar epithelium makes it an important interface between respiratory pathogens and the host. Alveolar type I cells, which make up 95% of this surface area, are terminally differentiated and function in gas exchange and fluid homeostasis (Williams, 2003) . Alveolar type II cells are dividing cells that transdifferentiate in vivo into the type I cell phenotype during the repair of damaged alveolar epithelium. Type II cells also produce surfactant proteins and lipids, which keep the alveoli expanded and function in innate defense of the lung (Evans et al., 1975; Mason, 2006) . Epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract initiate pulmonary inflammation in response to pollutants, allergens, or infectious agents (Martin et al., 1997) .\r\n Bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar type II cells express and secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to infection with respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, and the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) Yen et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2001) . The role of alveolar type I cells in immune responses to viral infection is largely unknown.\r\n Coronaviruses are an important cause of respiratory infections of animals, humans, and birds. Five coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory disease in humans. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 229E and OC43 are etiologic agents of the common cold and can cause more serious lower respiratory tract disease in elderly or immunocompromised patients (Birch et al., 2005; Pene et al., 2003) . Infection with SARS-CoV was associated with an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002-2003 that had a case fatality rate of \u223c10% (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Tsui et al., 2003) . HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are recently identified coronaviruses that are associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract diseases in children and adults Kuypers et al., 2007; Pyrc et al., 2007; Van der Hoek et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005) . Coronaviruses also cause respiratory diseases in rats, dogs, cows, pigs, and poultry (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005) .\r\n Several strains of rat coronavirus (RCoV) have been isolated from the lungs of rats with clinical or subclinical infections (Compton et al., 1999; Kojima and Okaniwa, 1991; Parker et al., 1970) . The two prototype strains of RCoV have different tissue tropisms and disease associations in rats. Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) causes disease primarily in the upper respiratory tract, salivary and lacrimal glands, and eyes (Bhatt et al., 1972; Jacoby et al., 1975) . SDAV has also been isolated from the lower respiratory tract and can cause mild interstitial pneumonia in young rats (Wojcinski and Percy, 1986) . In contrast, Parker's RCoV (RCoV-P) has only been isolated from the respiratory tract and causes fatal pneumonia in suckling rats (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1977; Parker et al., 1970) . In adult rats inoculated intranasally with RCoV-P, virus replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Neutrophils are observed in the nasal cavity, trachea, and alveoli on days 2-5, followed by infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lung on day 5 after infection. RCoV-P infection of adult rats causes interstitial pneumonia and focal edema in the alveoli, which resolves by day 8 after infection (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1977) . As with RCoV-P, upon intranasal inoculation of adult rats with SDAV, neutrophils are the primary infiltrating cell type in the respiratory epithelium early in infection (Jacoby et al., 1975; Wojcinski and Percy, 1986) . RCoV is an important model in which to study the pathogenesis of pulmonary infection caused by a coronavirus in its natural host. Here we examine the role of alveolar type I cells in the innate immune response to rat coronavirus infection.\r\n Primary cultures of rat alveolar epithelial cells are a wellcharacterized model of differentiated lung epithelium, which have not been studied previously with respect to viral infection . Alveolar type II cells isolated from rat lung can be cultured in vitro to either maintain the type II cell phenotype or transdifferentiate into the type I cell phenotype (Dobbs et al., 1985 (Dobbs et al., , 1988 Mason et al., 2002; Nishina et al., 2005) . Because alveolar type I cells are difficult to isolate at a high yield and purity, transdifferentiated type II cells are used as a model to study the characteristics and functions of type I cells in vitro (Borok et al., 1998a; Dobbs et al., 1985; Williams, 2003) . After 3-5 days in culture on plastic in the absence of rat serum and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), rat alveolar type II cells change in morphology from a cuboidal to a flattened shape, and have decreased expression of surfactant proteins and lamellar bodies and increased expression of the type I cell markers, T1\u03b1, aquaporin V, and caveolin-1 (Borok et al., 1998a (Borok et al., , 1998b Danto et al., 1995; Manzer et al., 2006; Mason et al., 2002) .\r\n In this study, cultures of rat alveolar type I cells were evaluated for susceptibility to RCoV infection, and for expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to RCoV inoculation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the in vitro response of rat alveolar epithelial cells to infection with a rat virus. Two strains of RCoV, RCoV-P and SDAV, caused productive infection of alveolar type I cells. Infection of type I cell cultures with these coronaviruses increased expression and secretion of CXC chemokines, CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX, which are important neutrophil chemoattractants. Secretion of these chemokines was also induced by UV-inactivated viruses, showing that viral replication was not required for the induction of chemokine expression. Dual immunolabeling of viral antigen and CXC chemokines showed that expression of CXC chemokines was primarily from uninfected cells in these cultures. Virus-induced chemokine expression was reduced by IL-1 receptor antagonist, but not soluble TNF receptor, indicating that IL-1 produced by infected cells may induce chemokine expression from the uninfected type I cells. These data suggest that alveolar type I cells can secrete chemokines in response to viral infection, which may lead to infiltration of neutrophils into the lung.\r\n Rat coronavirus strains RCoV-P and SDAV infect primary cultures of rat alveolar type I cells Type I cells infected with RCoV-P showed mild cytopathic effects including cell rounding and vacuolation at 24 h after inoculation ( Fig. 1 ). Type I cells infected with SDAV had more pronounced cytopathic effects including syncytia formation and cell detachment. No cytopathic effects were observed in mockinoculated type I cell cultures. At 24 h after virus inoculation, viral nucleocapsid protein was detected in type I cells inoculated with RCoV-P or SDAV, but not in mock-inoculated cells. Culture media from type I cells inoculated with RCoV-P or SDAV were collected at various times after inoculation and titrated by plaque assay. RCoV-P and SDAV replicated with similar kinetics in alveolar type I cells (Fig. 2) . Infectious virus was first detected in the supernatant medium by 12 h after inoculation, and reached a maximum titer of 10 5 -10 6 PFU\/ml at 24 h.\r\n Culture media from type I cells collected 6 h or 24 h after inoculation with sucrose density gradient purified RCoV-P or SDAV were assayed for the presence of 19 rat cytokine and chemokine proteins by protein macroarray analysis (Fig. 3) . At 6 h after inoculation, both RCoV-P-and SDAV-inoculated type I cells showed increased secretion of the chemokines CINC-2, CINC-3 (CXCL-2\/3, MIP-2), fractalkine (CX 3 CL-1), GM-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, LIX (CXCL-5), Leptin, and MIP-3\u03b1 (CCL20), compared to mock-inoculated cells. By 24 h after inoculation, CINC 2, CINC-3, fractalkine, LIX, MIP-3\u03b1, and TNF-\u03b1 were increased in cultures that were inoculated with each of these viruses. Infection of type I cells with SDAV increased the expression of several other cytokines, including IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, compared to mock or RCoV-P inoculated cultures.\r\n Because CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX are closely related CXC chemokines that are expressed by rat alveolar epithelial cells in response to LPS or cytokines (Jeyaseelan et al., 2005; Manzer et al., 2006; Nishina et al., 2005; Vanderbilt et al., 2003) , we further quantified their expression and secretion in RCoVinfected type I cells. The expression of CXC chemokines, CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX, was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA (Fig. 4) . Infection of type I cells with RCoV-P or SDAV induced expression of mRNA encoding CINC-2\u03b1, CINC-3, and LIX at 6 h and 24 h after inoculation (Fig. 4A ). Infection with RCoV-P or SDAV also induced secretion of CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX proteins by 6 h after inoculation (Fig. 4B) . Secretion of the CXC proteins increased further at 24 h and 48 h after inoculation. The ELISA for CINC-2 did not differentiate between CINC-2\u03b1 and CINC-2\u03b2, whereas the probe used in RT-PCR was specific for CINC-2\u03b1. Rat alveolar type I cells do not express CINC-2\u03b2 constitutively or in response to cytokines or ozone (Nishina et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006) .\r\n To determine whether viral replication was required to induce CXC chemokine expression, we inactivated the infectivity of RCoV-P and SDAV by UV irradiation. Inactivation of virus infectivity was confirmed by plaque assay of the UVtreated viral inoculum or medium from type I cells 24 h after exposure to UV-treated virus, in comparison to untreated virus. The titers of UV-treated RCoV-P and SDAV were below the limit of detection of our plaque assay (11.1 PFU\/ml). Alveolar type I cells exposed to UV-treated virus for 24 h did not express viral nucleocapsid protein ( Fig. 1 ), but nevertheless induced secretion of CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX compared to mockinoculated type I cells (Fig. 5 ). There was no difference in the amount of CXC chemokines secreted from type I cells treated with UV-inactivated virus compared to cells treated with infectious virus (p b 0.05).\r\n To determine whether the CXC chemokine response to infectious or UV-inactivated RCoV-P or SDAV was specific for the rat coronaviruses, we inoculated rat alveolar type I cells with a related group 2a coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 that had been purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. No viral antigen was detected by immunolabeling at 24 h after inoculation of type I cells with MHV-A59, and the expression of CXC chemokines CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX was not increased compared to mock-inoculated cells (data not shown).\r\n To determine whether the increase in CXC chemokine expression in alveolar type I cell cultures was limited to virusinfected cells, at 16 h after virus inoculation type I cell cultures were treated with brefeldin A for 6 h before dual immunolabeling of viral nucleocapsid protein and CXC chemokines (Fig. 6 ). Brefeldin A inhibits export of secreted proteins from the distal Golgi to the cell surface (Miller et al., 1992) . As expected from the ELISA data, cultures of type I cells that had been inoculated with RCoV-P or SDAV had increased immunolabeling with CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX antibodies compared to mock inoculated cultures. CINC-2 and LIX were much more brightly labeled than CINC-3 (data not shown), corresponding to the concentrations of protein detected by ELISA (Fig. 4B) . The majority of cells that were positive for CXC chemokine expression did not express viral nucleocapsid protein. Therefore, the ELISA data showing increased chemokine secretion in RCoV-infected type I cell cultures is mostly from uninfected cells. These data suggest that RCoVs induce CXC chemokine expression in type I cell cultures through an indirect mechanism.\r\n Signaling through the IL-1 receptor, but not the TNF receptor, promotes SDAV-induced CXC chemokine expression in rat alveolar type I cells To test the hypothesis that a paracrine factor secreted from infected cells induces CXC chemokine expression in uninfected cells in the culture, we analyzed the ability of antagonists for the IL-1 and TNF receptors to block the CXC chemokine response. The IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) binds strongly to the IL-1 type I receptor, thereby preventing signal transduction by IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Dinarello, 1996) . The TNF soluble receptor protein (TNFsrp) binds to both soluble and membrane-bound forms of TNF-\u03b1, thereby inhibiting their activity (Dinarello, 2005) . Treatment of SDAV-inoculated cells with IL-1ra decreased the level of CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX secretion when it was added to type I cells prior to inoculation and maintained in the medium throughout infection with SDAV (Fig. 7) . The presence of TNFsrp had no effect on the chemokine secretion during SDAV infection of type I cells. When both IL-1ra and TNFsrp were present during SDAV infection, the levels of CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX expression were the same as levels from cells that were treated with IL-1ra alone. These data suggest that IL-1 that is secreted from infected alveolar type I cells induces expression of CXC chemokines in uninfected cells in the culture.\r\n Although type I cells make up 95% of the surface area of the alveolar epithelium, their role in the pathogenesis of respiratory virus infections and in innate immunity is largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the ability of rat coronaviruses to infect rat alveolar type I cells in vitro. Despite differences in tissue tropism and disease association in vivo, two strains of RCoV were able to infect primary alveolar epithelial cells in vitro. We showed that infection of alveolar type I cells with either RCoV-P or SDAV induced expression of chemokines, CINC-2, CINC-3, LIX, MIP-3\u03b1, and fractalkine at both 6 h and 24 h after inoculation. Our protein array analysis also identified cytokines that are increased in SDAV-infected, but not RCoV-P-infected, alveolar type I cell cultures. This differential cytokine response may play a role in the different pathogenesis of RCoV-P and SDAV infections in vivo. Fractalkine, the sole member of the CX 3 C chemokine family, is predominately a membrane-bound chemokine and functions in the recruitment and adhesion of cytotoxic lymphocytes to endothelial cell surfaces (Stievano et al., 2004) . MIP-3\u03b1, which is chemotactic for dendritic cells, B cells, and memory T cells, is expressed by human bronchial epithelial cells in response to inflammatory mediators IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (Starner et al., 2003) .\r\n Previous studies showed that alveolar type II cells express CXC chemokines both constitutively and in response to treatment with cytokines, LPS, or acid and infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( 2005; Mason, 2006; Nishina et al., 2005; Vanderbilt et al., 2003) . Our study contributes to the growing body of data that supports a role for alveolar type I cells in chemokine expression Wang et al., 2006) . CXC chemokines are important mediators of neutrophil chemotaxis and immunopathology associated with respiratory virus infections (Londhe et al., 2005; Tumpey et al., 2005; Turner, 1990; Yen et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2001) . Therefore, we further quantified the expression of CXC family members CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX made by rat alveolar type I cells in response to RCoV infection by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA. Levels of CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX mRNAs and secreted proteins were increased in RCoVinfected type I cell cultures. CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX are closely related CXC-ELR + chemokines that are similar to IL-8\/ CXCL8 in humans (Shibata et al., 1995; Smith et al., 2002) . CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX specifically bind and signal through CXCR2, a seven transmembrane domain receptor expressed on rat type II alveolar cells, endothelial cells, and neutrophils (Chandrasekar et al., 2003; Dunstan et al., 1996; Shibata et al., 2000; Vanderbilt et al., 2003) . Neutrophil chemotaxis and activation are the primary functions of CXCR2 signaling. However, CXCR2 also mediates cellular proliferation and morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and wound healing (Devalaraja et al., 2000) . CXC chemokines secreted from infected alveolar epithelial cells could potentially signal through CXCR2 on type II pneumocytes to stimulate type II cell proliferation and transdifferentiation into the type I cell phenotype, resulting in repair of damaged epithelium. Expression of CXCR2 and secretion of CXC chemokines are upregulated in alveolar type II cells by lung injury (Vanderbilt et al., 2003) . In addition, CINC-1 signaling through CXCR2 on type II cells promotes alveolar development in newborn rats that are exposed to hyperoxic conditions (Auten et al., 2001) . CXC chemokine signaling through CXCR2 on alveolar type II cells and endothelial cells may also promote retraction of these cells, which would promote increased migration of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells into the alveoli (Schraufstatter et al., 2001) . Although CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX signal through the same receptor, they may have some distinct functions during viral infection. For example, although CINC-2 and CINC-3 have similar neutrophil chemotactic activity, CINC-3 induces greater calcium mobilization than CINC-2, resulting in increased neutrophil activation (Shibata et al., 2000) . Further studies are needed to elucidate the roles of CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX in the innate immune response to RCoV infection in vivo.\r\n The production of CXC chemokines by alveolar epithelial cells during viral infection is probably responsible for the recruitment of neutrophils to the infected alveoli, an early event in a variety of respiratory viral infections. Respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), induce expression of CXC chemokines, which results in an influx of neutrophils into the respiratory tract (Abu-Harb et al., 1999; Tumpey et al., 2005; Turner, 1990; Wang et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2001; Zhu et al., 1997) . Infiltration of neutrophils into lung and other tissues occurs soon after infection with coronaviruses including rat coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus strains 1 and JHM, and SARS-CoV, and has been implicated in both immunopathology and virus clearance (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1977; De Albuquerque et al., 2006; Haagmans et al., 2004; Iacono et al., 2006; Tsui et al., 2003; Yen et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2003) . After intranasal inoculation of adult rats with RCoV-P, neutrophils are found in the upper respiratory tract on day 2 and in the lung on day 5, corresponding to the presence of viral antigen and histological lesions (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1977) . Neutrophils are also the earliest infiltrating cell type in the respiratory epithelium after intranasal inoculation with SDAV (Jacoby et al., 1975; Wojcinski and Percy, 1986) . The role of neutrophils in RCoV clearance and immunopathology is not yet known. Primary cultures of alveolar epithelial cells are an important model in Fig. 5 . UV-inactivated viruses induce secretion of chemokines from alveolar type I cells. Type I cells were inoculated with RCoV-P or SDAV, mockinoculated, or treated with UV-inactivated RCoV-P or SDAV (see Fig. 1 ). Media were harvested 24 h after treatment and chemokine secretion was analyzed by ELISA. Asterisks ( * ) indicate significant difference from mock-inoculated cells, p b 0.05. Data are average values of duplicate samples from 3 experiments. which to study the early events in viral infection that lead to pulmonary inflammation.\r\n Like infection with RCoV-P or SDAV, other UV-inactivated viruses also induce expression of CXC chemokines. UV-inactivated murine coronavirus, MHV-4 variant V5A13.1, induces expression of CXC and CC chemokine genes in primary mouse astrocyte cultures and in the CNS of infected mice during acute and chronic phases of CNS disease (Lane et al., 1998) . UVinactivated RSVor soluble viral glycoproteins (F and G proteins) induce expression of IL-8 in A549 cells (Tirado et al., 2005) . Our data show that a component of purified virions that was not destroyed by UV light was responsible for inducing chemokine expression. The viral hemagglutinin esterase glycoprotein (HE) was not required for the induction of CXC chemokines because SDAV virions do not contain HE (Gagneten et al., 1996; Miura and Holmes, unpublished observation) . Perhaps interaction of the viral spike glycoprotein with as yet unknown cellular receptor(s) triggers chemokine expression, as SARS-CoV spike protein does in A549 cells (Chang et al., 2004) . Alternatively, other viral structural proteins may induce expression of chemokines (Law et al., 2007; Tirado et al., 2005) . For several RNA viruses, dsRNA replicative intermediates induce chemokine expression (Hewson et al., 2005; Imaizumi et al., 2004; Londhe et al., 2005) . However, this is unlikely to be the case for RCoV because viral replication was not required for chemokine expression.\r\n Viral infection can induce chemokine expression either by a direct or indirect mechanism (Melchjorsen et al., 2003) . In our RCoV-infected type I cell cultures, dual immunolabeling of viral antigen and CXC chemokines demonstrated that the CXC Fig. 6 . Virus infection induces expression of chemokines from uninfected type I cells in the culture. Type I cells were treated with brefeldin A 16 h after inoculation with SDAV and fixed 6 h later. Fixed cells were immunolabeled for expression of viral nucleocapsid protein (red) and CINC-2 or LIX (green). Nuclei were stained blue with DAPI. Representative fields from duplicate experiments are shown. Fig. 7 . There is decreased expression of CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX in SDAV-infected type I cells that have been treated with IL-1ra. Type I cells were treated with IL-1ra, TNFsrp, or both proteins and inoculated with SDAV. After 1 h, the inoculum was removed, cells were rinsed and refed with medium with or without the indicated receptor antagonists. After 18 h the media were analyzed for CXC chemokines by ELISA. Asterisks (*) indicate a statistically significant difference between SDAVinfected cells without receptor antagonist treatment and SDAV-infected cells with receptor antagonist treatment (p b 0.05). Data are representative of duplicate experiments with triplicate samples. chemokines were expressed principally in cells that did not express viral nucleocapsid protein. This suggests that RCoV infection of alveolar type I cells can indirectly induce expression of chemokines in uninfected cells. Infected cells may release a soluble factor such as IL-1 or TNF-\u03b1, which could stimulate nearby cells to express and secrete CXC chemokines Nishina et al., 2005) . To test this hypothesis, we inoculated type I cells with SDAV in the presence of antagonists for the IL-1 and\/or TNF receptors, IL-1ra and TNFsrp, respectively. Treatment with IL-1ra, but not TNFsrp, decreased CXC chemokine secretion from SDAVinfected cultures (Fig. 7) . Thus, signaling through the IL-1 receptor contributes to the induction of CXC chemokine expression in SDAV-infected type I cell cultures.\r\n IL-1ra blocks signaling of both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 through the IL-1 receptor (Dinarello, 1996) . IL-1 is important in the induction of CXC chemokines in lung cells in vitro and in vivo. Both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induce expression and secretion of CXC chemokines in primary cultures of rat alveolar type I and type II cells Nishina et al., 2005;  Unpublished observations). Furthermore, IL-1 receptor knockout mice have a decreased neutrophil response to influenza infection, likely due to decreased IL-1-dependent expression of CXC chemokines (Schmitz et al., 2005) .\r\n A potential limitation of this study is that we isolated type II cells and transdifferentiated them into a type I-like cell phenotype in vitro Wang et al., 2006) . While transdifferentiated type I cells express T1\u03b1 and many other type I cell markers, are morphologically like type I cells, and secrete MIP-2 and MCP-1 in response to LPS and IL-1, they may not express all of the genes expressed in freshly isolated type I cells (Gonzalez et al., 2005; Manzer et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006) . Although we think that it is unlikely, it is possible that type I cells in vivo will respond differently to viral infection.\r\n Animal models to evaluate the mechanisms of viral induction of chemokines in the lung are valuable in studying viral pathogenesis and designing treatments for viral diseases. The expression of chemokines in SARS patients has been correlated with increased disease severity (Tang et al., 2005) . SARS pathogenesis has been studied in rodent models: aged mice, SARS-CoV adapted to cause disease in rodents, or transgenic mice that express the SARS receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (McCray et al., 2007; Nagata et al., 2007; Roberts et al., 2007 Roberts et al., , 2005 Tseng et al., 2007) . We are studying rat coronaviruses as a model for respiratory coronavirus infection in the natural host of the virus. The study of other rodent viruses in their natural hosts has advanced the understanding of other respiratory viral pathogens, such as Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice as models for human parainfluenza and RSV respectively (Faisca and Desmecht, 2007; Rosenberg et al., 2005) . Recently the MHV-1 strain of murine coronavirus was shown to induce severe respiratory disease in mice and was proposed as a model for SARS-CoV (De Albuquerque et al., 2006) . Primary cultures of rat alveolar epithelial cells will be a valuable model for dissecting the viruscell interactions and innate immune responses that are important in the critical early steps in pulmonary infection of a virus in its natural host.\r\n Isolation and culture of alveolar epithelial cells Alveolar type II cells were isolated from 6-8-week-old, specific pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) as previously described (Dobbs and Mason, 1979; Manzer et al., 2006) . Briefly, type II cells were dissociated from rat lung with porcine pancreatic elastase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) and were partially purified on discontinuous Optiprep (Axis-Shield Poc As, Oslo, Norway) density gradients. Cells were plated on plastic tissue culture dishes in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 2.5 ug\/ml amphotericin B, 100 ug\/ml streptomycin, and 100 ug\/ml penicillin G, and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 10% CO 2 . Culture of type II cells on plastic in DMEM containing 5% FBS for 3-5 days results in trans-differentiation into the type I cell phenotype, characterized by loss of expression of surfactant proteins, gain of expression of T1\u03b1 and aquaporin V, and changes in morphology and lectin-binding specificities (Borok et al., 1998a (Borok et al., , 1998b Danto et al., 1995; Dobbs et al., 1985; Manzer et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006) .\r\n RCoV-P and SDAV were obtained from Dr. D. Percy (University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario) (Percy et al., 1991) . Viruses were propagated in a subclone of murine L929 cells, L2P-41.a (Gagneten et al., 1996) , purified by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation as previously described, and stored in TMS buffer (25 mM Tris, 25 mM maleic acid, 100 mM NaCl, pH 6.5) with 5% glycerol (Sturman et al., 1980) . Viral titers were determined by plaque assay on L2P-41.a cells (described below). Purified virus was diluted in DMEM to achieve equivalent doses of RCoV-P and SDAV for inoculation. For experiments with UV-inactivated viruses, the diluted viruses were exposed on ice to UV irradiation in a Stratalinker UV Crosslinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at a cumulative dose of 120 mJ\/cm 2 . Inactivation of virus was demonstrated by plaque assay of the UV-irradiated virus and medium from type I cells 24 h after inoculation with the UV-irradiated virus, as well as by immunofluorescent detection of viral antigens in type I cells 24 h after inoculation with the UV-irradiated virus, using a cross-reactive mAb to the mouse hepatitis virus nucleocapsid protein (described below). These analyses confirmed that the infectivity of the RCoVs was completely eliminated by this UV treatment. UV-irradiated viral inocula were shown to be free of bacterial contamination by inoculation of blood agar and incubation at 37\u00b0C.\r\n Primary alveolar epithelial cells were cultured as described above for 5 days to obtain a type I cell phenotype, then inoculated with RCoV-P, SDAV, UV-inactivated RCoV-P or SDAV, or mock inoculated. After a 1 h adsorption period, the cells were washed twice with DMEM, refed with DMEM\/5% FBS and antibiotics, and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 10% CO 2 . For mock inoculation of alveolar type I cells, TMS buffer with 5% glycerol was diluted in DMEM at the same ratio as the virus inoculum. Twenty-four hours after inoculation, type I cells on coverslips were fixed in methanol\/acetic acid (3:1). Viral nucleocapsid antigen was detected using a monoclonal antibody to mouse hepatitis virus nucleocapsid protein (kindly provided by Dr. J. Leibowitz, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX) that cross-reacts with RCoV nucleocapsid protein, followed by a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). At intervals after inoculation, media from inoculated cultures were collected for viral titration, cytokine protein arrays and ELISAs. Total cellular RNA was extracted for quantification of chemokine mRNA as described below. For experiments with receptor antagonists, IL-1ra (10 ug\/ml), TNFsrp (10 ug\/ml), neither antagonist, or both IL-1ra and TNFsrp were added to type I cells 30 min prior to inoculation with SDAV. The concentration of antagonist was maintained in the culture throughout the 18 h infection. IL-1ra and TNFsrp were kindly provided by Dr. Charles Dinarello (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO).\r\n Stocks of purified virus or medium from virus infected cultures was serially diluted in DMEM without FBS and used to inoculate triplicate wells of near confluent L2P-41.a cells. After a 1 h adsorption period at 37\u00b0C, the inoculum was removed and the cells were overlaid with MEM, 4% FBS, antibiotics, and 0.5% SeaKem LE agarose (Cambrex, Rockland, ME). Plaques were stained after 72 h incubation at 37\u00b0C, with the agarose overlay medium containing 6% neutral red (Sigma-Aldrich).\r\n Type I cells were inoculated with RCoV-P or SDAV, or were mock-inoculated as described above. Media from type I cells were collected 24 h after inoculation, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and incubated with membranes spotted with antibodies specific for 19 rat cytokines and chemokines (RayBiotech, Inc., Norcross, GA). The membranes were processed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The membranes were exposed to X-ray film and the film was scanned for densitometry analysis using Kodak Molecular Imaging Software (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY). Densitometry data were normalized to internal positive controls on each membrane and graphed as relative units.\r\n Total RNA was isolated from alveolar epithelial cells using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Reverse transcription and TaqMan PCR (Applied Bioscience) were performed on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system as previously described , using published primer pairs and fluorogenic probes for CINC-2\u03b1 , CINC-3 (Nishina et al., 2005) , and LIX (Jeyaseelan et al., 2005) . The mRNA expression levels of CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX were normalized to the level of GAPDH mRNA for each sample, using a commercially available rat GAPDH kit (Applied Bioscience).\r\n Media from RCoV-inoculated or mock-inoculated alveolar type I cells were harvested 6, 24, and 48 h after inoculation for the measurement of CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX by ELISA. ELISA assays were developed by ELISAtech (Aurora, CO) using standards and antibodies from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The CINC-2\u03b2 antibody (R&D Systems) used in the ELISA shows significant cross-reactivity to CINC-2\u03b1, hence the product of this ELISA is referred to as CINC-2. Chemokine levels were quantified by comparison of values with that of a standard curve for each chemokine. The reported values are averages \u00b1 standard error of the mean of at least three independent experiments with two replicate wells per experiment. The chemokine concentrations were compared between samples using one-way ANOVA. P values were computed using the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test.\r\n Type I cells were inoculated with RCoV-P or SDAV, or were mock-inoculated. After 18 h, a protein transport inhibitor that contained brefeldin A (BD GolgiPlug, BD Biosciences) was added to the culture medium as recommended by the manufacturer. Six hours later, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich). Viral nucleocapsid protein was detected using a monoclonal antibody to MHV nucleocapsid (described above) followed by an Alexafluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen). CXC chemokines were detected with goat antibodies (R&D Systems) to rat LIX (AF543), CINC-3 (AF525), or CINC-2\u03b1 (AF516) followed by an Alexafluor 488-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (Invitrogen).","sha":"3f07732b7e9102b06aaf566c7bc7398617d453c4","publish_time":"2007-12-20","authors":"Miura, Tanya A.; Wang, Jieru; Holmes, Kathryn V.; Mason, Robert J.","journal":"Virology","doi":"10.1016\/j.virol.2007.07.030","Title":"Virology","H index":162.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"The large surface area of the alveolar epithelium makes it an important interface between respiratory pathogens and the host. The role of alveolar type I cells in immune responses to viral infection is largely unknown. Coronaviruses are an important cause of respiratory infections of animals, humans, and birds. Five coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory disease in humans. 1999; Kojima and Okaniwa, 1991; Parker et al., The two prototype strains of RCoV have different tissue tropisms and disease associations in rats. Alveolar type II cells isolated from rat lung can be cultured in vitro to either maintain the type II cell phenotype or transdifferentiate into the type I cell phenotype (Dobbs et al., After 3-5 days in culture on plastic in the absence of rat serum and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), rat alveolar type II cells change in morphology from a cuboidal to a flattened shape, and have decreased expression of surfactant proteins and lamellar bodies and increased expression of the type I cell markers, T1\u03b1, aquaporin V, and caveolin-1 (Borok et al., To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the in vitro response of rat alveolar epithelial cells to infection with a rat virus. Infection of type I cell cultures with these coronaviruses increased expression and secretion of CXC chemokines, CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX, which are important neutrophil chemoattractants. Type I cells infected with SDAV had more pronounced cytopathic effects including syncytia formation and cell detachment. At 24 h after virus inoculation, viral nucleocapsid protein was detected in type I cells inoculated with RCoV-P or SDAV, but not in mock-inoculated cells. Because CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX are closely related CXC chemokines that are expressed by rat alveolar epithelial cells in response to LPS or cytokines (Jeyaseelan et al., The ELISA for CINC-2 did not differentiate between CINC-2\u03b1 and CINC-2\u03b2, whereas the probe used in RT-PCR was specific for CINC-2\u03b1. Inactivation of virus infectivity was confirmed by plaque assay of the UVtreated viral inoculum or medium from type I cells 24 h after exposure to UV-treated virus, in comparison to untreated virus. To determine whether the increase in CXC chemokine expression in alveolar type I cell cultures was limited to virusinfected cells, at 16 h after virus inoculation type I cell cultures were treated with brefeldin A for 6 h before dual immunolabeling of viral nucleocapsid protein and CXC chemokines (Fig. The IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) binds strongly to the IL-1 type I receptor, thereby preventing signal transduction by IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Dinarello, 1996) . Treatment of SDAV-inoculated cells with IL-1ra decreased the level of CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX secretion when it was added to type I cells prior to inoculation and maintained in the medium throughout infection with SDAV (Fig. These data suggest that IL-1 that is secreted from infected alveolar type I cells induces expression of CXC chemokines in uninfected cells in the culture. Expression of CXCR2 and secretion of CXC chemokines are upregulated in alveolar type II cells by lung injury (Vanderbilt et al., CXC chemokine signaling through CXCR2 on alveolar type II cells and endothelial cells may also promote retraction of these cells, which would promote increased migration of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells into the alveoli (Schraufstatter et al., Respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), induce expression of CXC chemokines, which results in an influx of neutrophils into the respiratory tract (Abu-Harb et al., After intranasal inoculation of adult rats with RCoV-P, neutrophils are found in the upper respiratory tract on day 2 and in the lung on day 5, corresponding to the presence of viral antigen and histological lesions (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1977) . Primary cultures of alveolar epithelial cells are an important model in Fig. UV-inactivated viruses induce secretion of chemokines from alveolar type I cells. Asterisks ( * ) indicate significant difference from mock-inoculated cells, p b 0.05. UV-inactivated murine coronavirus, MHV-4 variant V5A13.1, induces expression of CXC and CC chemokine genes in primary mouse astrocyte cultures and in the CNS of infected mice during acute and chronic phases of CNS disease (Lane et al., UVinactivated RSVor soluble viral glycoproteins (F and G proteins) induce expression of IL-8 in A549 cells (Tirado et al., Our data show that a component of purified virions that was not destroyed by UV light was responsible for inducing chemokine expression.

After 18 h the media were analyzed for CXC chemokines by ELISA. Data are representative of duplicate experiments with triplicate samples. chemokines were expressed principally in cells that did not express viral nucleocapsid protein.

It causes an economically important disease, resulting in an estimated $560 million loss per year to the swine industry in the United States (Neumann et al., 2005) . PRRSV is known to inhibit the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) in infected pigs (Albina et al., 1998; Buddaert et al., 1998) . IFNs are not detectable in the lungs of pigs, in which PRRSV actively replicates. PRRSV-infected pigs develop delayed and low titer neutralizing antibodies (Labarque et al., 2000) and weak cell-mediated immune responses (Xiao et al., 2004) . Suppression of innate immunity may be an important contributing factor to PRRSV modulation of host immune responses.\r\n PRRSV can be propagated in vitro in an epithelial-derived monkey kidney cell line, MARC-145 (Kim et al., 1993) , and in primary cultures of porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). PAMs are the main target cells for PRRSV during its acute infection of pigs (Rossow et al., 1995) . PRRSV infection of PAM and MARC-145 cells in vitro leads to a very low expression of interferon-a (IFN-a) for viral strains studied to date (Albina et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2004) .\r\n Type I IFNs, such as IFN-a and -b, are critical to innate immunity against viral infection and contribute to the modulation of adaptive immunity (Takaoka and Yanai, 2006) . The innate immune system is activated after cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRR) sense pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of invading pathogens. Host PRRs for RNA viruses include Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Activation of the TLR or RLR pathways eventually leads to the secretion of type I IFNs. The binding of type I IFNs to their receptors activates the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, which induces expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and results in the establishment of an antiviral state (Darnell et al., 1994; Schindler and Darnell, 1995; Stark et al., 1998) .\r\n Some PRRSV strains suppress IFN-b expression in MARC-145 cells and PRRSV non-structural proteins (nsp) 1, 2, 4, and 11 inhibit IFN induction when over-expressed (Beura et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2010; . PRRSV can also inhibit IFN downstream signaling and expression of ISGs in both MARC-145 and PAM cells (Patel et al., 2010) . The nuclear translocation of STAT1\/STAT2\/IRF9 heterotrimers was blocked in PRRSV-infected cells, while the IFNinduced phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 was not affected. Many efforts to control PRRS have been attempted, but few are successful because of the antigenic and genomic diversity among PRRSV isolates, and persistence of the virus in infected herds. Attenuated live virus vaccines have been commercially available for years; however, outbreaks of PRRS resulting from viral strains nearly identical in sequence to the vaccine strain have been reported (Botner et al., 1997; Opriessnig et al., 2002) . Outbreaks of atypical or acute PRRS in vaccinated pigs have raised serious concern about the efficacy and safety of the current vaccines (Madsen et al., 1998; Meng, 2000) .\r\n In the present study, we discovered a PRRSV isolate that induced production of type I IFNs in both MARC-145 and PAM cells and appeared to have an undetectable inhibitory effect on the ability of IFN-a to induce an antiviral response. Its infection of PAMs led to an undetectable cytopathic effect. Characterization of this unique isolate will be beneficial to the study of PRRSV-cell interactions and the development of improved vaccines.\r\n In studying PRRSV interference of IFN signaling, we discovered one PRRSV cell culture isolate that did not inhibit IFN signaling but induced antiviral activity in MARC-145 cells. After plaque purification of this isolate three times, one plaque was named A2MC2.\r\n Vero cells are not susceptible to PRRSV infection and were used as an indicator cell line for our studies. NDV-GFP is sensitive to type I IFNs, so pre-treatment of Vero cells with IFN-a inhibited NDV-GFP replication and was included as an assay control. Treatment of Vero cells with dilutions of A2MC2-infected MARC-145 cell culture supernatant reduced the number of NDV-GFP-positive cells (Fig. 1A) , which indicated that the NDV replication was inhibited. This result suggested the existence of type I IFNs in the culture supernatant of the A2MC2-infected cells.\r\n To further confirm that the antiviral activity was due to interferons, Western blot analysis was conducted to assess the protein levels of interferon-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56) and STAT2, in Vero cells. Blotting results showed that both ISG56 and STAT2 were elevated after treatment with the cell culture supernatant from A2MC2-infected MARC-145 cells (Fig. 1B) . The levels of the proteins were similar to those of cells treated with 1000 U\/ml IFN-a. These results suggested that A2MC2 induced synthesis of type I IFNs in MARC-145 cells.\r\n PRRSV is known to inhibit production of type I IFNs. To confirm that A2MC2 is a genuine PRRSV isolate, an inhibition assay was performed by using antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO), 5UP1, which inhibits replication of PRRSV in MARC-145 cells in a sequence-specific manner (Zhang et al., 2006) . A scrambled control PPMO CP1 was included as a negative control. An indirect immunofluorescence assay showed that 5UP1 blocked A2MC2 replication in MARC-145 cells (Fig. 1C) , while CP1 had no effect. The lysate of A2MC2-infected MARC-145 cells was used for Western blot analysis with pig antiserum against PRRSV. Lysate samples of VR-2385-and MLVinfected cells were included as controls. Blotting results showed that A2MC2-infected cells had a band profile similar to MLV, though the bands were at a weaker intensity (Fig. 1D) . The difference in band pattern between VR-2385 and MLV is likely because there is a deletion in nsp2 of VR-2385 (Ni et al., 2011) . These results confirmed that A2MC2 was a strain of PRRSV. Genotyping of this isolate was then performed.\r\n RT-PCR was conducted for the whole A2MC2 RNA genome. Sequencing of the cDNA was done and sequence analysis showed that it closely resembles Ingelvac PRRS MLV (GenBank ID: AF066183) and VR-2332 (GenBank ID: U87392), strains of genotype 2 PRRSV, at identity of 99.8%. There were a total of 28 nucleotide (nt) variations when compared to VR-2332, resulting in 14 amino acid changes (Supplementary Table 1 ). The nucleotide variations are scattered from nt 4681 to the end of the genome (Fig. 2 ). The first 4680 nucleotides are identical to VR-2332. There were a total of 34 nucleotide variations when compared to strain MLV, resulting in 19 different amino acids. Compared to both VR-2332 and MLV, A2MC2 has 15 unique nucleotides scattered from nt 4681 to the end of the genome (Fig. 2) . Ten of the unique changes are between nt 4681 and nt 10037 of the A2MC2 genome. The sequence from nt 11667 to 14420 of A2MC2 is the same as VR-2332 except 4 unique nucleotide variations. The sequence from nt 14421 to the end of the A2MC2 genome is the same as MLV except 1 unique nucleotide variation. At the amino acid level, the A2MC2 differences when compared to VR-2332 were located in nsp3, nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp11, nsp12, GP3, and M; and the variations from MLV sequence were located in nsp1b, nsp2, nsp8, nsp10, nsp11, nsp12, GP2, GP3, GP5, and M (Supplementary Table 1 ). Six unique amino acid changes occurred in A2MC2 when compared to VR-2332 and MLV: threonine to serine in nsp8, serine to alanine and proline to leucine in nsp10, serine to glycine in nsp12, methionine to valine, and isoleucine to valine in GP3 (Table 1) . Nsp10 is a RNA helicase that unwinds dsRNA (Bautista et al., 2002) , while the functions of nsp8 and nsp12 are unknown. GP3 is a glycoprotein found in PRRSV virions as a minor structural component (de Lima et al., 2009) . The genomic sequence of A2MC2 when compared to both that of VR-2332 and MLV indicated that A2MC2 was possibly a chimera derived from these two strains.\r\n To determine the growth properties of A2MC2 in MARC-145 cells, a multi-step growth curve analysis was conducted. The cells were inoculated at a MOI of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 TCID 50 per cell, respectively. Cell culture supernatant samples were collected daily for five days after the inoculation and titrated for virus yield. The cells inoculated with 0.01 TCID 50 per cell had the highest virus yield, 10 6.67 TCID 50 per ml on day 3, while the cells inoculated with 1 TCID 50 per cell had the lowest yield, lower than 10 3 (Fig. 3A) . The virus yields of cells with 0.01 TCID 50 increased from 10 3 on day 1 to 10 6.67 on day 3, and remained at 10 6 on day 5. The virus yield of cells with 1 TCID 50 per cell decreased from 10 3.5 on day 1 to 10 2.5 on day 5. The virus yields of cells with 0.01 TCID 50 on day 3, 4 and 5 were significantly higher than those from cells with 0.01 and 1 TCID 50 .\r\n To further characterize the growth properties of A2MC2, plaque assays were conducted in comparison with VR-2385 and MLV strains. MARC-145 cells were inoculated with A2MC2, VR-2385, and MLV, respectively. Plaques were observed on 4 dpi after neutral red staining. The A2MC2-infected cells resulted in a small plaque morphology at around less than 1 mm in diameter, similar to VR-2385, while cells infected with MLV revealed a plaque morphology at around 5 mm in diameter, which was at least 5 times larger than those of A2MC2 (Fig. 3B ). This result indicated that A2MC2 replication in MARC-145 cells was different from that of MLV.\r\n To test if A2MC2 caused cytopathic effects (CPE) after infection of PAM cells, as it does in MARC-145 cells, we inoculated primary PAMs with PRRSV at the MOI of 0.05 TCID 50 per cell and observed the cells at 20 hpi under bright field microscopy. A2MC2 infection of PAMs caused no observable CPE, while VR-2385 and NVSL led to cell death (Fig. 3C ). A2MC2-infected cells appeared similar to MLV-infected or uninfected PAM cells in morphology. A cell viability assay was conducted to assess the relative viability level between treatments. A2MC2-infected PAM cells showed a similar viability rate as was seen in uninfected cells, as did MLV infection, while VR-2385 significantly reduced viability to 0.14-fold (Fig. 3D ). This result was consistent with the CPE observed under bright field microscopy.\r\n To determine virus yield in PAMs, cell culture supernatant was collected at 24 hpi and titrated in MARC-145 cells by IFA. The virus yields of A2MC2, MLV, VR-2385, and NVSL were 10 3.8 , 10 3.6 , 10 5.2 , and 10 4.4 TCID 50 per ml, respectively (Fig. 3E) . The results showed that viral yields of A2MC2 and MLV were significantly lower than VR-2385 (Po0.05), but did not vary much from the viral yield of NVSL.\r\n To determine if A2MC2 replication induces IFN-stimulated genes in MARC-145 cells, the cells were infected with the virus at 1 TCID 50 per cell and harvested at 24 h post-infection (hpi). Western blot analysis showed that the levels of STAT2 and ISG56 in MARC-145 cells were remarkably elevated after A2MC2 infection ( to induce the elevation of these two proteins, indicating that the elevation was A2MC2 replication-dependent. Real-time RT-PCR was conducted to detect the transcripts of IFN-b, ISG15, and ISG56 in MARC-145 cells. Compared to mocktreated control wells, A2MC2 infection at 1 TCID 50 per cell induced 422-, 73-, and 509-fold RNA elevations of IFN-b, ISG15, and ISG56, respectively (Fig. 4B) . The IFN-b transcript in A2MC2infected cells was 105-fold higher than that of IFN-a-treated PRRSV-negative cells. The average levels of ISG15 and ISG56 transcripts in A2MC2-infected cells without external IFN-a were 1.68-and 1.6-fold, respectively, lower than those in IFN-a-treated PRRSV-negative cells. The differences of ISG15 and ISG56 between the A2MC2-infected and the IFN-a-treated uninfected cells were statistically insignificant. Addition of IFN-a to A2MC2-infected cells did not lead to a significant increase in expression of these three genes, compared to A2MC2-infected cells without external IFN-a.\r\n As different MOI led to variable virus yields in MARC-145 cells, the protein levels of STAT2 and ISG56 in the cells after infection with different MOIs were assessed. Western blotting showed that the greater the MOI that was used to infect MARC-145 cells, the higher the level of STAT2 and ISG56 at 24 hpi detected (Fig. 4C) . By 48 hpi, the cells with 0.1 TCID 50 had similar levels of these two proteins to 1 TCID 50 . By 72 hpi, the cells with 1 TCID 50 had the lowest level of these two proteins. The results indicated that the high MOI inoculum was able to induce early synthesis of the two proteins, while a low MOI led to delayed induction.\r\n To compare A2MC2 with other PRRSV strains in regards to IFN induction, MARC-145 cells were inoculated with A2MC2, VR-2385, NVSL, MLV, and VR-2332 at 1 TCID 50 per cell, separately. These strains were selected because they are frequently used in this laboratory, because VR-2385 (Halbur et al., 1995; Meng et al., 1994) , VR-2332 (Benfield et al., 1992) , and NVSL (Kwon et al., 2006) are PRRSV strains of varying virulence in experimentally infected pigs, and Ingelvac PRRS MLV is a licensed modified live vaccine strain. Cell culture supernatant samples were collected at 24 hpi and used to treat Vero cells for the IFN bioassay. Supernatants from A2MC2-infected cells inhibited NDV-GFP replication in Vero cells, while supernatant samples from MARC-145 cells infected with VR-2385, VR-2332, NVSL or MLV had no effect on NDV-GFP propagation in Vero cells (Fig. 5A) .\r\n Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that A2MC2 induced an 820-fold elevation of IFN-b transcripts in MARC-145 cells, significantly higher than that induced by VR-2385, VR-2332, NVSL, or MLV (Fig. 5B) . Western blot analysis showed that VR-2385, VR-2332, NVSL, and MLV infection had no effect on STAT2 and ISG56 protein level, while A2MC2 infection led to a higher amount of the two proteins (Fig. 5C) .\r\n ELISA was done to detect IFN level in culture supernatants of MARC-145 cells infected with A2MC2, VR-2385, VR-2332, or MLV, respectively. Due to paucity of ELISA kits for type I IFNs of monkeys, only the level of monkey IFN-a2 was quantified. The level of IFN-a2 in culture supernatant of A2MC2-infected cells was 46.6 pg\/ml and significantly higher than the supernatants of MARC-145 cells infected with VR-2385, VR-2332 or MLV (Fig. 5D) . These results indicated that A2MC2 induced synthesis of type I IFNs in MARC-145 cells, while the other four PRRSV strains inhibited IFN induction.\r\n To further examine the expression of IFN-b in A2MC2-infected MARC-145 cells, the cells were harvested at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hpi for RNA isolation and real-time RT-PCR. The IFN-b mRNA increased from 2-fold at 2 hpi to 474-fold at 24 hpi (Fig. 6A) . The large increase of IFN-b transcripts started at 8 hpi. This result indicates that IFN-b expression increased concurrently with A2MC2 replication. Viral RNAs at these time points were detected by real-time RT-PCR. The results showed that the viral RNAs detected at 8, 10, 12 and 24 hpi were 3.2-, 2.3-, 4.2-, and 2.5-fold, respectively, higher than 2 hpi (Fig. 6B) . The relatively small increase in the viral RNA level is consistent with the result of the multi-step growth curve showing limited virus replication in cells inoculated with 1 TCID 50 per cell.\r\n The data above showed that A2MC2 induced expression of type I IFNs. We were interested in the status of JAK-STAT signaling pathway in A2MC2-infected cells. STAT1 and STAT2 proteins are key players in JAK-STAT signaling, a pathway activated by type I IFNs (Darnell et al., 1994; Schindler and Darnell, 1995; Stark et al., 1998) . Phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 is an early step in the pathway after IFNs bind to their receptors. To determine if A2MC2-induced IFNs resulted in the activation of these two proteins, we tested the phosphorylation status of STAT1 and STAT2 in MARC-145 cells at 0, 9, 16 and 24 hpi. The selection of 9 hpi was based on the speculation that after increase of IFN-b transcript at 8 hpi, phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 would be detected. The inclusion of 16 and 24 hpi was based on the speculation that along with the increase of IFN-b expression, phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 would continue. The result showed that the levels of phosphorylated STAT1 at tyrosine 701 (STAT1-Y701) and STAT2 at tyrosine 690 (STAT2-Y690) were greatly increased at 9 hpi (Fig. 6C) , indicating A2MC2-induced IFNs led to the activation of STAT1 and STAT2. Moreover, the total STAT2 and ISG56 were detectable at 9 hpi and increased at 16 and 24 hpi (Fig. 6C ). This result suggested that A2MC2-induced IFNs resulted in the activation of JAK-STAT signaling, which then led to the increased expression of STAT2 and ISG56.\r\n PAMs are the main target cells for PRRSV infection in vivo. To determine the effect of A2MC2 on IFN synthesis in PAM cells, PAMs were infected with A2MC2 and harvested for Western blot analyses at 20 hpi. Infections of PAMs with VR-2385 and MLV were included as controls. Compared to uninfected cells, A2MC2 infection resulted in the elevation of STAT2 and IFI56 (equivalent to ISG56 in primates), while VR-2385 led to no change of these two proteins, and MLV led to a slight elevation of STAT2 (Fig. 7A) . To test the effect of these virus strains on IFN signaling, IFN-a was added to PAMs at 12 hpi. PAMs infected with A2MC2 and MLV had elevated STAT2 and IFI56 to a similar level of uninfected cells treated with external IFN-a, while VR-2385-infected cells had no increase in STAT2 and IFI56 levels (Fig. 7A ). This result indicated that A2MC2 and MLV had an undetectable effect on IFN downstream signaling while VR-2385 inhibited the IFN activation in PAMs. The IFN bioassay was conducted to assess IFNs in culture supernatant of A2MC2-infected PAMs. CRL2843 cells are immortalized porcine alveolar macrophages that are not susceptible to PRRSV infection (Weingartl et al., 2002) . The cells were treated with dilutions of the supernatant from A2MC2-infected PAMs and, on the next day, inoculated with NDV-GFP. The supernatant dilutions up to 1:8 inhibited NDV-GFP replication, compared with mock-infected cells (Fig. 7B ). This result indicated To determine if the induction of IFNs by A2MC2 is not limited to PAMs from one piglet, PAMs from three other piglets were inoculated with A2MC2 and incubated for 20 h. Western blot analysis showed that A2MC2 infection induced the elevation of STAT2 in PAM cells from all three other piglets (Fig. 7C) . The level of STAT2 in A2MC2-infected PAMs was similar to that in PAMs treated with external IFN-a.\r\n Many PRRSV strains are known to inhibit the production of type I IFNs in cultured cells and in infected pigs. A2MC2 induces the synthesis of interferons in MARC-145 and primary PAM cells, and will be useful in studying PRRSV interference with host innate immune responses. In this study, the induction of IFNs by A2MC2 was examined from several aspects. First, the culture supernatant from A2MC2-infected MARC-145 cells protected Vero cells from NDV infection. Vero cells are defective in IFN production and not susceptible to PRRSV. Pretreatment of the cells with dilutions of A2MC2-derived supernatant induced an antiviral response in Vero cells that inhibited the replication of NDV. The result was corroborated by elevation of STAT2 and ISG56, two genes stimulated by IFN signaling in Vero cells.\r\n Second, the elevated expression of STAT2 and ISG56 was shown in A2MC2-infected MARC-145 cells. Virus replication was essential for the elevation of the two proteins because UVinactivated virus and PPMO inhibition of PRRSV replication did not lead to elevation of these host proteins. The results suggested that viral replication in the cytoplasm stimulated PRRs, leading to IFN synthesis. The elevation of the transcripts of ISG15 and ISG56 further confirmed the observation. This result also ruled out the possibility of contamination by other swine pathogens because PPMO-mediated inhibition of A2MC2 led to an absence of IFN induction. Other common swine pathogens, such as porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) or swine influenza virus (SwIV), can induce synthesis of a high level bioactive IFN-a (Van Reeth et al., 1999) . Interestingly, A2MC2 infection at different MOIs induced variable levels of ISG expression. The higher the MOI, the earlier A2MC2 induced ISG elevation. The lower the MOI, the later the virus-induced ISG expression and the lower level of induction. This result provided an explanation as to why an MOI of 1 TCID 50 per cell led to a lower virus yield than MOIs of 0.1 and 0.01 TCID 50 . It indicates that the inoculum of 0.01 TCID 50 per cell resulted in limited initial virus replication, leading to a weaker stimulation on cellular PRRs, which allowed the virus to complete its replication cycles. On the other hand, the inoculum at 1 TCID 50 per cell stimulated a more robust response in regards to PRRs and IFN synthesis, which in turn inhibited virus spread to neighboring cells or continued replication.\r\n Third, several other PRRSV strains including the vaccine strain MLV were shown to inhibit IFN production. IFN-a2 was detected in culture supernatant from A2MC2-infected cells, but not in the samples from cells infected with VR-2332, VR-2385, or MLV. It was possible that there were other subtypes of type I IFNs in the supernatant from A2MC2-infected cells, as IFN-b mRNA level significantly increased. We further tested IFN production in A2MC2 infection of PAM cells. The STAT2 and IFI56 were elevated in A2MC2-infected cells, but not in VR-2385-infected cells. The A2MC2 induction of IFNs was pig-independent as PAMs isolated from three other pigs had similar elevations of STAT2 after A2MC2 infection. Infection of PAMs with MLV also led to a slight elevation in STAT2 level, which indicates that MLV might induce STAT2 albeit at much lower levels than A2MC2.\r\n Analysis of the cDNA sequence of the A2MC2 genome showed that it was highly homologous to both VR-2332 and MLV. This result indicated that A2MC2 might be a chimera of VR-2332 and MLV strains. Based on sequence analysis, we reasoned that the first 4.6 kb and the fragment from nt 11966 to 14420 were derived from VR-2332; fragments of nt 10697 to 11666 and nt 14421 to the end of the genome were possibly of MLV origin; and the fragment of nt 4681 to 10037 was derived from either one of them, but with mutations as 10 unique changes are located in this fragment. Compared to both VR-2332 and MLV, A2MC2 possessed 6 unique amino acids distributed in nsp8, nsp10, and nsp12, and GP3. Based on this sequence comparison, future experiments on virus mutagenesis using reverse genetic technology will be conducted to pinpoint the A2MC2 sequences that are involved in the loss of inhibition of IFN production.\r\n Both A2MC2 and MLV have an undetectable effect on the ability of IFN-a to induce an antiviral response, as their infection of PAM cells did not affect expression of STAT2 and IFI56 activated by external IFN-a. This result is consistent with a previous report that virulent strain VR-2385 inhibits IFN signaling while MLV does not (Patel et al., 2010) . The plaque morphology of A2MC2 was much smaller than that of MLV, which indicated that MLV replicated with faster kinetics than A2MC2 in MARC-145 cells. In addition, A2MC2 infection did not lead to any observable cytopathic effect in PAM cells, and A2MC2-infected cells were of similar viability as mock-infected or MLV-infected cells. These features indicated that like MLV, A2MC2 might be less suitable to replicate in PAMs. The well-characterized cellular PRRs for IFN production during virus infection include the TLR and RLR pathways. Activation of either the TLR or the RLR pathway leads to the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), followed by its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of type I IFNs. We tested if A2MC2 replication led to IRF-3 phosphorylation using polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), as a positive control. The phosphorylated IRF-3 was detected in the poly(I:C)-treated cells but undetectable in cells infected with A2MC2 (data not shown). The result that A2MC2 infection led to increase of IFN-b transcript from 8 hpi to less than 1000-fold at 24 hpi (Fig. 6) indicated that A2MC2 replication might lead to a low level of IRF-3 signaling for an extended period. The reason for this conjecture is that poly(I:C) treatment led to over a 10,000-fold induction of IFN-b transcript with a peak at 6 h after treatment (data not shown). The continuous detection of phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT2 in A2MC2-infected MARC-145 cells from 9 to 24 hpi supports this speculation, while stimulation with external IFN-a leads to transient increase of phosphorylation of STAT1 that was reduced below the detection level after 2.5 h treatment (Patel et al., 2010) .\r\n In conclusion, we have discovered a strain of PRRSV, A2MC2, that induced IFN production in both MARC-145 and PAM cells while other tested PRRSV strains inhibited IFN induction. Specifically, A2MC2 induced type I IFNs and led to an elevation of IFNstimulated genes. Full genome sequence analysis showed that A2MC2 was closely related to VR-2332 and MLV. The identification of A2MC2 as an IFN-inducer may be beneficial for studying PRRSV interference in IFN signaling, and developing improved vaccines for protective immunity against PRRS.\r\n MARC-145 (Kim et al., 1993) and Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Immortalized porcine macrophages (CRL2843) were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Primary PAM cells were prepared from bronchoalveolar lavage of 4-week-old PRRSVnegative piglets. The preparation and subsequent culture of PAMs in RPMI1640 culture medium were conducted, as previously described (Patel et al., 2008) . PRRSV strains A2MC2, VR-2385, NVSL 97-7895, and Ingelvac PRRS MLV were used to inoculate MARC-145 cells at 1 multiplicity of infection (MOI). Virus titers were determined in MARC-145 cells for the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ), as previously described (Zhang et al., 2006) . Avirulent LaSota Newcastle disease virus carrying the gene of green fluorescence protein (NDV-GFP) was propagated in Vero cells, as previously described (Kim and Samal, 2010) .\r\n Virus inactivation was conducted with a UV cross-linker (Spectrolinker XL-1500, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) at 1200 mJ\/cm 2 for two 10-min pulses at 1-min interval. The inactivation was confirmed by the absence of virus replication in MARC-145 cells at 72 h post-infection (hpi) as assessed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA).\r\n For interferon stimulation, universal type I IFN-a (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added to the cultured cells at a final concentration of 1000 U\/ml. The cells were harvested at indicated time points for further analysis.\r\n Vero cells were seeded into cell culture plates, incubated overnight, and, on the next day, treated with culture supernatant from PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells. The cells were infected with LaSota NDV-GFP 12 h after the treatment. Fluorescence microscopy was conducted 24 h after infection to observe GFPpositive cells.\r\n An IFA was carried out as previously reported with an N-specific monoclonal antibody EF11 to detect PRRSV N-proteins in MARC-145 cells on coverglass slips (Zhang et al., 1998) . Specific reactions between EF11 and the N-protein were detected with goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The coverglass was mounted onto slides using SlowFade Gold antifade reagent containing 4 0 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) and observed under fluorescent microscopy.\r\n Cell lysate samples were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis as described previously (Zhang et al., 2007) . Briefly, separated proteins from SDS-PAGE were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with antibodies against STAT2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), b-tubulin (Sigma), phospho-STAT2 (STAT2-Y690) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-STAT1 (STAT1-Y701) (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and ISG56 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). The chemiluminescent signal was recorded digitally by Quantity One Program, Version 4.6, in a ChemiDoc XRS imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Pig antiserum against PRRSV NVSL strain (NVSL, Ames, IA) was used to detect PRRSV proteins in lysate of PRRSV-infected cells (Patel et al., 2010) .\r\n Total RNA was isolated from MARC-145 and PAM cells with TRIzol s Reagent (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription and real-time PCR were conducted as previously described (Patel et al., 2008 (Patel et al., , 2009 ). Transcripts of ribosomal protein L32 (RPL32) were also amplified from the samples of PAM and MARC-145 cells and used to normalize the total input RNA. Primers used in this study to conduct reverse transcription and real-time RT-PCR were previously described (Patel et al., 2010) . Relative transcript levels were quantified by the 2 \u00c0 DDCT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 ) and shown as a relative fold of change in comparison with mock-treated control.\r\n Viability of PAMs was determined with CellTiter-Glo Cell Viability Assay (Promega). Briefly, CellTiter-Glo reagent was added to cells in a 96-well plate and the luminescence signal was measured with VICTOR3 TM Multilabel Counter (Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Wellesley, MA). Relative percentages of luminescence intensity were calculated by comparison to controls.\r\n Plaque assays were done with modifications from a previously described protocol (O'Reilly et al., 1992) . MARC-145 cells were seeded into 35 mm culture dishes and incubated overnight. PRRSV was diluted in a ten-fold series and added to the cells. The virus inoculum was removed 2 h after inoculation and replaced with 0.5% agarose overlay containing complete growth medium. The cells were stained with another layer of agarose overlay containing neutral red at 50 mg\/ml 4 days after inoculation. Plaques were observed after overnight incubation.\r\n Culture supernatant samples of MARC-145 cells infected with A2MC2, VR-2385, VR-2332, or MLV at a MOI of 1 TCID 50 per cell were collected at 24 hpi. Detection of IFN-a2 in each sample was done by using VeriKine TM Cynomolgus\/Rhesus Interferon-Alpha Serum ELISA kit (PBL InterferonSource, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The concentration of IFN-a2 in the samples was calculated on the basis of a standard curve prepared from supplied IFN-a2 in the kit.\r\n A2MC2 genomic RNA was isolated from cell culture supernatant with TRIzol LS reagent (Life Technologies). Reverse transcription of the viral RNA with primers 32nsp12R1 (5 0 -TCAATTCAGGCCTAAAGTTG-3 0 ) and P6-7-R (5 0 -CGCCCTAATTGAA-TAGGTGACTT-3 0 ) was done with Maxima reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). PCR amplification was done with Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolab, Ipswich, MA). 5 0 -RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) and 3 0 -RACE of the A2MC2 genome were done as previously described (Sambrook and Russell, 2001) . Sequencing of the PCR products was performed with ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies). Sequence assembly and analysis was done with LaserGene Core Suite (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). The GenBank accession number of the cDNA sequence of the A2MC2 genome is JQ087873.\r\n Differences in indicators between treatment samples, such as cellular RNA level between the groups in the presence or absence of PRRSV infection, were assessed by the Student t-test. A twotailed P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.","sha":"dba47e99edf34300bd7253a1467b30aa8f8e4405","publish_time":"2012-10-25","authors":"Nan, Yuchen; Wang, Rong; Shen, Meiyan; Faaberg, Kay S.; Samal, Siba K.; Zhang, Yan-Jin","journal":"Virology","doi":"10.1016\/j.virol.2012.05.015","Title":"Virology","H index":162.0,"transmission_indicator":true,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Arteriviridae (Faaberg et al., It causes an economically important disease, resulting in an estimated $560 million loss per year to the swine industry in the United States (Neumann et al., 1993) , and in primary cultures of porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). PAMs are the main target cells for PRRSV during its acute infection of pigs (Rossow et al., Activation of the TLR or RLR pathways eventually leads to the secretion of type I IFNs. The binding of type I IFNs to their receptors activates the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, which induces expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and results in the establishment of an antiviral state (Darnell et al., 1994; Schindler and Darnell, 1995; Stark et al., Some PRRSV strains suppress IFN-b expression in MARC-145 cells and PRRSV non-structural proteins (nsp) 1, 2, 4, and 11 inhibit IFN induction when over-expressed (Beura et al., Attenuated live virus vaccines have been commercially available for years; however, outbreaks of PRRS resulting from viral strains nearly identical in sequence to the vaccine strain have been reported (Botner et al., In the present study, we discovered a PRRSV isolate that induced production of type I IFNs in both MARC-145 and PAM cells and appeared to have an undetectable inhibitory effect on the ability of IFN-a to induce an antiviral response. Its infection of PAMs led to an undetectable cytopathic effect. The levels of the proteins were similar to those of cells treated with 1000 U\/ml IFN-a. These results suggested that A2MC2 induced synthesis of type I IFNs in MARC-145 cells. A scrambled control PPMO CP1 was included as a negative control. Genotyping of this isolate was then performed. There were a total of 34 nucleotide variations when compared to strain MLV, resulting in 19 different amino acids. Compared to both VR-2332 and MLV, A2MC2 has 15 unique nucleotides scattered from nt 4681 to the end of the genome (Fig. The sequence from nt 11667 to 14420 of A2MC2 is the same as VR-2332 except 4 unique nucleotide variations. At the amino acid level, the A2MC2 differences when compared to VR-2332 were located in nsp3, nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp11, nsp12, GP3, and M; and the variations from MLV sequence were located in nsp1b, nsp2, nsp8, nsp10, nsp11, nsp12, GP2, GP3, GP5, and M (Supplementary Table 1 ). 2002) , while the functions of nsp8 and nsp12 are unknown. The genomic sequence of A2MC2 when compared to both that of VR-2332 and MLV indicated that A2MC2 was possibly a chimera derived from these two strains. Cell culture supernatant samples were collected daily for five days after the inoculation and titrated for virus yield. The cells inoculated with 0.01 TCID 50 per cell had the highest virus yield, 10 6.67 TCID 50 per ml on day 3, while the cells inoculated with 1 TCID 50 per cell had the lowest yield, lower than 10 3 (Fig. Plaques were observed on 4 dpi after neutral red staining. This result indicated that A2MC2 replication in MARC-145 cells was different from that of MLV. A cell viability assay was conducted to assess the relative viability level between treatments. This result was consistent with the CPE observed under bright field microscopy. The virus yields of A2MC2, MLV, VR-2385, and NVSL were 10 3.8 , 10 3.6 , 10 5.2 , and 10 4.4 TCID 50 per ml, respectively (Fig. To determine if A2MC2 replication induces IFN-stimulated genes in MARC-145 cells, the cells were infected with the virus at 1 TCID 50 per cell and harvested at 24 h post-infection (hpi). The differences of ISG15 and ISG56 between the A2MC2-infected and the IFN-a-treated uninfected cells were statistically insignificant. By 72 hpi, the cells with 1 TCID 50 had the lowest level of these two proteins. Western blot analysis showed that VR-2385, VR-2332, NVSL, and MLV infection had no effect on STAT2 and ISG56 protein level, while A2MC2 infection led to a higher amount of the two proteins (Fig. ELISA was done to detect IFN level in culture supernatants of MARC-145 cells infected with A2MC2, VR-2385, VR-2332, or MLV, respectively. Viral RNAs at these time points were detected by real-time RT-PCR. The data above showed that A2MC2 induced expression of type I IFNs. The inclusion of 16 and 24 hpi was based on the speculation that along with the increase of IFN-b expression, phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 would continue. The IFN bioassay was conducted to assess IFNs in culture supernatant of A2MC2-infected PAMs. The cells were treated with dilutions of the supernatant from A2MC2-infected PAMs and, on the next day, inoculated with NDV-GFP. Many PRRSV strains are known to inhibit the production of type I IFNs in cultured cells and in infected pigs. Vero cells are defective in IFN production and not susceptible to PRRSV. Second, the elevated expression of STAT2 and ISG56 was shown in A2MC2-infected MARC-145 cells. The higher the MOI, the earlier A2MC2 induced ISG elevation. It indicates that the inoculum of 0.01 TCID 50 per cell resulted in limited initial virus replication, leading to a weaker stimulation on cellular PRRs, which allowed the virus to complete its replication cycles. Infection of PAMs with MLV also led to a slight elevation in STAT2 level, which indicates that MLV might induce STAT2 albeit at much lower levels than A2MC2. The result that A2MC2 infection led to increase of IFN-b transcript from 8 hpi to less than 1000-fold at 24 hpi (Fig. The identification of A2MC2 as an IFN-inducer may be beneficial for studying PRRSV interference in IFN signaling, and developing improved vaccines for protective immunity against PRRS. 1993) and Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Avirulent LaSota Newcastle disease virus carrying the gene of green fluorescence protein (NDV-GFP) was propagated in Vero cells, as previously described (Kim and Samal, 2010) . Cell lysate samples were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis as described previously (Zhang et al., Briefly, separated proteins from SDS-PAGE were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with antibodies against STAT2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), b-tubulin (Sigma), phospho-STAT2 (STAT2-Y690) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-STAT1 (STAT1-Y701) (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and ISG56 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Total RNA was isolated from MARC-145 and PAM cells with TRIzol s Reagent (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription and real-time PCR were conducted as previously described (Patel et al., Briefly, CellTiter-Glo reagent was added to cells in a 96-well plate and the luminescence signal was measured with VICTOR3 TM Multilabel Counter (Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Wellesley, MA). Relative percentages of luminescence intensity were calculated by comparison to controls. PRRSV was diluted in a ten-fold series and added to the cells. The virus inoculum was removed 2 h after inoculation and replaced with 0.5% agarose overlay containing complete growth medium. Detection of IFN-a2 in each sample was done by using VeriKine TM Cynomolgus\/Rhesus Interferon-Alpha Serum ELISA kit (PBL InterferonSource, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Sequence assembly and analysis was done with LaserGene Core Suite (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). A twotailed P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant."},{"Unnamed: 0":74,"Unnamed: 0.1":74,"doc_id":"88a6f16e3a29467781615ad847b2b00d78fee8dd","title":"Phagocytic cells contribute to the antibody-mediated elimination of pulmonary-infected SARS coronavirus","abstract":"While the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulted in 774 deaths, patients who were affected with mild pulmonary symptoms successfully recovered. The objective of the present work was to identify, using SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse infection models, immune factors responsible for clearing of the virus. The elimination of pulmonary SARS-CoV infection required the activation of B cells by CD4 \u00fe T cells. Furthermore, passive immunization (post-infection) with homologous (murine) anti-SARS-CoV antiserum showed greater elimination efficacy against SARS-CoV than that with heterologous (rabbit) antiserum, despite the use of equivalent titers of neutralizing antibodies. This distinction was mediated by mouse phagocytic cells (monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages and partially alveolar macrophages, but not neutrophils), as demonstrated both by adoptive transfer from donors and by immunological depletion of selected cell types. These results indicate that the cooperation of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and phagocytic cells plays an important role in the elimination of SARS-CoV.","text_body":"From November 2002 to July 2003, the world suffered a global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The disease, which resulted in 8098 cases with 774 deaths, was caused by a novel type of coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV, (http:\/\/www.who.int\/csr\/sars\/ country\/table2004_04_21\/en\/index.html). Patients with SARS usually developed a high fever followed by clinical symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease. In severe cases, the patients presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, and ultimately died (Peiris et al., 2003a (Peiris et al., , 2003b Fowler et al., 2003; Wang and Chang 2004) . The hallmarks of severe cases of SARS included high viral titer, systemic infection, lymphopenia, and overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines\/chemokines (often referred to as a \"cytokine storm\") (Wong et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2005; Cameron et al., 2007) . However, there has been no subsequent consensus regarding which treatment, if any, benefited SARS patients during the outbreak (Stockman et al., 2007) .\r\n The development of an effective treatment strategy for SARS cases will require clarifying the precise mechanisms by which host immune responses control SARS-CoV infection. Cumulative evidence suggests that patients who recovered from SARS possessed specific acquired immunity based on both T and B cells (Yang et al., 2006 (Yang et al., , 2007 Li et al., 2008; Fan et al., 2009) . However, the effector cells or molecules that act to eliminate SARS-CoV during the acute phase of the infection remain unclear. As the extensive outbreak of SARS has not recurred since 2003, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV infection causes the pathogenesis and host immune responses has been investigated using adequate animal infectious models (Roberts et al., 2005 Nagata et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2009; Zhao and Perlman, 2010) . Lethal disease in BALB\/c mice infected with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV, MA15, showed a lack of activation of innate immune response, resulting in a barely detectable antivirus T cell response (Zhao et al., 2009 On the other hand, aged BALB\/c mice that were infected with a human clinical isolate of SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) successfully eliminated the invasive virus within 1 week post-infection; these mice exhibited high and prolonged levels of viral replication, signs consistent with clinical symptoms, and pathologic changes in the lung resembling those seen in elderly SARS patients (Roberts et al., 2005) . Therefore, the infection of these aged mice is considered a model for the successful elimination of SARS-CoV by host immune responses. A recent study reported that CD4 \u00fe T cells play an important role in the control of SARS-CoV infection (Chen et al., 2010) . These researchers also reported an important role for innate defense mechanisms in controlling SARS-CoV infection, as demonstrated by the clearance of SARS-CoV over 9 days post-infection (dpi) in BALB\/c mice depleted of both CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells (Chen et al., 2010) . These results suggest that both innate and adaptive immune responses are essential for controlling SARS-CoV infection. Nonetheless, the identity and role of effector cells and molecules participating in the elimination of SARS-CoV during the acute phase of SARS remain largely unknown.\r\n In this study, we attempted to identify the types of immune cells that contribute to clearing SARS-CoV during the acute phase of the infection. This work employed several murine models in which hosts were deficient for (e.g., depleted via specific antibodies or lacking via immunodeficiency) or supplemented with (e.g., by adoptive transfer) individual immunologic effectors. We demonstrate that phagocytic cells (including monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages and partially alveolar macrophages) play an important role in the elimination of SARS-CoV in mouse models of infection.\r\n Adaptive immune responses are essential for the elimination of pulmonary-infected SARS-CoV As a first step, we confirmed the time course of viral titers in the lungs of aged (46 months old) BALB\/c mice, young (7 weeks old) BALB\/c mice, and young (8 weeks old) SCID mice following infection with SARS-CoV Vietnam\/NB-04\/2003. The intranasal (i.n.) infection of aged BALB\/c mice with SARS-CoV resulted in over 10 8 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 )\/g lung tissue at 2 dpi (Fig. 1A) . The infected mice exhibited histological signs of severe pneumonia, including interstitial cell thickening, immune cell infiltration, and epithelial damage in the bronchus, at 9 dpi and 21 dpi (Fig. 1B(c and d) ). These results were similar to those of the previous reports that used another SARS-CoV strain such as the Urbani strain (Roberts et al., 2005) . In the present work, SARS-CoV was detected in aged mice starting as early as 2 dpi (Fig. 1A) . The observed titers in the aged-mouse model were considerably higher than those seen in infected young BALB\/c mice, which did not show apparent histological signs of pneumonia (Fig. 2B) . Titers in the aged mice remained high ($ 10 7 TCID 50 \/g lung tissue) at 6 dpi ( Fig. 1A) . However, the titers decreased to levels below the lower limit of detection (LLOD; o1000 TCID 50 \/g lung tissue) in the lungs of aged BALB\/c mice and young BALB\/c mice at 9 dpi (Fig. 1A) . In contrast, young SCID mice, which lack functional T and B cells, were persistently infected with SARS-CoV during the experimental period (through 21 dpi, as shown in Fig. 1A ). At this time, SCID mice did not exhibit histological signs of severe pneumonia at 9 and 21 dpi, although a high viral titer was detected in the lungs of these animals during the experimental period ( Fig. 1B(g and h) and C). Recently, Zhao and Perlman (2010) obtained similar results suggesting that a mouse-adapted mutant of SARS-CoV (viral strain MA15) persistently infected RAG1 knockout mice (C57BL\/6 background), animals that also lack T and B cell populations. Taken together, these results suggested that the pathogenesis of SARS does not correlate with the direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV. To investigate the effect of adaptive immune responses on clearance of pulmonaryinfected SARS-CoV, either na\u00efve splenocytes (obtained from BALB\/c mice) or sensitized splenocytes (obtained from SARS-CoV-infected (9 dpi) BALB\/c mice) were adoptively transplanted into na\u00efve SCID mice 1 day before SARS-CoV infection. As shown in Fig. 1D , the SCID mice that received na\u00efve splenocytes eliminated SARS-CoV from their lungs as early as the BALB\/c mice did. The SCID mice transplanted with SARS-CoV-sensitized splenocytes of BALB\/c mice eliminated SARS-CoV more rapidly than mice transplanted with na\u00efve splenocytes, although the initial pulmonary viral titers were effectively the same in all groups of SCID mice at 2 dpi, with or without the transfer of splenocytes. Only one of the SCID mice that received sensitized splenocytes showed detectable lung pulmonary viral titer (3.5 \u00c2 10 4 TCID 50 \/g lung) at 6 dpi; titers in the remaining 3 animals of this group (n\u00bc4\/time point) were below the LLOD. The SCID mice transplanted with na\u00efve-or sensitized-splenocytes derived from aged BALB\/c mice did not show histological signs of severe pneumonia at 9 dpi, although infiltration of immunocompetent cells around bronchioles (arrows) was partially observed in the lung of both groups (Fig. 1E ). These results indicated that induction of adaptive immune responses is essential for the clearance of pulmonary-infected SARS-CoV.\r\n To identify the host defense(s) involved in the elimination of SARS-CoV in the lung, we depleted CD4 \u00fe cells and\/or CD8 \u00fe cells in BALB\/c mice before and after SARS-CoV infection. Depletion of the CD4 \u00fe cells or CD8 \u00fe cells was performed by intravenous (i.v.) injection of (respectively) monoclonal antibody (mAb) GK1.5 or 53.6; control experiments demonstrated that injection of these mAbs produced virtually complete depletion of the corresponding cell populations (Fig. 1F ). The CD4 \u00fe T cell-depleted BALB\/c mice and the CD4 \u00fe T and CD8 \u00fe T cell-double-depleted BALB\/c mice failed to eliminate the SARS-CoV-infected pulmonary cells by 9 dpi (Fig. 1G ). In contrast, the CD8 \u00fe T cell-depleted BALB\/c mice largely eliminated the SARS-CoV-infected pulmonary cells by 9 dpi (Fig. 1G) . Recently, Chen et al. (2010) reported that both CD4 \u00fe T cells and neutralizing antibodies (following antibody response) play an important role in the elimination of SARS-CoVinfected pulmonary cells. However, it remains unclear whether the elimination of the virus in the present work and by Chen et al. (2010) reflects direct antiviral effect(s) by CD4 \u00fe T cells and\/or B cells. Notably, several reports have demonstrated the presence of CD4 \u00fe T cells with cytotoxic activity during persistent viral infection, including infection by human immunodeficiency virus, human cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus (Appay et al., 2002; Casazza et al., 2006; Landais et al., 2004) . Furthermore, CD4 \u00fe T cell-mediated control of a \u03b3-herpes virus in B celldeficient mice is mediated by interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) (Christensen et al., 1999) . In the present work, we found that SARS-CoV persistently infected the lung of nude (T cell-deficient) mice, as well as SCID mice (deficient of T cell and B cell), without inducing histological signs of pneumonia ( Fig. 2A and B ). Therefore, we investigated (using either of two models) whether CD4 \u00fe T cells could directly eliminate SARS-CoV via IFN-\u03b3 secretion. Our first model consisted of the adoptive transfer, 1 day before SARS-CoV infection, of CD4 \u00fe cells (1 \u00c2 10 7 cells\/mouse) from BALB\/c mice into nude mice and SCID mice. The SCID mice that received the CD4 \u00fe T cell transfer did not eradicate SARS-CoV infection by 9 dpi (Fig. 2C ). In contrast, nude mice that received the same quantity of CD4 \u00fe cells decreased the pulmonary viral titer below the LLOD between 6 and 9 dpi (Fig. 2D) . For our second model, we investigated the effect of IFN-\u03b3 on the elimination of SARS-CoV by using IFN-\u03b3-deficient mouse models. The IFN-\u03b3-deficient mice and the SCID mice that received splenocytes from IFN-\u03b3 deficient mice controlled the SARS-CoV infection as well as the wild-type mice did (Fig. 2E) . These results demonstrated that CD4 \u00fe T cells are an essential cell type for the control of SARS-CoV infection, and that the effect of this cell fraction is indirect.\r\n The above results showed that SARS-CoV infection could be controlled both by nude mice which received CD4 \u00fe cells and by CD8 \u00fe cell-depleted BALB\/c mice, suggesting that B cell is implicated in the elimination of SARS-CoV. So far, there are multiple studies that demonstrated the prophylactic effect of neutralizing antibodies against (hematoxylin and eosin staining; section thickness 4 \u03bcm) from aged BALB\/c mice at 9 dpi (a and c) and 21 dpi (b and d) and from young SCID mice at 9 dpi (e and g) and\r\n 21 dpi (f and h).

The limit of detection was o 1 \u00c2 10 3 TCID 50 \/g lung. Data are presented as mean 7 S.D. (n \u00bc3-7\/time point).\r\n SARS-CoV in animal models. (Casazza et al., 2006; Landais et al., 2004; Christensen et al., 1999; Nicholls et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2004) . Furthermore, we examined whether B cells play an important role in the elimination of SARS-CoV in the lung by using SCID mice that were transplanted with B cells of na\u00efve BALB\/c mice before infection with the virus. Although the CD19 \u00fe cell-transplanted SCID mice (CD19 \u00fe cells; purity 98.3%) did not decrease the pulmonary SARS-CoV titer by 9 dpi, the SCID mice that had received a combination of both cell fractions (the CD19 \u00fe cell subset and the residual cell subsets (CD19 \u00c0 subsets containing T cells)) exhibited marked decreases in pulmonary SARS-CoV titer (to less than 1 \u00c2 10 4 TCID 50 \/g lung tissue; Fig. 3A ). SCID mice that received the residual cell subsets alone (i.e., a CD19 \u00c0 fraction) also did not exhibit decreased pulmonary SARS-CoV titer by 9 dpi (Fig. 3A) .\r\n To examine whether post-infection treatment with anti-SARS-CoV Abs could control SARS-CoV infection, SCID mice were infected i. n. with SARS-CoV and then were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice with 0.5 mL of rabbit anti-spike (S) protein antiserum (neutralization titer [NT 50 ]4300 against SARS-CoV; raised against SARS-CoV S protein expressed via recombinant vaccinia virus (Kitabatake et al., 2007; Yasui et al., 2008) ). The group treated with anti-S protein antiserum eliminated SARS-CoV infection, but neither control group (treated with normal rabbit serum or rabbit antiserum raised against non-recombinant vaccinia virus) eliminated SARS-CoV infection ( Fig. 3B ). The decrease of pulmonary-infected SARS-CoV titer in the anti-S protein antiserum-treated SCID mice was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR for the detection of mRNA of the nucleocapsid (N) protein-encoding gene of SARS-CoV (Fig. 3C ). These results suggested that the production of anti-SARS-CoV Abs by B cells, which is a T cell-dependent process, plays an important role in the control of SARS-CoV infection.\r\n Multiple studies have demonstrated that neutralizing Abs are important humoral factors for the control of viral infection. As shown in Fig. 3B , administration of high-dose neutralizing Abs (NT 50 4300; 0.5 mL \u00c2 2 doses) eliminated SARS-CoV, although the antisera used were derived from other animal species. However, when BALB\/c mice eradicated the SARS-CoV infection (9 dpi), the neutralization titer of antiserum from these BALB\/c mice achieved an NT 50 of 40-80 (Yasui et al., 2008) . To investigate whether the neutralizing activity of Abs is crucial for controlling SARS-CoV infection, the SARS-CoV-infected SCID mice were administered i.p. at 6 dpi with lower doses of either mouse anti-SARS-CoV antiserum or rabbit anti-S protein antiserum. For this experiment, the neutralization titers of both mouse anti-SARS-CoV antiserum and rabbit BALB\/c mice at 9 dpi (a) and 20 dpi (b) and young nude mice at 9 dpi (c) and 20 dpi (d). For all micrographs, original magnification is 200 \u00c2 . (C) Virus titer in the lung of CD4 \u00fe cell-transplanted SCID mice was determined at 6 and 9 dpi. Data are presented as mean 7S.D. (n\u00bc 5\/time point). CD4 \u00fe cells (1 \u00c2 10 7 cells) were administered to each recipient SCID mouse intravenously 1 day before challenge. (D) Virus titer in the lung of nude mice adoptively transplanted with CD4 \u00fe cells (gray) or residual cells (CD4 \u00c0 cells; black), determined at 6 and 9 dpi. Untreated nude mice (white) were included as a control. CD4 \u00fe cells (1 \u00c2 10 7 cells) or residual cells (3 \u00c2 10 7 cells) were administered to each recipient nude mouse intravenously 1 day before challenge. Data are presented as mean 7 S.D. (n \u00bc3\/time point). (E) Pulmonary virus titer of IFN-\u03b3 deficient mice and splenocyte-transplanted SCID mice at 6 and 9 dpi. Splenocytes (4 \u00c2 10 7 cells) derived from IFN-\u03b3 deficient mice were administered to each recipient SCID mouse intravenously 1 day before challenge. Data are presented as mean 7 S.D. (n\u00bc 3\/time point). N.D.: not detected. SPL, splenocyte. anti-S protein antiserum were adjusted to NT 50 \u00bc40; mouse anti-SARS-CoV antiserum also was tested at NT 50 \u00bc 13.3. As shown in Fig. 3D , the single injection (0.2 mL i.v., NT 50 \u00bc40) of mouse SARS-CoV antiserum, but not that of rabbit anti-S protein antiserum, reduced the pulmonary SARS-CoV titer. The single injection of mouse anti-SARS-CoV antiserum at an even lower neutralization titer (0.2 mL, NT 50 \u00bc 13.3) also reduced the pulmonary virus titer by greater than 100-fold compared with that of untreated animals. Importantly, the SCID mice treated with rabbit anti-S protein antiserum did not eliminate SARS-CoV by 9 dpi, although the antisera of SCID mice treated with the rabbit antiserum clearly demonstrated neutralization activity against SARS-CoV (Fig. 3E) . The inconsistency between the in vitro (neutralizing activity) and in vivo (clearance of pulmonary SARS-CoV) activities of the rabbit antiserum suggested that other effectors, besides anti-SARS-CoV Abs, also might be required to control SARS-CoV infection.\r\n To identify the effectors involved in the elimination of SARS-CoV-infected pulmonary cells in our mouse models, we tested the contribution of several candidate effectors. SARS-CoV-infected BALB\/c mice were depleted of the first candidate, complement, by the injection of cobra venom factor (CVF; 40 U\/mouse) at 5 and 6 dpi. Despite the depletion of C3 from the serum of BALB\/c mice following CVF injection (Fig. 4A) , CVF-treated BALB\/c mice still eliminated SARS-CoV by 9 dpi (Fig. 4B) . These results demonstrated that the complement-antibody complex is not required for the control of SARS-CoV infection in this model. We next investigated the contribution of NK cells to the elimination of SARS-CoV by administering anti-IL-2R\u03b2 mAb (TM-\u03b21), a treatment known to result in long-term depletion of NK cells (Tanaka et al., 1993) . We injected i.p. TM-\u03b21 (100 mL of ascites) into both SCID and BALB\/c mice. Three days after TM-\u03b21 treatment, NK cell-depleted BALB\/c mice splenocytes were transferred adoptively into NK cell-depleted SCID mice. The SCID mice were infected i.n. with SARS-CoV at 1 day after the splenocyte transfer. As shown in Fig. 4C , NK cells were considerably depleted in both the donor BALB\/c mice (spleen) and the recipient SCID mice. However, virus still was eradicated in this NK-depleted model (Fig. 4D) ; thus, Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which requires NK cells, was excluded as a mechanism for the elimination of SARS-CoV.\r\n Other blood cells also may serve as effectors for the control of SARS-CoV. Specifically, elevated levels of alveolar macrophages, monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages, and neutrophils were observed in many SARS patients (Nicholls et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003) . While these three cell types have been implicated in SARS pathology, the role of these cell subsets in the control of SARS-CoV infection is still unknown. To investigate the role of these myeloid cells in the clearance of SARS-CoV-infected pulmonary tissue, each subset of these myeloid cells was depleted by administration of a specific mAb or reagent. Consistent with previous reports (Pribul et al., 2008) , alveolar macrophages were depleted for more than 5 days following i.n. administration of 100 \u03bcL of 30% clodronate liposome (Fig. 5A ). (Note that we used 30% clodronate liposome, thereby avoiding the intensive infiltration of neutrophils seen with administration of 100% clodronate liposome (Fig. 5A) ). Neutrophils (CD11b \u00fe and Ly-6G hi ) and Gr-1 int monocytes in blood and lung were significantly depleted for at least 3 days after i.p. treatment with 250 \u03bcg of anti-Gr-1 mAb, whereas neutrophils alone were depleted upon administration of anti-Ly-6G mAb (1A8) (Fig. 5B and Daley et al., 2008) . The Gr-1 \u00fe cell-and\/or alveolar macrophage-depleted groups failed to eliminate the pulmonary SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 5C) , whereas the alveolar macrophage-depleted group showed partial elimination of the virus. In contrast, the neutrophil-depleted BALB\/c animals (anti-Ly-6G mAb-treated mice) eliminated SARS-CoV by 9 dpi (Fig. 5C ). Importantly, the neutralizing Ab titer of these cell-depleted mice was comparable to that of untreated BALB\/c mice (Fig. 5D, p \u00bc0.37) . Similar results were obtained in murine anti-SARS-CoV antiseratreated SCID mice that were administered with clodronate liposome and\/or anti-Gr-1 mAb (Fig. 5E) . These results suggest that phagocytic cells, especially monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages, cooperate with anti-SARS-CoV Abs to provide control of SARS-CoV infection in these mouse models.\r\n The outbreak of SARS in 2002-2003 resulted in over 8000 cases, with 10% mortality. The worst symptoms might correlate with age-dependent defects of immune response, given that mortality exceeded 50% in patients over 65 years of age (Peiris et al., 2004) . A recent study using MA15-infected mouse models suggested that age-dependent increases of prostaglandin D2 expression in the lung may be associated with impaired immune response (Zhao et al., 2011) . Retrospective analyses of recovered SARS patients suggests that patients who recovered from SARS possessed specific acquired immunity based on both T and B cells (Yang et al., 2006 (Yang et al., , 2007 Li et al., 2008; Fan et al., 2009) . Notably, most patients who recover from SARS had elevated and sustained levels of neutralizing Abs, and patients with longer illnesses exhibited lower levels of neutralizing Abs than did patients with shorter durations of illness (Temperton et al., 2005; Ho et al., 2005) . Previous studies revealed that passive transfer of immune serum to na\u00efve animals prevented SARS-CoV replication in the lower respiratory tract (Yang et al., 2004; Subbarao et al., 2004; Kam et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2007; Rockx et al., 2008 Rockx et al., , 2011 . Taken together, these results suggest that Ab responses likely play an important role in determining the ultimate disease outcome of SARS-CoV infection. Virus could be eradicated by direct binding of the virus by the neutralizing Abs and\/or by cooperation between virus-specific Abs and other effector cells, including complement, NK cells, and phagocytic cells. However, the actual mechanism that controls the acute phase of SARS-CoV infection remained unclear.\r\n In this study, we found that rabbit antiserum raised against the S protein of SARS-CoV exhibited significantly lower efficacy in the control of the virus infection than mouse anti-SARS-CoV antiserum when similar neutralization titers against SARS-CoV were transferred into recipient mice. Therefore, it appears that the neutralization activity of Ab against SARS-CoV does not correlate with the clearance efficacy of the virus from infected murine lung. On the other hand, some other antibody property (such as avidity) may differ between the murine and rabbit antisera, given that the former is a polyclonal species derived from SARS-CoV-infected mice, while the latter was generated in rabbit against the S protein. Further study will be needed to resolve this distinction. In a Chinese hamster model of SARS, post-infection treatment (at 1 dpi) with 100 mg\/kg of equine neutralizing F(ab') 2 resulted in only partial reduction of pulmonary viral titer, although prophylactic treatment at a 10-fold lower dose was sufficient to completely block SARS-CoV infection (Luo et al., 2007) . This result suggests that the anti-infective activity of a neutralizing Ab is mediated primarily via prevention of SARS-CoV invasion; the neutralizing Ab plays a lesser role in eliminating the virus after establishment of infection.\r\n Therefore, we focused on the cooperation between anti-SARS-CoV Abs and other effectors in the control of SARS-CoV infection. Candidate effectors include complement (e.g., C3 and other members of the complement-antibody complex pathway), NK cells (mediators of the Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway), and Fc gamma receptor (Fc\u03b3R)-bearing cells (notably alveolar macrophages, monocytes [monocytes-derived infiltrating macrophages], and neutrophils). A previous study reported that anti-Gr-1 mAb (RB6-8C5) recognizes not only neutrophils but also additional leukocyte populations, including monocytes (Daley et al., 2008) . Therefore, we used both anti-Gr-1 mAb and neutrophil-specific mAb (anti-Ly-6G mAb) to discriminate monocytes and neutrophils. We tested the role of these candidates by selective depletion of a mouse infection model for various factors using CVF (complement depletion), anti-IL-2R\u03b2 mAb (TM-\u03b21; NK cell depletion), clodronate liposomes (alveolar macrophage depletion), anti-Gr-1 mAb (monocytes\/neutrophil depletion), or anti-Ly6G mAb (neutrophil depletion) before or after SARS-CoV infection. Notably, the groups administered with clodronate liposome or anti-Gr-1 mAb, but not those treated with anti-Ly-6G mAb, failed to eliminate SARS-CoV from their lungs by 9 dpi. Our results indicated that phagocytic cells such as monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages and partially alveolar macrophages, but not neutrophils, play a crucial role in the elimination of SARS-CoVinfected pulmonary cells in mice. Although little is known about (B) Depletion of neutrophils and monocytes with anti-Gr-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or anti-Ly-6G mAb (respectively). The panel shows results of flow cytometric analysis of CD11b and Gr-1 expression of leukocytes in blood and lung of BALB\/c mice at 3 days after the administration of anti-Gr-1 mAb or anti-Ly-6G mAb. Untreated BALB\/c was used as a control. Representative diagrams are shown. (C) Pulmonary virus titers of BALB\/c mice that were administered anti-Ly-6G mAb (depletion of neutrophils), clodronate liposome (depletion of alveolar macrophages; gray), anti-Gr-1 mAb (depletion of Gr-1 \u00fe cells; dark gray), or both clodronate liposome and anti-Gr-1 mAb (black) were determined 9 dpi.

(E) Pulmonary virus titers of passively immunized SCID mice (i.e., injected with anti-SARS-CoV antiserum) that were administered clodronate liposome (CL; depletion of alveolar macrophages; gray), anti-Gr-1 mAb (depletion of Gr-1 \u00fe cells; dark gray), or both CL and anti-Gr-1 mAb (black) were determined at 9 dpi. Data are presented as mean 7 S.D. (n\u00bc 3-6\/group). N.D.: not detected. host defense mechanisms in the acute phase of SARS clinical infection, infiltration of large numbers of macrophages into the lungs of SARS patients was observed (Nicholls et al., 2003; Franks et al., 2003) . Those reports are consistent with our results, although further studies are necessary to clarify the mechanism (s) of elimination of SARS-CoV via cooperation of phagocytic cells and SARS-CoV-specific antibodies.\r\n While a previous study (Chen et al., 2010) and our results (Fig. 1G) showed that depletion of CD8 \u00fe T cell at the time of infection had little effect on viral replication or clearance, Zhao and Perlman (2010) reported that adaptive transfer of CD8 \u00fe T cells sensitized with the SARS-CoV MA 15 strain into na\u00efve BALB\/c mice completely protected the recipients from a subsequent challenge with lethal dose of MA15. Zhao et al. also showed that the diminished virus-specific CD8 \u00fe T cell responses resulted from inefficient activation of alveolar macrophages and respiratory dendritic cells in lethal diseases (Zhao et al., 2009 (Zhao et al., , 2012 Zhao and Perlman, 2010) . Their studies also demonstrated suboptimal responses of CD4 \u00fe T cell responses as well as CD8 \u00fe T cells, implying a critical role for antibody responsiveness in the MA15 infection model. In addition, while depletion of alveolar macrophages before MA15 infection completely protected mice from this lethal challenge, the depletion of alveolar macrophages at 2 days after MA15 infection appeared to exacerbate mortality (Zhao et al., 2009) . Therefore, our findings would be rendered more persuasive by the inclusion of additional animal infection experiments using other patient isolates, such as the Urbani strain, and mouseadapted strains, such as MA15, of SARS-CoV.\r\n Although the importance of other effector cells for clearance of coronaviruses is still unknown, there are several reports that showed the implication of Fc\u03b3R-bearing cells in the clearance of influenza virus. Fujisawa (2008) noted that neutrophils play a crucial role in the control of influenza virus infection by cooperation with anti-influenza virus antibodies. It also has been reported that FcR\u03b3 \u00c0 \/ \u00c0 mice were highly susceptible to influenza virus infection, even in the presence of anti-influenza Abs from immune FcR\u03b3 \u00fe \/ \u00fe mice (Huber et al., 2001) . These results indicate the important role of Fc\u03b3R-bearing effector cells in the clearance of influenza virus infections. In addition, we here demonstrated that both monocyte-derived macrophages (infiltrating-type) and partially alveolar macrophages (resident-type) contribute to the elimination of SARS-CoV-infected pulmonary cells in the presence of anti-SARS-CoV Abs.\r\n Alveolar macrophages play a central role in maintaining lung homeostasis and are considered the first line of host defense against respiratory microbes. Marked enhancement of the virus titer was reported in other respiratory virus infection models (Pribul et al., 2008; Tumpey et al., 2005) . On the other hand, monocytes circulate throughout the body in anticipation of inflammation and infection. Murine monocytes are reported to comprise two distinct subpopulations with different phenotypes: CX3CR1 lo CCR2 \u00fe Gr-1 \u00fe and CX3CR1 hi CCR2 -Gr-1 \u00c0 monocytes (Geissmann et al., 2003) . On infiltration of the infection site, Gr-1 \u00fe inflammatory monocytes can give rise to various dendritic cells and macrophage types (Varol et al., 2009) . Iijima et al. (2011) demonstrated that Gr-1 \u00fe monocyte-derived APCs are required to elicit IFN-\u03b3 secretion from effector Th1 cells, thus mediating host protection against HSV-2 infection. Lin et al. (2008) reported that monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages cause immune pathology rather than viral clearance during influenza virus infection. In contrast, Gr-1 \u00fe monocyte-derived cells are involved in the clearance of SARS-CoV infection, although the role of Gr-1 \u00fe monocytederived cells in the development of pathogenesis during SARS-CoV infection remains unknown.\r\n In conclusion, we demonstrate a crucial role for cooperation of antigen-specific antibodies and phagocytic cells (monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages and partially alveolar macrophages) in the elimination of SARS-CoV in mouse models of infection. Our findings provide a better understanding of the mechanism(s) by which host defenses control SARS-CoV infection. Ideally, this information can contribute to the development of novel therapeutic protocols or treatments for SARS.\r\n These studies used the SARS-CoV Vietnam\/NB-04\/2003 strain. This strain, originally isolated from a single patient's throat lavage, was kindly provided by Dr. Mai Quynh Le (Hong et al., 2004) and further subcultured in Vero E6 cells grown in MEM (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) containing 5% FCS. All work using SARS-CoV was performed in Biosafety Level 3 facilities by personnel wearing powered air-purifying respirators (Shigematsu Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).\r\n SCID mice (female, 7-8 weeks old) were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). BALB\/c mice (female, 46 months old and 6-7 weeks old) and nude mice (female, 6 weeks old) were purchased from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). The IFN-\u03b3 deficient mouse (BALB\/c background) was the kind gift of Prof. Iwakura (The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo and Tokyo University of Science). On study day 0, mice were inoculated i.n.\r\n with SARS-CoV at 1 \u00c2 10 5 TCID 50 (20 \u03bcL) per mouse. At serial time points, mice were sacrificed under anesthesia following terminal blood collection, and the lungs were recovered. Portions of the tissues were frozen immediately at \u00c0 80 1C or fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Blood was used for the in vitro neutralization assays and adoptive transfer experiments. All animal experiments using mice were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee at The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, and were performed in accordance with the animal experimentation guidelines of The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo.\r\n To confirm the depletion efficacy of anti-CD4 mAb (GK1.5; 100 mL of ascites) or anti-CD8 mAb (53.6; 100 mL of ascites), BALB\/c mice were injected i.v. with the indicated dose volumes. At 1 day after administration of the respective mAb, spleen-derived lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry for expression of CD4 and CD8. To test efficacy against SARS-CoV infection, the anti-CD4 mAb and\/or anti-CD8 mAb was injected i.v. on days \u00c0 3, 0, \u00fe 3 and \u00fe6 with respect to the SARS-CoV challenge. For experiments examining the depletion of Gr-1 \u00fe (Ly-6G \u00fe and Ly-6C \u00fe ) cells, anti-Gr-1 mAb (250 mg, RB6-8C5; rat IgG2b) was injected i.p. 6 days after SARS-CoV challenge (Fujisawa, 2008) . The hybridoma RB6-8C5 was obtained from the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging, and Cancer, Tohoku University (Miyagi, Japan). Anti-IL2R\u03b2 mAb (TM-\u03b21), used for the depletion of NK cells (Tanaka et al., 1993) , was the kind gift of Prof. Miyasaka (Osaka University, Japan). TM-\u03b21 (100 mL of ascites) was injected i.p. 3 days before adoptive transfer of BALB\/ c mice splenocytes into both SCID and BALB\/c mice. Anti-Ly6G mAb (1 mg, 1A8; rat IgG2a [purchased from Bio-XCell Co., Ltd.]) was injected i.p. 6 days after SARS-CoV challenge to deplete Ly-6G \u00fe cells (neutrophils) (Daley et al., 2008) . The depletion of the respective immunocompetent cells was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. One hundred microliters of 30% clodronate liposome suspension was injected i.n. in mice 6 days after SARS-CoV challenge to deplete alveolar macrophages (Pribul et al., 2008) . The numbers of AMs were quantified in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). To deplete complement, cobra venom factor (CVF; 40 U\/mouse, a gift of Prof.Okada, Nagoya City University, Japan) was injected i.p. in SCID mice both 5 and 6 days after SARS-CoV challenge (Pleyer et al., 1992) .\r\n Splenocytes were isolated from SARS-CoV-infected (9 dpi; sensitized) or na\u00efve BALB\/c mice (over 6 months old); the resulting cells then were administered (at 4 \u00c2 10 7 cells\/animal) to recipient na\u00efve SCID mouse i.v. 1 day before challenge. Splenocytes from NK cell-depleted BALB\/c mice also were administered to recipient NK cell-depleted SCID mice as described above. CD4 \u00fe cells (1 \u00c2 10 7 cells) were isolated from the spleen of na\u00efve BALB\/c mice using anti-CD4 magnetic beads, followed by purification with an AutoMACS sorter (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Isolated CD4 \u00fe cells ( 496% purity) were adoptively transplanted into each recipient na\u00efve SCID or nude mouse. In addition, splenocytes of na\u00efve BALB\/c mice were divided into the CD19 \u00fe cells (B cells) and residual cells (CD19 \u00c0 cells, including T cells) using anti-CD19 magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech). The B cells (CD19 \u00fe cells; 2 \u00c2 10 7 cells\/mouse) and\/or the residual cells (CD19 \u00c0 cells; 2 \u00c2 10 7 cells\/mouse) then were adoptively transplanted into the recipient na\u00efve SCID mice.\r\n In our previous study, New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with a recombinant vaccinia virus LC16m8 strain expressing the gene for the S protein of SARS-CoV (Kitabatake et al., 2007) . The resulting antisera (rabbit anti-S protein) showed high neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV (NT 50 4300). As negative controls for this rabbit anti-S antiserum, we used normal rabbit serum and\/or rabbit antiserum against vaccinia virus strain LC16m8. Mouse anti-SARS-CoV antiserum was obtained from BALB\/c mice at 9 days after SARS-CoV infection, at which point the antiserum exhibited NT 50 \u00bc $40. For passive transfer, each recipient na\u00efve mouse received 0.2-0.5 mL of rabbit anti-S protein antiserum or mouse anti-SARS-CoV antiserum, administered i.v. at 6 dpi (or at 6 and 8 dpi).\r\n The SARS-CoV titers in the murine lung were determined as described previously (Yasui et al., 2008) . Briefly, lung tissue samples were homogenized in 10 volumes of Leibovitz 15 medium (Invitrogen, CA, USA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 400 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 1C. The supernatant was collected and stored at \u00c080 1C until use. Serial 10-fold dilutions of the supernatant were added to Vero E6 cells seeded on 96-well plates. After 6 days of incubation, the cells were fixed with 10% buffered formalin. Viral titers were determined as the 50% endpoint dilution of the homogenate that induced the cytopathic effect, and were expressed as TCID 50 per gram of tissue. The method used for endpoint calculation was that described by Reed and Muench (1938) .\r\n Serial 2-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated sera (41:4) were mixed with equal volumes of 200 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV and incubated at 37 1C for 1 h. Vero E6 cells then were infected with 100 mL of the virus-serum mixtures in 96-well plates. After 6 days of incubation, the neutralization titer was determined as the endpoint dilution of the serum at which there was 50% inhibition of the SARS-CoV-induced cytopathic effect. The method used for endpoint calculation was that described by Reed and Muench (1938) .\r\n In accordance with a previous report, 10% formalin-fixed lung tissues of the SARS-CoV-infected mice were embedded in paraffin (Yasui et al., 2008) . Paraffin block sections (4-\u03bcm thickness) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Antigen retrieval was performed by autoclaving sections in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 20 min, and then the sections were immersed in 3% hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) at room temperature (RT) for 5 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase. The sections were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 at RT for 30 min, and then were incubated (overnight at 4 1C) with 1 mg\/mL of anti-N protein of SARS-CoV polyclonal antibody (pAb) (IMG548; IMGENEX, San Diego, CA, USA). Secondary labeling was performed by incubation (at RT for 2 h) with 1:1000 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), followed by color development with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) for 30 min. Nuclear staining was performed with hematoxylin solution. Slides were imaged using an Axio Imager A2 microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Oberkochen, Germany).\r\n Total RNA samples were extracted from lung using the illustra RNAspin Midi isolation kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Messenger RNA levels for the N protein-encoding gene of SARS-CoV were measured using the TaqMan EZ RT-PCT kit (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ, USA). Each 25 mL reaction mixture contained 5.0 mL 5 \u00c2 TaqMan EZ buffer, 3.0 mL 25 mM Mn(OAc) 2 , 0.25 mL 1 U\/mL AmpErase UNG (uracil N-glycosylase), 1.0 mL 2.5 U\/mL of rTth DNA polymerase, 3.0 mL dNTP mix (10 mM dATP, 10 mM dCTP, 10 mM dGTP, and 20 mM dUTP), 0.25 mL 10 mM probe, 0.25 mL each 50 mM forward and reverse primers, 7.0 mL nuclease-free water, and 5.0 mL nucleic acid extract. Amplification was carried out in 96-well plates on the ABI Prism 7700 and Sequence Detection System software ver. 1.7. Thermocycling conditions consisted of 2 min at 50 1C for UNG treatment, 30 min at 60 1C for reverse transcription, 5 min at 95 1C for deactivation of UNG, and 50 cycles of 15 s at 95 1C and 1 min at 60 1C for amplification. Each run included pEFMyc-His-SARS-N plasmid (at 10 1 , 10 2 , 10 3 , 10 4 , 10 6 , and 10 8 copies\/5 mL) to provide a standard curve and at least one no-template control. The primers and probe used in this study were as follows: forward primer, 5'-GGAGCCTTGAATACACCCAAAG-3'; reverse primer, 5'-GCACGG-TGGCAGCATTG-3'; probe, 5'-(FAM)-CCACATTGGCACCCGCAATCC-(TAMRA)-3'.\r\n The depletion of complement was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for mouse complement C3 (Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle, WA, USA).\r\n Data are presented as mean 7standard deviation (SD), where applicable. Inferential statistical analysis was performed by One-Way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test. Non-parametric analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Mann-Whitney's U test. A p value o0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical calculations were performed with SPSS Statistics 17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).","sha":"88a6f16e3a29467781615ad847b2b00d78fee8dd","publish_time":"2014-04-30","authors":"Yasui, Fumihiko; Kohara, Michinori; Kitabatake, Masahiro; Nishiwaki, Tetsu; Fujii, Hideki; Tateno, Chise; Yoneda, Misako; Morita, Kouichi; Matsushima, Kouji; Koyasu, Shigeo; Kai, Chieko","journal":"Virology","doi":"10.1016\/j.virol.2014.02.005","Title":"Virology","H index":162.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"From November 2002 to July 2003, the world suffered a global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The disease, which resulted in 8098 cases with 774 deaths, was caused by a novel type of coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV, (http:\/\/www.who.int\/csr\/sars\/ country\/table2004_04_21\/en\/index.html). However, the effector cells or molecules that act to eliminate SARS-CoV during the acute phase of the infection remain unclear. As the extensive outbreak of SARS has not recurred since 2003, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV infection causes the pathogenesis and host immune responses has been investigated using adequate animal infectious models (Roberts et al., 2009 On the other hand, aged BALB\/c mice that were infected with a human clinical isolate of SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) successfully eliminated the invasive virus within 1 week post-infection; these mice exhibited high and prolonged levels of viral replication, signs consistent with clinical symptoms, and pathologic changes in the lung resembling those seen in elderly SARS patients (Roberts et al., These researchers also reported an important role for innate defense mechanisms in controlling SARS-CoV infection, as demonstrated by the clearance of SARS-CoV over 9 days post-infection (dpi) in BALB\/c mice depleted of both CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells (Chen et al., 1D , the SCID mice that received na\u00efve splenocytes eliminated SARS-CoV from their lungs as early as the BALB\/c mice did. In contrast, the CD8 \u00fe T cell-depleted BALB\/c mice largely eliminated the SARS-CoV-infected pulmonary cells by 9 dpi (Fig. 2010) reported that both CD4 \u00fe T cells and neutralizing antibodies (following antibody response) play an important role in the elimination of SARS-CoVinfected pulmonary cells. However, it remains unclear whether the elimination of the virus in the present work and by Chen et al. ( In the present work, we found that SARS-CoV persistently infected the lung of nude (T cell-deficient) mice, as well as SCID mice (deficient of T cell and B cell), without inducing histological signs of pneumonia ( Fig. Our first model consisted of the adoptive transfer, 1 day before SARS-CoV infection, of CD4 \u00fe cells (1 \u00c2 10 7 cells\/mouse) from BALB\/c mice into nude mice and SCID mice. The above results showed that SARS-CoV infection could be controlled both by nude mice which received CD4 \u00fe cells and by CD8 \u00fe cell-depleted BALB\/c mice, suggesting that B cell is implicated in the elimination of SARS-CoV. So far, there are multiple studies that demonstrated the prophylactic effect of neutralizing antibodies against (hematoxylin and eosin staining; section thickness 4 \u03bcm) from aged BALB\/c mice at 9 dpi (a and c) and 21 dpi (b and d) and from young SCID mice at 9 dpi (e and g) and\r\n 21 dpi (f and h). For all micrographs, original magnification is 200 \u00c2 . ( The limit of detection was o 1 \u00c2 10 3 TCID 50 \/g lung. Furthermore, we examined whether B cells play an important role in the elimination of SARS-CoV in the lung by using SCID mice that were transplanted with B cells of na\u00efve BALB\/c mice before infection with the virus. Although the CD19 \u00fe cell-transplanted SCID mice (CD19 \u00fe cells; purity 98.3%) did not decrease the pulmonary SARS-CoV titer by 9 dpi, the SCID mice that had received a combination of both cell fractions (the CD19 \u00fe cell subset and the residual cell subsets (CD19 \u00c0 subsets containing T cells)) exhibited marked decreases in pulmonary SARS-CoV titer (to less than 1 \u00c2 10 4 TCID 50 \/g lung tissue; Fig. C) Virus titer in the lung of CD4 \u00fe cell-transplanted SCID mice was determined at 6 and 9 dpi. CD4 \u00fe cells (1 \u00c2 10 7 cells) were administered to each recipient SCID mouse intravenously 1 day before challenge. ( Untreated nude mice (white) were included as a control. Data are presented as mean 7 S.D. (n\u00bc 3\/time point). We next investigated the contribution of NK cells to the elimination of SARS-CoV by administering anti-IL-2R\u03b2 mAb (TM-\u03b21), a treatment known to result in long-term depletion of NK cells (Tanaka et al., TM-\u03b21 (100 mL of ascites) into both SCID and BALB\/c mice. Consistent with previous reports (Pribul et al., administration of 100 \u03bcL of 30% clodronate liposome (Fig. 5C) , whereas the alveolar macrophage-depleted group showed partial elimination of the virus. These results suggest that phagocytic cells, especially monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages, cooperate with anti-SARS-CoV Abs to provide control of SARS-CoV infection in these mouse models. The outbreak of SARS in 2002-2003 resulted in over 8000 cases, with 10% mortality. Retrospective analyses of recovered SARS patients suggests that patients who recovered from SARS possessed specific acquired immunity based on both T and B cells (Yang et al., In this study, we found that rabbit antiserum raised against the S protein of SARS-CoV exhibited significantly lower efficacy in the control of the virus infection than mouse anti-SARS-CoV antiserum when similar neutralization titers against SARS-CoV were transferred into recipient mice. Further study will be needed to resolve this distinction. C) Pulmonary virus titers of BALB\/c mice that were administered anti-Ly-6G mAb (depletion of neutrophils), clodronate liposome (depletion of alveolar macrophages; gray), anti-Gr-1 mAb (depletion of Gr-1 \u00fe cells; dark gray), or both clodronate liposome and anti-Gr-1 mAb (black) were determined 9 dpi. Our findings provide a better understanding of the mechanism(s) by which host defenses control SARS-CoV infection. These studies used the SARS-CoV Vietnam\/NB-04\/2003 strain.

Although the initial SARS epidemic was contained, sporadic outbreaks of the disease still occur, suggesting a continuous need for a vaccine against this virus.

S-containing exosomes were obtained by replacing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the S protein by those of VSV-G. The immunogenicity and efficacy of the S-containing exosomes were tested in mice and compared to an adenoviral vector vaccine expressing the S protein. Both, S-containing exosomes and the adenoviral vector vaccine induced neutralizing antibody titers.

The disease is characterized by an atypical severe pulmonary disease with high lethality rate (Chan-Yeung, 2004; Chan-Yeung and Yu, 2003; Ho et al., 2003) . Within few months after the first outbreak reported in the Guangdong province of China, the SARS-CoV rapidly spread out via international travelers and became a serious problem of public health worldwide. To date several isolated SARS-CoV infections are still occurring mainly in Asia although the major outbreak has been contained since 2003. This indicates that the SARS-CoV infection still represents a threat for the public health. In the absence of an effective therapy against SARS, the development of an effective vaccine is still needed.\r\n The SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome of 29,727 nucleotides that encodes four structural proteins including the spike glycoprotein (S), the nucleocapsid protein (N), the membrane protein (M) and the small envelope glycoprotein (E), and several nonstructural proteins most of which, like in other coronaviruses, are of unknown functions (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . The spike S protein binds to members of the DC-SIGN family and to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Jeffers et al., 2004; Li et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2004) , thereby mediating the entry of the virus into the target cells. Therefore, this protein represents a good target for vaccine development against SARS-CoV.\r\n Exosomes released from dendritic cells or cancer cells have been proposed as vaccine candidates for immunotherapy of tumors (Andre et al., 2001 Chaput et al., 2003 Chaput et al., , 2005 Delcayre et al., 2005; Taieb et al., 2005; Zitvogel et al., 1998) . They are small membrane vesicles with a diameter of 30 to 100 nm, which are released via multivesicular bodies from a variety of different cell types . The proteomic profile of exosomes differs substantially from that of cell lysates (Amigorena, 2000; Mears et al., 2004) . A number of cellular proteins, such as tetraspanins, heat shock proteins or MHC-I molecules are enriched in these vesicles (Denzer et al., 2000; Peche et al., 2003; Admyre et al., 2003; Hemler, 2003; Andre et al., 2004) .\r\n Exosomes can be taken-up by dendritic cells, leading to presentation of MHC-I\/peptide complexes from the exosomes by the dendritic cells (Andre et al., 2004) . Cellular components of the exosomes such as heat shock proteins were reported to enhance the immunogenicity and efficacy of exosome-based cancer vaccines (Chen et al., 2006) . We therefore analyzed, whether the exosomal vaccine approach could also be exploited for the development of vaccines against enveloped viruses, such as the SARS coronavirus. To incorporate the S protein of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-S) into exosomes the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of SARS-S were replaced by those of the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus. This chimeric protein (S GTM ) was efficiently expressed on the cell surface, allowed entry of pseudotyped retroviral vectors, and was incorporated into exosomes. S GTM -containing exosomes were tested for their immunogenicity in mouse models as a novel protein vaccine against the SARS-CoV. Given the immunostimulatory properties of VSV-G (Marsac et al., 2002; Kuate et al., 2006) , we also explored the immunogenicity of exosomes generated from cells coexpressing SARS-S and VSV-G.\r\n The S protein of the SARS-CoV, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, is composed of an ectodomain (amino acids 17-1195), a transmembrane domain (TM) (amino acids 1196-1218), and a cytoplasmic domain (CD) (amino acids 1219 to 1255) (Giroglou et al., 2004; Spiga et al., 2003; Zeng et al., 2004) . To generate the expression plasmid for the chimeric S protein, the coding region for the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the S protein were replaced by those of VSV-G ( GTM ). A schematic representation of the encoded recombinant polypeptides is shown in Fig. 1A .\r\n In order to assess the expression of the recombinant proteins, cell lysates from 293T cells transiently transfected with different SARS-CoV-S expression plasmids were analyzed by Western blot. For the detection of the S protein, a polyclonal antiserum raised against amino acids 441-453 of the S1 subunit was used. As shown in Fig. 1B the wild-type as well as the recombinant proteins were expressed in transfected cells. The S precursor polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 180 kDa could be detected in samples transfected with pS wt or pS GTM . The antiserum also reacted with a cellular protein with an approximate molecular weight of 100 kDa (Fig. 1B) .\r\n The fusion of the ectodomain of the S protein to the Nterminus of the TM of VSV-G should lead to expression of the hybrid protein in a membrane-bound form. The results of immunofluorescence staining ( Fig. 2A ) of transfected 293T cells with a SARS-convalescent serum indeed suggest such a localization for S wt and S GTM . To further confirm cell surface expression, 293T cells transfected with S expression plasmids were stained with a SARS-convalescent serum without disrupting the cellular membrane. As shown in Fig. 2B the wild type as well as the hybrid S proteins were expressed on the cell surface. The mean fluorescence intensity of cells expressing S GTM was higher compared to that of cells expressing S wt (Fig.  2B ). To further compare expression levels of S GTM and S wt on the surface of the cell, surface proteins of transfected cells were biotinylated, lysed and precipitated by avidin-coupled beads. Western blot analysis of the precipitates revealed efficient expression of S GTM but not S wt on the surface of the cell (Fig.  2C , right panel). Both proteins could be detected in total cell lysates (Fig. 2C, left panel) . These results indicate that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of VSV-G mediate more efficient transport of the S protein ectodomain to the cell membrane than the homologous domains.\r\n The production of a fully functional hybrid S protein retaining much of the conformation of the parental S protein is important for vaccine design, since neutralizing antibodies generated after immunization with the hybrid S protein should also be able to neutralize the wild-type SARS-CoV. In addition, it could be beneficial if receptor induced conformational changes of the hybrid S protein also mimic those of the parental S protein. To test whether the S GTM protein is functionally active, SIV, HIV, and MLV-based vectors were pseudotyped with either the wild-type or the hybrid S protein. Vector titers were determined on ACE2-transfected 293T cells, which were more susceptible for vector transduction than VeroE6 cells (data not shown). Infectious SIV, HIV and MLV vectors were obtained using the hybrid S protein (S GTM ). Titers in the absence of a viral surface protein were below 5 GFU\/ml. Incorporation of S GTM into vector particles (Fig. 3A ) seemed to correlate with the titers obtained for SIV, HIV-1, or MLV vectors (Fig. 3B) , while similar titers were obtained for all three vectors after pseudotyping with VSV-G. Vector titers of S GTM pseudotypes were only 1.5-to 2.7-fold higher than those obtained by pseudotyping with S wt , although the latter could hardly be detected in the particle preparations.\r\n The high efficiency of expression of S GTM on the surface of cells may also lead to increased incorporation into exosomes released from transfected cells. In order to assess this, Western blot analyses were performed on pelleted vesicles from pS wtand pS GTM -transfected cells using anti-S1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4A , the S protein could not be detected in the sample from pS wt -transfected cells. In contrast, the S GTM protein could be detected in the pelleted supernatant of pS GTM -transfected cells. We also checked for the presence of proteins characteristic for exosomes including a heat shock protein (HSP90) and the tetraspanin protein CD82. Western blot analysis of vesicles derived from cells transfected with pS GTM revealed the presence of both proteins with a molecular weight of 90 kDa and 45 kDa respectively (Fig. 4A ). In addition to these expected proteins, the Western blot analysis with the anti-CD82 antibody revealed incorporation of an unknown protein with a molecular weight of about 85 kDa. In contrast, HSP90, CD82, and the CD82 related protein were not detectable in blots of samples from pS wt -or mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4A) . The presence of HSP90 and CD82 proteins correlated with incorporation of the S GTM into pelletable vesicles, indicating that S GTM , but not the wild-type S protein (S wt ) may enhance release of exosomes into the conditioned media.\r\n In order to check if S GTM was membrane bound, S GTM was pelleted from the supernatant of transfected cells through a 20% sucrose cushion, resuspended, and incubated with n-octyl-\u03b2-Dglucopyranoside (OG), a mild detergent solubilizing lipid membranes. The OG-treated sample was layered on a 20% sucrose cushion followed by ultracentrifugation and Western blot analysis of the pellet and the concentrated supernatant ( Fig.  4B ). After OG treatment, S GTM was almost exclusively found in the supernatant. The absence of S GTM in the pellet was not due to loss of S GTM during the whole procedure, since S GTM could Cells transfected transiently with the indicated expression plasmids were incubated with a convalescent serum of a SARS patient and bound antibodies were detected using an FITC-conjugated anti-human secondary antibody. The upper panel represents the 10-fold magnification of the image and the lower panel a 40-fold magnification. (B) FACS analysis. 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmid encoding the wild-type S protein (S wt ) or the hybrid protein (S GTM ) and FACS analysis was performed on intact cells using SARS patient serum and FITC-conjugated anti human IgG. The level of protein expression was expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). As negative control, mock-transfected cells were used. (C) Biotinylation assay. 293T cells were transfected with the expression plasmid for the indicated S proteins. Half of the transfected cells were lysed directly, while the extracellular domains of the membrane proteins of the other half were first biotinylated and then precipitated by avidin beads. Both, lysates from transfected cells (cell lysate) and the biotinylated and precipitated surface proteins (cell surface) were analyzed by Western blot with the S1 antiserum. Numbers on the left-hand side of the figures indicate the position of molecular weight size markers. be repelleted in the absence of OG (Fig. 4B) . Thus, S GTM seems to be incorporated into membrane vesicles released from transfected cells and resembling exosomal structures.\r\n To test the immunogenicity of the SARS-S-containing exosomes, 293T cells were transiently transfected with the S GTM expression plasmid. The serum-free conditioned media were harvested and the exosomes were partially purified by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion. Since we previously observed that incorporation of VSV-G into immunodeficiency virus-like particles enhanced immune responses to HIV-1 Gag (Kuate et al., 2006) , we also coexpressed VSV-G and S GTM in 293T cells and purified the released exosomes by ultracentrifugation. Both exosome preparations contained similar amounts of S GTM (Fig. 4C , left panel). The preparation of exosomes from cells coexpressing VSV-G and SARS-S (G + S GTM ) contained both proteins (Fig 4C, right panel) . In this Western blot analysis, both proteins were detected using an antibody recognizing the cytoplasmic domain of VSV-G. The ratio of the band intensities of the S GTM and VSV-G proteins therefore indicates that in the vaccine preparation VSV-G is present at molar excess (Fig. 4C, right panel) . These exosomebased vaccines were compared to an adenoviral vector expressing S GTM , since adenoviral vector vaccines were shown to induce strong immune responses to a broad spectrum of antigens encoded by the adenoviral vector. The adenoviral S GTM vector was constructed using a modified pAd-Easy system (He et al., 1998; Kuate et al., 2004) . The adenoviral vector was purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation and expression of S GTM was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). We also explored a prime-boost regimen of priming with the exosomal vaccine and boosting with the adenoviral vector vaccine.\r\n A single injection of the adenoviral vector expressing S GTM induced antibodies binding to SARS-S expressed in murine B16 cells (Fig. 5A ). For the exosomal vaccines two injections were required to induce similar antibody levels to SARS-S (Fig. 5B ). Coexpression of VSV-G and SARS-S (G + S GTM ) only led to a slight increase in antibody levels to SARS-S, while the highest antibody levels were obtained after priming with S GTM exosomes and boosting with the adenoviral vector vaccine (Fig. 5, right panel) . Although the binding antibody levels were significantly higher in all vaccinated groups compared to the non-vaccinated control group (p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA on log-transformed MFI), the differences between the vaccinated groups did not reach statistical significance.\r\n For the determination of the neutralizing antibody titers, Spseudotyped retroviral vector-based (Figs. 6A, B) and wildtype SARS-CoV-based ( Fig. 6C ) neutralization assays were performed. When using S-pseudotypes for the neutralization assay, the highest serum dilution reducing vector infectivity by more than 90% was determined, in order to avoid minor unspecific inhibitory effects of sera at high concentrations. The highest neutralizing antibody titers were obtained in animals that were primed with S GTM and boosted with Ad-S GTM vectors (Fig. 6A ). Comparison of neutralizing antibody titers of this group to the group immunized once with Ad-S GTM indicates that S GTM immunization had a priming effect (Fig.  6A ). Two injections of the exosomal S GTM vaccine also induced substantial neutralizing antibody titers that were slightly higher if VSV-G was included in the exosomal vaccine (Fig. 6A) . The neutralizing antibodies specifically inhibited SARS-S-mediated entry, since the same sera did not reduce the titer of retroviral vectors containing the amphotropic MLV-Env instead of SARS-S (Fig. 6A) .\r\n To compare the neutralizing activity of the antibodies obtained from immunized mice to that obtained during natural SARS coronavirus infection in humans, a convalescent serum of a SARS patient obtained 10 weeks after onset of symptoms was analyzed side by side with selected mouse sera using the pseudotyped retroviral vector. Sera from S GTM + Ad-S GTMimmunized mice inhibited vector infectivity more efficiently than the convalescent serum of the SARS patient (Fig. 6B) . To confirm, that the antibodies inhibiting entry of SARS-Spseudotyped retroviral vectors, also neutralize wild-type SARS-CoV, pooled antisera from the group of mice receiving two S GTM injections or an S GTM prime and adenoviral vector boost immunization were tested in a virus neutralization assay. Consistently, the highest neutralizing activity was obtained for the S GTM prime adenoviral vector boost regimen, which induced higher titers of neutralizing antibodies than those detected in the convalescent serum of the SARS patient (Fig. 6C ).\r\n A tumor challenge model was established to explore the relative efficacy of different SARS-S-based vaccines. To this end B16 melanoma cells were established stably expressing the wild-type SARS-S protein. Non-immunized mice inoculated with these cells develop tumors within 1 or 2 weeks after injection (Fig. 7A, 7B ). Immunized mice were challenged with the tumor cells 2 weeks after a single immunization or 1 week after the booster immunization. For single immunizations, the rate of tumor growth was slightly delayed in vaccinated animals compared to the controls (Fig. 7A ). This delay was more pronounced in Ad-S GTM -immunized animals. To compare the rate of tumor growth in the different vaccine groups, one-way ANOVA test was performed on log-transformed tumor volume at day 15 after challenge. At this time point the tumor volume in some of the control animals already reached 3500 mm 3 (Fig.  7A ). Larger tumor volumes were observed in control animals compared with that obtained in the vaccine groups. However, a statistically significant difference in tumor growth was found only between control group and Ad-S GTM -immunized animals (p < 0.05).\r\n For prime-boost immunization regimen, the same pattern of tumor growth in the control mice as in single immunization regimen was observed. In all vaccinees, the rate of tumor Pelleted S GTM was resuspended, treated (+OG) with n-octyl-\u03b2-Dglucopyranoside, and repelleted through a sucrose cushion by ultracentrifugation. After centrifugation, the pellet was harvested and supernatant (sup) was concentrated by ultrafiltration. The samples obtained (pellet and sup) were analyzed for the presence of the S protein by Western blot using the S1 antiserum. As controls, untreated (\u2212OG) pelleted S GTM , and pellets from the conditioned media of mock-transfected cells (Neg) were processed the same way. (C) Western blot analysis of the exosomal vaccines. Conditioned media from 293T cells transfected with plasmid expressing the hybrid protein together (G+ S GTM ) or not (S GTM ) with that expressing the VSV-G were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and the exosomes were analyzed by Western blot using the S1 antiserum (left panel) or an anti-VSV-G antibody (right panel). Fig. 5 . Binding antibody levels. B16 cells stably expressing the S protein were incubated with sera obtained after a single immunization (A) or the indicated prime-boost regimen (B). After washing to remove unbound antibodies, cells were incubated with FITC-labeled anti-mouse antibodies and FACS analysis was performed to determine the mean fluorescence intensity of the samples. growth was strongly retarded compared to the control animals (Fig. 7B) . As for single immunization, animals that received Ad-S GTM as booster immunization (group S GTM + Ad-S GTM ) controlled efficiently the tumor growth. Control of tumor growth was SARS-S specific as mice immunized twice with S GTM did not control growth of B16 cells not expressing the S protein (data not shown). A comparison of the tumor volume at day 15 post challenge showed no statistically significant difference between vaccine groups (Fig. 7B) . However, statistically significant differences were found when compared the volume of the tumor in control animals to those immunized with S GTM (p < 0.01), G + S GTM (p < 0.001) and S GTM + Ad-S GTM (p < 0.01).\r\n Exchanging the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain of SARS-CoV-S by the corresponding domains of VSV-G altered the cellular fate of the S protein substantially. The cytoplasmic domain of VSV-G has previously been shown to determine the transport pathway (Hart et al., 1994; Andersson et al., 1997) and the basolateral localization of VSV-G in polarized cells (McQueen et al., 1986; Brown et al., 1989; Compton et al., 1989) . Fusing heterologous proteins to Fig. 6 . Neutralization assay. (A) Sera from mice immunized with the indicated vaccines were diluted serially into serum-free DMEM medium and incubated with S-pseudotyped MLV vectors. The cocktail was added in triplicates to 293T cells transiently expressing the ACE2 receptor. Two days later, GFP-positive cells were counted under fluorescence microscope and the highest dilution that led to >90% inhibition of the vector infectivity compared to control infection was taken as the neutralizing antibody titer (closed symbols). The log 2 of the titers is given. Control infections for the specificity of the neutralizing antibodies were performed using MLV-based vectors containing the amphotropic MLV Env (open symbols). (B) Comparison of the neutralization activity of antisera from immunized mice and that of a convalescent SARS patient. The inhibition of S-pseudotyped MLV vectors incubated with different dilutions of a control serum (C-Serum), a serum from a SARS-recovered patient (P-Serum), or sera of mice immunized as indicated was determined. The log 2 of the serum dilution is given on the x-axis. (C) Virus neutralization assay. Vero cells were infected in triplicates with the wild-type SARS-CoV, incubated with different dilutions of antisera from the indicated experimental animal groups, and monitored 3 to 5 days latter for formation of cytopathic effects. The neutralizing antibody titer is presented as the highest dilution of the antisera that prevent cytopathic effects in 66% of the wells. membrane spanning and cytoplasmic domains of VSV-G targeted the heterologous protein to the cell surface and allowed efficient incorporation into viral vector particles (Owens and Rose, 1993; Jin and Wright, 2003) . This was now also observed for the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-S. The S GTM fusion protein was expressed at higher levels at the cell surface compared to the wild-type protein. In comparison to S GTM , incorporation of wild-type S into viral particles was severely reduced. S GTM was not only incorporated into viral particles but was also functionally active as it allowed transduction of ACE2expressing cells with pseudotyped retroviral and lentiviral vectors. This indicates that SARS-S-mediated fusion of the viral membrane with the cellular membrane is not disturbed by the heterologous transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and suggests that neutralizing epitopes of SARS-S are maintained in S GTM .\r\n Transfection of 293T cells with the expression plasmid for S GTM also led to secretion of S GTM . Consistent with an exosomal localization, secreted S GTM seemed to be membrane bound and could be pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion. Western blot analysis of S GTM , but not S wt vesicles or vesicles from mock-transfected cells, revealed the presence of HSP90 and CD82, two of several proteins that are characteristic for exosomes (Wubbolts et al., 2003; Clayton et al., 2005) . Although exosomes are constitutively secreted from several cell types as a consequence of fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane , the lack of detection of these proteins in S wt or mock-derived vesicles suggests that S GTM either induces exosome formation or enhances incorporation of HSP90 and CD82 into the exosomes. It remains to be determined whether this function can be mapped to the transmembrane or more likely to the cytoplasmic domain of VSV-G.\r\n In contrast to soluble protein vaccines, exosomes containing membrane-anchored ectodomains of viral surface proteins should have multiple copies of the same viral protein exposed on the surface of the same exosome thereby facilitating crosslinking of the B cell receptor. In this respect, they mirror virosomal vaccines that are made by reconstitution of purified viral membrane proteins into liposomes. They differ from virosomal vaccines by the fact that exosomes do not only contain the viral protein, but also a wide array of cellular proteins, some of which have been shown to support induction of immune responses. Although exosomal vaccines have been primarily raised interest due to the fact that they allow cross presentation leading to the induction of CD8+ T cell responses, the multimeric presentation of viral surface proteins in their natural confirmation might also efficiently trigger viral surface protein-specific B cell receptors, particularly if cellular components of the exosome provide additional stimulatory signals. Since this could also favor the induction of neutralizing antibodies, we explored the potential of S GTMcontaining exosomes as a novel vaccine approach against SARS coronavirus infections. Two injections of S GTMcontaining xenogenic exosomes without adjuvants were sufficient to induce neutralizing antibody titers. After priming with the SARS-S exosomal vaccine and boosting with an adenoviral vector the neutralizing antibody titers exceeded those of a SARS-convalescent patient serum (Fig. 5C) . In previous immunization studies using soluble S proteins, several immunizations in the presence of adjuvant were necessary to generate reasonable neutralizing antibody titers (Keng et al., 2005) .\r\n We previously observed that incorporation of fusioncompetent, but not fusion-deficient VSV-G into HIV-1-based VLPs led to an approximate 100-fold increase of antibody titers against the HIV-1 capsid protein (Kuate et al., 2006) . This indicates that the fusion activity of VSV-G is required for its immunostimulatory properties and suggests that VSV-G-mediated shuttling of VLP-associated antigens into particular cellular compartments can dramatically enhance humoral immune responses. However, incorporation of VSV-G into S GTM -containing exosomes did not lead to a significant increase in binding or neutralizing antibodies against SARS-S. Since S GTM itself is fusion-competent, the enhancing effect of fusion-competent VSV-G might be masked. Alternatively, the immunostimulatory properties of VSV-G might differ depending on the type of co-administered antigen. After fusion of the exosomal membrane with the endosomal membrane, the large ectodomain of the membrane anchored S GTM should be in the lumen of the endosome, while HIV-1 capsid proteins localized within the VLP should reach the cytoplasm. Although VSV-G and S GTM contain the same cytoplasmic domain directing intracellular trafficking we cannot formally exclude the possibility that VSV-G and S GTM are localized on different exosomes, which might also explain the poor enhancing effect of VSV-G on SARS-S antibody titers.\r\n Since the S GTM -containing exosomes were prepared from human cells, they are expected to contain a number of human proteins, which might be targeted by the murine immune response. We therefore also determined the immunogenicity of an adenoviral vector expressing S GTM . Injection of this adenoviral vector into mice should lead to expression of S GTM in the vaccinees and subsequent release of exosomes containing S GTM , but no other heterologous proteins. A single injection of the S GTM -expressing adenoviral vector induced neutralizing antibodies and reduced the growth of SARS-Sexpressing tumor cells confirming the immunogenicity of adenoviral vector vaccines. Whether the release of S GTMcontaining exosomes in vivo contributes to the strong immune responses observed remains to be determined. Immune responses to the adenoviral vector particle limit repeated application of adenoviral vector vaccines (Bangari and Mittal, 2006; Barouch et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2003) . We therefore used a prime-boost regimen consisting of S GTM -containing exosomes followed by the adenoviral vector boost. This primeboost regimen induced the highest neutralizing antibody titers, which exceeded the titers obtained after a single adenoviral vector immunization or two doses of S GTM -containing exosomes.\r\n The neutralizing antibody titers induced by immunization paralleled the efficiency of control of growth of SARS-Sexpressing tumor cells. All mice receiving the heterologous or homologous prime-boost regimens were able to inhibit tumor growth. A single injection of the S GTM -expressing adenoviral vector inhibited tumor growth to a similar extent as the primeboost regimens. However, only transient suppression of the tumor growth was observed. This growth pattern was previously described for ovalbumin-immunized mice challenged with B16 cells stably expressing ovalbumin (MO4) (Bonifaz et al., 2004) . Selection of tumor cells not expressing SARS-S and their subsequent outgrowth might explain this observation.\r\n We have chosen this tumor challenge model to avoid work with infectious SARS coronavirus. Although we do not know at present, whether this model predicts vaccine efficacy against SARS coronavirus infections in animal models or in humans, it represents an additional parameter allowing preclinical ranking of different vaccine approaches to be further evaluated. Since S GTM -containing exosomes and S GTM -expressing adenoviral vectors induce neutralizing antibody titers that exceed those observed in the convalescent serum of a SARS patient if combined in prime-boost regimen and since humoral immunity alone could control coronavirus replication in a murine model , both approaches warrant further investigation.\r\n The human embryonic kidney cell derivative 293T (DuBridge et al., 1987) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), Lglutamine, penicillin and streptomycin. Vero cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 10% FCS.\r\n The plasmids pLEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-C1 were purchased from Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany. The construction of the plasmids VCG\u0394BH Sgp\u03942 (Schnell et al., 2000) Hgpsyn (Wagner et al., 2000) , pHIT-G (Fouchier et al., 1997) , HIV-CL-CG (Miyoshi et al., 1998 ), pcTatRev (Southgate et al., 1990 , pCAGG-S and pCDNA-ACE\/Z (Hofmann and Pohlmann, 2004) has been described. For the construction of the expression plasmids for the chimeric S proteins, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Chapple and Jones, 2002 ) of a codon-optimized version of the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus were amplified from the plasmid pCD-Gsyn (unpublished data) using the primers 5\u2032atttaaatgaatcactcattgaccttcaagaattgggaaaatatgagcaatatattaaatggcctttcggcgacaccggcctgagcaagaaccccatc and 5\u2032 acaagctgctagccagccatagagcccaccgcatccccagcat, flanked with the restriction enzymes SwaI and NheI respectively. The PCR product was digested with SwaI and NheI, and inserted in frame into the SwaI-NheI digested pS wt (pCAGG-S (Hofmann et al.,  2004) ) generating pS GTM .\r\n 293T cells were plated into 25 cm 2 flasks and transfected 1 day later with 10 \u03bcg of pS wt or pS GTM together with 1 \u03bcg of GFP-expressing plasmid (pEGFP-C1) in order to monitor transfection efficiency. Two days later, transfected cells were resuspended into 200 \u03bcl of protein loading buffer and samples were denatured at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. Fifteen microliters of each sample was thereafter separated using 10% SDS-PAGE and the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell Bioscience, Dassel, Germany) using standard techniques. Blots were subsequently incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit antiserum raised against S1 (Biomol GmBH, Hamburg, Germany), then with 1:2000 diluted goat anti-rabbit antiserum conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany). After washings, protein bands were detected using a commercially available chemiluminescence's Western blot detection kit (Biozym Scientific GmBH, Oldendorf, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\r\n 293T cells were plated into 25 cm 2 flasks and transfected 1 day later with 5 \u03bcg of pS wt , pS GTM or carrier DNA. Two days later, cells were detached from the flasks using 20 mM of EDTA in PBS, washed two times with PBS and transferred onto slides by centrifugation using a cytospin centrifuge (Shandon, Biomedical polymer Inc., Gardner, USA). Cells were thereafter fixed for 10 min in cold acetone, and then incubated for 1 h with 30 \u03bcl of 1:50 diluted serum obtained from a SARS patient 10 weeks after his hospitalization. After washing to eliminate unbound antibodies, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with 30 \u03bcl of FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG (DakoCytomation GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), diluted 1:20 into 0.1% of Evan's blue solution. After another washing step the presence of green cells was monitored under a fluorescence microscope and pictures were taken.\r\n Cells were plated and transfected as described above with 5 \u03bcg of the pS wt or pS GTM . Two days after transfection, cells were detached from the flask as described for the immunofluorescence assay and washed three times with the FACS buffer (2% FCS in PBS). 10 6 cells\/well were transferred into 96-well, v-bottom microtiter plates and incubated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with 100 \u03bcl of patient serum diluted 1:50 into FACS buffer. After three washes with FACS buffer, cells were incubated for 20 min in the dark at 4\u00b0C with 100 \u03bcl of FITC-conjugated antihuman IgG diluted 1:100 in FACS buffer containing propidium iodide. After washing, cells were analyzed using FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). For the biotinylation assay, 293T cells were transfected with 10 \u03bcg of the plasmids expressing the wild-type S proteins or its mutant. Two days later half of the cells were lysed in loading buffer and used for SDS-PAGE, while the other half was used for biotinylation of surface proteins essentially as previously described (Sandrin et al., 2004) .\r\n To produce S-pseudotyped vectors, 293T cells were plated into 175 cm 2 flasks at a density of 8 \u00d7 10 6 cells\/flask and transfected 1 day later with 20 \u03bcg each of the vector plasmid (VCG\u0394BH, HIV-CL-CG or pLEGFP-N1) and the packaging plasmid (Sgp\u03942, Hgpsyn or pHIT-60 respectively), and 10 \u03bcg of the envelope expressing plasmid (pS wt , pS GTM or pHIT-G) as described above. For the production of HIV-based vectors, 5 \u03bcg of the plasmid pcTatRev was also cotransfected. Eight hours after transfection, the conditioned media were discarded and cells were fed with 20 ml of fresh serum-free medium (AIM-V Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). One day later, the conditioned media were harvested, cleared from cell debris by low speed centrifugation and passed through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter. To determine the vector titer, 293T cells transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing ACE2 were plated into 24-well plates at the density of 5 \u00d7 10 4 cells\/well and infected 1 day later with serial dilutions of the conditioned media. Two days later, GFP-positive cells were counted under a fluorescence microscope and the vector titers were calculated from the number of GFP-positive cells\/ well.\r\n 293T cells were plated in 175 cm 2 tissue culture flask at a density of 8 \u00d7 10 6 cells\/flask and transfected 1 day later with either S wt -or S GTM -expressing plasmid. Two days after transfection, the conditioned media were harvested and the vesicles containing in these media were pelleted by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose cushion. Western blot analysis using an anti-S1 antibody was performed to directly compare the incorporation of the wild-type S (S wt ) and the hybrid (S GTM ) proteins into the vesicles. The pelleted vesicles were also subjected to Western blot analysis as described above, using 1:300 diluted mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against HSP90 or CD82 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) respectively.\r\n For the preparation of the exosomal vaccines, 293T cells were plated as described above and transfected 1 day later with 80 \u03bcg of plasmid expressing the S GTM together or not with 40 \u03bcg of plasmid expressing the G protein of VSV-G. Eight hours after transfection, cells were fed with 20 ml fresh serumfree medium (AIM-V, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). One day later the conditioned media were harvested and the exosomes were concentrated by ultracentrifugation as described above. The pellets were resuspended into PBS and used for Western blot analysis or kept at \u2212 80\u00b0C for further experiments. In order to assess the membrane-bound nature of the S GTM , resuspended pellets obtained from the supernatant of transfected cells by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion, were incubated for 4 h at 4\u00b0C with 30 mM of n-octyl-\u03b2-Dglucopyranoside (OG) (Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany) under gentle shacking in order to solubilize the cell membrane.\r\n The treated and untreated (used as control) samples were repelleted through 20% sucrose (containing 60 mM of OG) as described above. To assess the solubilization of the S protein, the supernatant of the OG-treated sample was collected after centrifugation and concentrated approximately 50-fold using Vivaspin ultrafiltration spin column with a cut-off molecular weight of 10, 000 (Vivaspin AG, Goetingen, Germany) as described by the manufacturer. The presence of the S protein in different sample preparations was assessed by Western blot analysis. For all experiments, the conditioned media from mock-transfected cells were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and used as negative control.\r\n For animal experiments, 30 \u03bcg total protein of each exosomal vaccine was used per inoculation, as similar amount of the S protein was observed in Western blot analysis of different vaccine preparations. For the production of the recombinant adenoviral vector expressing the hybrid S GTM protein, the S GTM gene was subcloned from the pS GTM plasmid into the pShuttle-CMVTeto2 plasmid to generate pS-TetO2-S GTM . For the homologous recombination, BJ-5183 bacteria cells were co-transformed by electroporation with the linearized pS-TetO2-S GTM recombinant plasmid and the pAd-easy1 (He et al., 1998) . The resulting recombinant plasmid was digested with PacI and transfected into 293 T-Rex cells for viral production. Adenoviral particles were amplified in the same cells and purified by standard cesium-chloride gradient centrifugation as previously described . The particle concentration of the vector particles was determined by optical density measurement as previously described (Mittereder et al., 1996) .\r\n For the immunization five groups of 6-to 7-week-old BL57\/6 mice (Charles River Wiga GmBH, Sulzfeld, Germany) were injected at the footpad, each with 30 \u03bcg (total protein) of the exosomal vaccines. For single immunization, animals (n = 6\/group) received either S GTM (group S GTM ), S GTM with VSV-G (group G + S GTM ) or 5\u00d710 9 particles of recombinant adenoviral vector expressing S GTM (group Ad-S GTM ). Two weeks later blood samples were collected retroorbitally and animals were challenged by injection at the right flank of 2 \u00d7 10 6 B16 melanoma cells stably expressing the wild-type S protein (B16-S). As negative control, six na\u00efve mice were also challenged with B16-S cells. For the primeboost experiment, animals (n = 5\/group) either received two injections of S GTM (group 2 \u00d7 S GTM ) or two injection of S GTM with VSV-G (group 2 \u00d7 G + S GTM ) on weeks 0 and 5. One group (S GTM + Ad-S GTM ) was primed with S GTM on week 0 and boosted 5 weeks later with Ad-S GTM . One week after the last immunization, blood samples were collected and animals were challenged with B16-S cells as described above. The tumor growth was monitored daily and the volume of the tumor was determined every 3 days. The animals were sacrificed when the tumor volume exceeded 3500 mm 3 . To assess the specificity of tumor suppression, mice (n = 3) were immunized on weeks 0 and 5 with S GTM vaccines and challenged on week 6 with 2 \u00d7 10 6 B16 cells not expressing the S protein.\r\n For the analysis of the binding antibodies, B16-S cells were plated at a density of 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells\/well into U-bottom 96-well plates and incubated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with 1:50 dilution of sera collected from immunized and na\u00efve control animals. Cells were thereafter washed twice with FACS buffer and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 100 \u03bcl of 1:100 diluted FITC-labeled monoclonal antibodies against mouse immunoglobulin (DakoCytomation GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). After another series of 2 washes, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry as described above and the amounts of antibodies were expressed as mean fluorescence intensity.\r\n For the determination of the neutralizing antibody titers, Spseudotyped MLV vectors were produced as described above. For the infection, 293T cells transiently expressing the ACE2 proteins were plated into 96-well plates at a density of 2 \u00d7 10 4 cells\/well. One day later, different dilutions of the sera were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with vector particles and the mixtures were added in triplicate to the cells. Two days after infection GFP-expressing cells were counted under fluorescence microscope and the 90% neutralization titer was determined as the highest serum dilution inhibiting infection by more than 90%. In order to check the specificity of the neutralization assay, the same assay was performed using MLV vectors containing amphotropic MLV-Env. We further compared the neutralizing properties of the antisera from immunized mice to that from a SARS-recovered patient. Two antisera were chosen for the experiment: one with the lowest neutralizing antibody titer (from the S GTM group) and another one with the highest titer (from the S GTM + Ad-S GTM group). These antisera together with that from a SARS-recovered patient were serially diluted and incubated with S-pseudotyped MLV vectors. Subsequently, 293T cells expressing the ACE2 receptor were infected with these samples. Two days later the number of GFPpositive cells was used to calculate the percentage of the vector infectivity. A control human antiserum was used to assess the specificity of the inhibition.\r\n An additional neutralization assay was performed using wild-type SARS-CoV (Frankfurt 1 strain). Antisera from each group of immunized animals from the prime\/boost regimen were pooled and serial dilutions of these antisera were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with 100 TCID 50 \/well of SARS-CoV, and the mixtures were added in triplicates to fresh Vero cells. As a negative control fresh media instead of virus\/ antisera mixtures were added to the cells. After 3 to 5 days of incubation, cells were monitored under the microscope for CPE formation. The neutralizing antibody titer was given as the inverse of the serum dilution that prevents cytopathic effect in 66% of wells. An antiserum from a convalescent SARS patient, differing from the patient the Frankfurt 1 SARS strain was isolated from, was also included in the assay for a direct comparison of its neutralizing properties with those of the antisera from immunized mice.\r\n For the statistical analysis, the software GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used. Oneway ANOVA analysis was performed on log-transformed data and the post test was performed if the overall P was less than 0.05. For the post test, the Bonferroni's multiple comparison test was performed. To compare the neutralizing antibody titers between groups, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was performed.","sha":"c5019620a14eff41b9e38d681e0c8aa5cede332d","publish_time":"2007-05-25","authors":"Kuate, Seraphin; Cinatl, Jindrich; Doerr, Hans Wilhelm; \u00dcberla, Klaus","journal":"Virology","doi":"10.1016\/j.virol.2006.12.011","Title":"Virology","H index":162.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"First reported in 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by the newly emerged human coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., We therefore analyzed, whether the exosomal vaccine approach could also be exploited for the development of vaccines against enveloped viruses, such as the SARS coronavirus. This chimeric protein (S GTM ) was efficiently expressed on the cell surface, allowed entry of pseudotyped retroviral vectors, and was incorporated into exosomes. S GTM -containing exosomes were tested for their immunogenicity in mouse models as a novel protein vaccine against the SARS-CoV. Given the immunostimulatory properties of VSV-G (Marsac et al., To generate the expression plasmid for the chimeric S protein, the coding region for the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the S protein were replaced by those of VSV-G ( GTM ). A schematic representation of the encoded recombinant polypeptides is shown in Fig. 1B the wild-type as well as the recombinant proteins were expressed in transfected cells. The S precursor polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 180 kDa could be detected in samples transfected with pS wt or pS GTM . The results of immunofluorescence staining ( Fig. Western blot analysis of the precipitates revealed efficient expression of S GTM but not S wt on the surface of the cell (Fig. Titers in the absence of a viral surface protein were below 5 GFU\/ml. In contrast, the S GTM protein could be detected in the pelleted supernatant of pS GTM -transfected cells. In addition to these expected proteins, the Western blot analysis with the anti-CD82 antibody revealed incorporation of an unknown protein with a molecular weight of about 85 kDa. The presence of HSP90 and CD82 proteins correlated with incorporation of the S GTM into pelletable vesicles, indicating that S GTM , but not the wild-type S protein (S wt ) may enhance release of exosomes into the conditioned media. The upper panel represents the 10-fold magnification of the image and the lower panel a 40-fold magnification. ( To test the immunogenicity of the SARS-S-containing exosomes, 293T cells were transiently transfected with the S GTM expression plasmid. Since we previously observed that incorporation of VSV-G into immunodeficiency virus-like particles enhanced immune responses to HIV-1 Gag (Kuate et al., The preparation of exosomes from cells coexpressing VSV-G and SARS-S (G + S GTM ) contained both proteins (Fig 4C, right panel) . The adenoviral vector was purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation and expression of S GTM was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). 6A, B) and wildtype SARS-CoV-based ( Fig. 6C ) neutralization assays were performed. The neutralizing antibodies specifically inhibited SARS-S-mediated entry, since the same sera did not reduce the titer of retroviral vectors containing the amphotropic MLV-Env instead of SARS-S (Fig. Consistently, the highest neutralizing activity was obtained for the S GTM prime adenoviral vector boost regimen, which induced higher titers of neutralizing antibodies than those detected in the convalescent serum of the SARS patient (Fig. For single immunizations, the rate of tumor growth was slightly delayed in vaccinated animals compared to the controls (Fig. To compare the rate of tumor growth in the different vaccine groups, one-way ANOVA test was performed on log-transformed tumor volume at day 15 after challenge. C) Western blot analysis of the exosomal vaccines. However, statistically significant differences were found when compared the volume of the tumor in control animals to those immunized with S GTM (p < 0.01), G + S GTM (p < 0.001) and S GTM + Ad-S GTM (p < 0.01). The cocktail was added in triplicates to 293T cells transiently expressing the ACE2 receptor. B) Comparison of the neutralization activity of antisera from immunized mice and that of a convalescent SARS patient. The inhibition of S-pseudotyped MLV vectors incubated with different dilutions of a control serum (C-Serum), a serum from a SARS-recovered patient (P-Serum), or sera of mice immunized as indicated was determined. The neutralizing antibody titer is presented as the highest dilution of the antisera that prevent cytopathic effects in 66% of the wells. This indicates that SARS-S-mediated fusion of the viral membrane with the cellular membrane is not disturbed by the heterologous transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and suggests that neutralizing epitopes of SARS-S are maintained in S GTM . Western blot analysis of S GTM , but not S wt vesicles or vesicles from mock-transfected cells, revealed the presence of HSP90 and CD82, two of several proteins that are characteristic for exosomes (Wubbolts et al., It remains to be determined whether this function can be mapped to the transmembrane or more likely to the cytoplasmic domain of VSV-G.\r\n In contrast to soluble protein vaccines, exosomes containing membrane-anchored ectodomains of viral surface proteins should have multiple copies of the same viral protein exposed on the surface of the same exosome thereby facilitating crosslinking of the B cell receptor. They differ from virosomal vaccines by the fact that exosomes do not only contain the viral protein, but also a wide array of cellular proteins, some of which have been shown to support induction of immune responses. We therefore used a prime-boost regimen consisting of S GTM -containing exosomes followed by the adenoviral vector boost. All mice receiving the heterologous or homologous prime-boost regimens were able to inhibit tumor growth. We have chosen this tumor challenge model to avoid work with infectious SARS coronavirus. The human embryonic kidney cell derivative 293T (DuBridge et al., Vero cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 10% FCS. For the construction of the expression plasmids for the chimeric S proteins, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Chapple and Jones, 2002 ) of a codon-optimized version of the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus were amplified from the plasmid pCD-Gsyn (unpublished data) using the primers 5\u2032atttaaatgaatcactcattgaccttcaagaattgggaaaatatgagcaatatattaaatggcctttcggcgacaccggcctgagcaagaaccccatc and 5\u2032 acaagctgctagccagccatagagcccaccgcatccccagcat, flanked with the restriction enzymes SwaI and NheI respectively. 293T cells were plated into 25 cm 2 flasks and transfected 1 day later with 10 \u03bcg of pS wt or pS GTM together with 1 \u03bcg of GFP-expressing plasmid (pEGFP-C1) in order to monitor transfection efficiency. After washings, protein bands were detected using a commercially available chemiluminescence's Western blot detection kit (Biozym Scientific GmBH, Oldendorf, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated and transfected as described above with 5 \u03bcg of the pS wt or pS GTM . Two days later half of the cells were lysed in loading buffer and used for SDS-PAGE, while the other half was used for biotinylation of surface proteins essentially as previously described (Sandrin et al., One day later, the conditioned media were harvested, cleared from cell debris by low speed centrifugation and passed through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter. Two days after transfection, the conditioned media were harvested and the vesicles containing in these media were pelleted by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose cushion. Western blot analysis using an anti-S1 antibody was performed to directly compare the incorporation of the wild-type S (S wt ) and the hybrid (S GTM ) proteins into the vesicles. For the preparation of the exosomal vaccines, 293T cells were plated as described above and transfected 1 day later with 80 \u03bcg of plasmid expressing the S GTM together or not with 40 \u03bcg of plasmid expressing the G protein of VSV-G.

The presence of the S protein in different sample preparations was assessed by Western blot analysis. For all experiments, the conditioned media from mock-transfected cells were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and used as negative control. For the homologous recombination, BJ-5183 bacteria cells were co-transformed by electroporation with the linearized pS-TetO2-S GTM recombinant plasmid and the pAd-easy1 (He et al., For the primeboost experiment, animals (n = 5\/group) either received two injections of S GTM (group 2 \u00d7 S GTM ) or two injection of S GTM with VSV-G (group 2 \u00d7 G + S GTM ) on weeks 0 and 5. One week after the last immunization, blood samples were collected and animals were challenged with B16-S cells as described above.

This study first demonstrated that the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV interacted with cellular retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and Nsp9 co-localized with pRb in the cytoplasm of PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Next, the overexpression of truncated pRb was shown to inhibit the PRRSV replication and silencing the pRb gene could facilitate the PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. Finally, the pRb level was confirmed to be down-regulated in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, and Nsp9 was shown to promote the pRb degradation by proteasome pathway.

The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), belongs to the Arterivirus genus of the Arteriviridae family, together with equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (Cavanagh, 1997) . The PRRSV is divided into two major genotypes, genotype 1 (European) and genotype 2 (North American) (Nelson et al., 1993) . Clinically, the viruses of the two genotypes cause a similar syndrome although they share only approximately 60% nucleotide identity of the genome (Meng et al., 1995; Nelson et al., 1993) . In China, a highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) of genotype 2 was recognized to cause atypical PRRS outbreaks in the pig-producing areas in 2006 (Tian et al., 2007; Zhou and Yang, 2010) . A recent investigation indicated that the HP-PRRSV has become the dominating virus circulating in pig farms during the past years .\r\n The PRRSV genome is a single strand positive RNA with approximately 15 kb in length, which encodes at least ten open reading frames (ORFs) comprising of ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORFs3-7 and the newly discovered ORF5a (Conzelmann et al., 1993; Firth et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2011; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . ORF1a and ORF1b, the replicase-associated genes, encode two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, respectively. The pp1a is predicated to be cleaved into ten non-structural proteins (Nsps) including Nsp1\u03b1, Nsp1\u03b2, Nsp2 to Nsp6, Nsp7\u03b1, Nsp7\u03b2 and Nsp8 (den Boon et al., 1995; Fang and Snijder, 2010; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; van Aken et al., 2006) , whereas the pp1ab can be cleaved into four Nsps, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp11 and Nsp12, which are considered to be involved in viral replication and genomic transcription (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; van Dinten et al., 1996; Wassenaar et al., 1997) . The transframe fusion (TF) in Nsp2-coding region was recently discovered . In recent years, a growing number of studies have paid much attention to the pathogenesis involved by the Nsps of PRRSV. The Nsp1, Nsp2, Nsp4 and Nsp11 of PRRSV have been shown to inhibit the induction of type I interferon and modulate host innate immune response (Beura et al., 2010; Han et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2010 Sun et al., , 2012 . Moreover, the Nsp1\u03b2 of PRRSV was shown to interact with the cellular poly(C)-binding protein (PCBP) 1 and 2, and this interaction could facilitate viral replication and RNA transcription (Beura et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012) . A latest study indicated that the PRRSV Nsp4 could induce apoptosis dependent on its 3C-like serine protease activity (Tripp et al., 2013) . The Nsp9 of PRRSV, a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is considered to be a major component of membrane-associated viral replication and transcription complex (RTC) that is important for virus replication based on the studies of the equine arteritis virus (EAV) and comparative sequence analysis (Pedersen et al., 1999) . The SDD motif of Nsp9 has been recognized to be critical for its polymerase activity and virus transcription (Zhou et al., 2011) . In addition to its polymerase activity, the interaction between Nsp9 and the host cellular proteins that affect viral replication is poorly understood although a recent study revealed that Nsp9 could interact with endogenous annexin A2 in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells (J. . Moreover, our recent publication has shown that Nsp9 and Nsp10 together not only affected the HP-PRRSV replication and growth in vitro and in vivo, but also contributed to its fatal virulence for piglets (Y. . Thus, further exploring the interaction of Nsp9 with host cellular protein (s) is essential for understanding the roles of Nsp9 in the replication and pathogenesis of HP-PRRSV.\r\n The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) encoded by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene has been shown to modulate cell cycle and suppress human tumors (Khidr and Chen, 2006; Weinberg, 1995) . The proteins that bind to pRb have been recognized to share a conserved motif-LxCxE (Dahiya et al., 2000) , which was first identified in the oncoproteins of DNA tumor viruses (Boyer et al., 1996; White and Khalili, 2006; Whyte et al., 1988) . Some proteins of RNA viruses have been shown to bind to pRb through this motif. The interaction between the Rubella virus Nsp9 and pRb could affect viral replication (Forng and Atreya, 1999) . In coronavirus, the endoribonuclease Nsp15 could bind to pRb, resulting in the acceleration of cell cycle progression (Bhardwaj et al., 2012) . Interestingly, the NS5B of hepatitis C virus (HCV), an RdRp, could interact with pRb and down-regulated the pRb level (Munakata et al., 2005 (Munakata et al., , 2007 . In the present study, we explored the interaction between the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV and pRb and analyzed the effect of this interaction on viral replication in vitro.\r\n The Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV interacted with pRb\r\n The conserved LxCxE motif is a key feature for viral proteins that bind to pRb (Dahiya et al., 2000) . We aligned the amino acid sequences of the Nsp9 among 17 representative strains of genotype 2 PRRSV and found that the Nsp9 of all the analyzed viruses shared an identical LxCxE motif-LACAE (Table 2) . To analyze whether the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV interacts with pRb through the LACAE motif, the recombinant lentiviruses that were expressing Nsp9-GFP, Nsp9 (L415A\/C417A)-GFP and Nsp9 (E419K)-GFP were constructed. MARC-145 cells were transduced with the lentiviruses and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP mAb, and were then detected with an anti-pRb mAb by Co-IP assay. The GFP-expressing lentiviruses were used as the control. As shown in Fig. 1A , the endogenous pRb could be probed in the cells that were expressing Nsp9-GFP and Nsp9 (L415A\/C417A)-GFP, whereas it could not be examined in the cells that were expressing Nsp9 (E419K)-GFP, indicating that Nsp9 interacts with pRb and the third conserved residue (E) of the LACAE motif plays a crucial role in sustaining the interaction between Nsp9 and pRb. To further confirm the interaction of Nsp9 with the exogenous pRb, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with the Myc-pRb-tru-expressing plasmid together with the HA-Nsp9-, HA-Nsp9 (L415A\/C417A)-or HA-Nsp9 (E419K)-expressing plasmids, and Co-IP assays were performed. The similar results were obtained (Fig. 1B) . Our results suggest that the LACAE motif indeed plays a critical role in the interaction between the viral Nsp9 and pRb.\r\n The Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV co-localized with pRb in the cytoplasm To analyze the co-localization of Nsp9 and pRb, MARC-145 cells were co-transfected with pCMV-HA-Nsp9 and pCMV-Myc-pRbtru. The confocal immunofluorescence assays showed that Nsp9 primarily co-localized with pRb-tru in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 2A) , and the endogenous pRb also co-localized with Nsp9 in the cytoplasm of PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells ( \r\n To investigate the effect of pRb on the replication of PRRSV, we first analyzed the effect of the exogenous pRb overexpression on the replication of PRRSV. MARC-145 cells were transduced with the pRb-tru-expressing lentiviruses, and were then infected with the PRRSV JXwn06. The virus titers were assayed. As shown in Fig. 3A , the virus titers in the pRb-tru-overexpressing group significantly reduced at the different time points compared with the control group (po 0.001), indicating that the overexpression of pRb-tru can inhibit the replication of PRRSV in vitro. To further confirm this effect, MARC-145 cells were individually transfected with three different siRNAs specific for the pRb gene. Western blotting analysis showed that the pRb level in MARC-145 cells was effectively down-regulated by these siRNA compared with the cells transfected with the control (siCon) siRNA (Figs. 3B and C). One pair of siRNA (sipRb2) was used for subsequent experiment. The MARC-145 cells silenced with sipRb2 were infected with the virus and the virus titers were measured. The results showed that the virus titers of the sipRb2-silenced group were significantly higher than those of the control (siCon) group (po 0.001 or p o0.01) (Fig. 3D ), indicating that silencing the pRb gene in MARC-145 cells facilitate the viral replication. The above findings suggest that pRb can inhibit the replication of genotype 2 PRRSV.\r\n The change of the pRb abundance in MARC-145 cells was analyzed following the PRRSV infection. MARC-145 cells were infected with the PRRSV, and the cell lysates were subjected to western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 , the pRb abundance in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells reduced significantly from 36 h to 60 h post-infection compared with mock-infected cells, indicating that the PRRSV infection can down-regulate the pRb level in MARC-145 cells.\r\n The Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV could promote the degradation of pRb by ubiquitin proteasome pathway\r\n Several studies have shown that many viral proteins that interact with pRb promoted the pRb degradation by ubiquitin proteasome pathway (Bhardwaj et al., 2012; Kalejta et al., 2003; Kehn et al., 2004; Munakata et al., 2007) . The fact that the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV interacts with pRb and the PRRSV infection reduces the pRb level suggests that Nsp9 likely modulates the pRb level by ubiquitin proteasome pathway. To confirm this finding, MARC-145 cells were transduced with the Nsp9-expressing lentiviruses and the pRb level was examined by western blotting. Compared with the GFP-expressing cells, the pRb level was significantly down-regulated in the Nsp9-expressing cells, whereas it recovered when the cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 5A) , indicating that the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV promotes the degradation of pRb. To consolidate this finding, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with a dose-dependent increasing Nsp9 and dose-constant pRb-tru, and the pRb-tru level was examined by western blotting. The results showed that the pRb-tru level reduced gradually as the Nsp9 level increased, and it recovered in the cells treated with MG132 ( Fig. 5B) , indicating that the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV can down-regulate the pRb abundance by ubiquitin proteasome pathway.\r\n To determine whether Nsp9 promotes the pRb ubiquitination leading to the pRb degradation, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with pCMV-Myc-pRb-tru and pCMV-HA-Nsp9, and meanwhile, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with pCMV-Myc-pRb-tru and pCMV-HA as control. The pRb-tru proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody and were then detected with an anti-ubiquitin mAb. Compared with the control group, a clear highmolecular-weight smear of the pRb-tru proteins was observed in the presence of the expressed Nsp9, showing that Nsp9 can mediate the ubiquitination of pRb-tru (Fig. 5C ).\r\n A number of viruses have been shown to directly or indirectly interact with host cellular proteins to modulate the normal cellular life activities and to facilitate their replications. In this study, we described that the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV interacted with endogenous and exogenous pRb, one of the key cell-cycle regulating proteins. A conserved motifll-cycle regulating proteins. lar proteins to modulate in the Nsp9-overexpressing cells byRNAdependent RNA polymerases (Bhardwaj et al., 2012; Corbeil and Branton, 1994; Munakata et al., 2005 Munakata et al., , 2007 Ran et al., 2013) . We found the presence of a conserved motif-LACAE in the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV by aligning the amino acid sequences of the Nsp9 among 17 representative strains of genotype 2 PRRSV. Our results confirmed that the mutation of the conserved residue (E) at the position 419 in this motif fully impacted the interaction between Nsp9 and pRb, whereas the substitution of the conserved residues (L and C) at the position 415 and 417 did not affect this interaction, suggesting that the third conserved residue (E) of the LACAE motif plays an essential role in sustaining the interaction between the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV and pRb. We found no identical or similar LxCxE motif in the Nsp9 of genotype 1 PRRSV. The pRb has shown interaction with histone deacetylase3 (HDAC3) which lacks the LxCxE-like motif (Dahiya et al., 2000) . Thus, whether the Nsp9 of genotype 1 PRRSV interacts with pRb or it shares other motif that binds to pRb needs to be further explored.\r\n A study on mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) showed that the viral protein production was delayed at the presence of the pRb overexpression (Bhardwaj et al., 2012) . Our results found that the overexpression of exogenous pRb-tru significantly decreased the replication of genotype 2 PRRSV in MARC-145 cells, and silencing the pRb gene obviously increased the viral replication in MARC-145 cells, suggesting that pRb might function as a restriction factor that inhibits the replication of genotype 2 PRRSV. Similar to HCV (Munakata et al., 2007) , our data indicated that the pRb had a reduced level in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, inferring that the decrease of the pRb abundance is likely required for the replication of PRRSV. The pRb has been shown to regulate the cell cycle and the pRb-E2F pathway plays a vital role in cell cycle progression. Previous studies in some RNA viruses have shown that the interaction of viral proteins with pRb could alter the cell cycle progression to create favorable cellular environment that is beneficial for viral replication (Nelson and Tang, 2006; Pietschmann et al., 2001; Scholle et al., 2004) . Thus, we propose that the interaction between the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV and pRb might modulate the pRb-E2F pathway and altered the cell cycle progression which affects the viral replication. Further investigation for this issue will be required.\r\n Viruses can encode some proteins to degrade the restrictive factors of host and to counteract their inhibition activities on viruses by utilizing ubiquitin proteasome pathway. The E6 of human papillomavirus has been shown to degrade the tumor suppressor p53 through ubiquitin proteasome pathway (Freedman and Levine, 1998) . The Vif of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and the Vpx of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) have been indicated to target APOBEC3G and HD domaincontaining protein-1 (SAMHD1) for proteasomal degradation, separately (Ahn et al., 2012; Hrecka et al., 2011; Kobayashi, 2005) . Our results clearly showed that the Nsp9 of PRRSV could promote the degradation of pRb by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Thus, we suggest that the ubiquitinational degradation of pRb might be an important mechanism for the PRRSV Nsp9 to counteract the pRb function. The E3 ubiquitin ligase has been recognized as an important component of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Ciechanover, 1994) . Similar to HCV NS5B and CoV-SARS Nsp15 (Bhardwaj et al., 2012; Munakata et al., 2007) , we observed that pRb altered its distribution and co-localization with Nsp9 of PRRSV in the cytoplasm following PRRSV infection. Thus, we propose a model that Nsp9 recruited pRb to E3 ligases and modulated E3 ligases dependent degradation of pRb by proteasome pathway in the cytoplasm. It needs to be done to clarify the exact mechanism of the pRb degradation.\r\n The pRb interacts with many cellular regulatory proteins and it participates in cell life activities, including the G1\/S transition of cell cycle (Nevins, 1992) , NF-IL6 and IL-8 expression during immune response (Chen et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 2000) and cell apoptosis (Morgenbesser et al., 1994; Tsai et al., 1998) . A further exploration of the mechanisms concerning how the PRRSV Nsp9 affects the pRb function will be necessary to obtain a more detailed understanding of the relationship between viral replication and pRb loss in vitro.\r\n Taken as a whole, our findings are the first to indicate that the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV interacted with pRb, and this interaction promoted the pRb degradation by ubiquitin proteasome pathway in the cytoplasm and benefited viral replication in vitro, providing a novel insight for understanding the roles of Nsp9 in the replication and pathogenesis of PRRSV.\r\n Porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were prepared as previously described ) and maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone Laboratories Inc., South Logan, UT).

Mouse anti-GFP mAb (66002-1-Ig) and rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (50430-2-AP) were purchased from Proteintech (Chicago, IL).\r\n A 1914-nt cDNA fragment of truncated porcine pRb gene (pRbtru) was amplified from PAMs by RT-PCR with the designed primers 1F\/1R (Table 1) according to the porcine pRb gene sequence available in the GenBank database (accession no. XM_001926853.4). The truncated porcine pRb gene was deduced to encode 638 amino acids (aa301-938) with an LxCxE-binding motif. The amplified product was confirmed by sequencing and then subcloned into a lentiviral expression vector pWPXL (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) to generate the pWPXL-pRb-tru-GFP by Pme\/\/Mlu\/sites. The pCMV-Myc-pRb-tru was constructed using pCMV-Myc (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Mountain View, CA) with the primers 2F\/2R (Table 1) by Bgl\/\/\/Not\/sites. The Nsp9 gene of PRRSV JXwn06 was amplified by PCR using the plasmid pWSK-JXwn as template (Zhou et al., 2009) and the primers 3F\/3R and 4F\/4R, respectively (Table 1 ). The amplified fragments were subcloned into pWPXL and pCMV-HA (Clontech Laboratories Inc.) by Pme\/\/Mlu\/ and Bgl\/\/\/Not\/ sites to generate the plasmids pWPXL-Nsp9-GFP and pCMV-HA-Nsp9, respectively.

The pWPXL-Nsp9 (E419K)-GFP and pCMV-Nsp9 (E419K)-HA plasmids were generated by using the primers 6F\/6R with lysine substitution of E419 (Table 1 ). All the constructed plasmids were confirmed by sequencing.\r\n Preparation of Nsp9-, Nsp9 (L415A\/C417A)-, Nsp9 (E419K)-and pRbtru-expressing lentiviruses A lentiviral packaging system including pWPXL (12257), pMD2. G (12259) and psPAX2 (12260) was available from Addgene. The lentivirus-mediated protein expression was performed according to the standard protocol. Briefly, each fragment of Nsp9, Nsp9 (L415A\/C417A), Nsp9 (E419K) and pRb-tru was subcloned into the expression vector pWPXL, respectively. The plasmid pWPXL-Nsp9, pWPXL-Nsp9 (L415A\/C417A), pWPXL-Nsp9 (E419K), pWPXL-pRbtru were mixed with pMD2.G and psPAX2 with appropriate proportion, respectively and were then co-transfected into 80% confluence of HEK 293FT cells using the FuGENE HD Transfection Reagents (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). The cells were incubated at 37 1C. After a number of syncytias appeared, the supernatants containing lentiviruses were harvested and filtered with a 0.45 filter (Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY) and were then concentrated by Amicon ultra-100 centrifuge tubes (Mick Millipore, Billerica, MA). The titers of lentiviruses were measured using a QuickTiter\u2122 Lentivirus Titer Kit (Lentivirus-Associated HIV p24) (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA) and the lentiviruses were stored for use at \u00c0 80 1C. MARC-145 cells were transduced with the lentiviruses in the presence of 8 \u03bcg\/mL polybrene (Sigma). Twenty-four hours after the transduction, the inoculums were removed and the cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS.\r\n For the co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay of the Nsp9 and endogenous pRb, MARC-145 cells were transduced with the lentiviruses that were expressing GFP, Nsp9-GFP, Nsp9 (L415A\/ C417A)-GFP or Nsp9 (E419K)-GFP in the presence of 8 \u03bcg\/ mL polybrene, respectively. The cells were harvested and lysed in precooled Co-IP lysis buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) at 36 h posttransduction. The cell lysates were precipitated with a anti-GFP mAb in conjunction with Protein A Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT) overnight at 4 1C with gentle rotation. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, and were then boiled with 5 \u00c2 SDS loading buffer (Beyotime) for 5 min. The eluted proteins from the beads were subjected to western blotting analysis using an anti-pRb or anti-GFP mAb. To distinguish light chain and GFP, an anti-GFP polyclonal antibody was used.\r\n For the Co-IP assay of the Nsp9 and exogenous pRb-tru, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with pCMV-HA-Nsp9 and pCMV-Myc-pRb-tru, pCMV-HA-Nsp9 (L415A\/C417A) and pCMV-Myc-pRb-tru, pCMV-HA-Nsp9 (E419K) and pCMV-Myc-pRb-tru, pCMV-HA-Nsp9 and empty vector, or empty vector and pCMV-Myc-pRb-tru, respectively, using a Lipofectamine \u2122 LTX and PLUS \u2122 Reagents (Invitrogen). Thirty-six hours after the transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in pre-cooled Co-IP lysis buffer. The lysates of cells were subjected to Co-IP assays according to HA-Tag IP\/Co-IP Application Set instructions (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). The eluted proteins from the beads were subjected to western blotting analysis using an anti-HA or anti-Myc mAb.\r\n For the co-localization analysis of the Nsp9 and exogenous pRb-tru, MARC-145 cells seeded on coverslips in 24-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were co-transfected with pCMV-HA-Nsp9 and pCMV-Myc-pRb-tru using the Lipofectamine\u2122 LTX and PLUS\u2122 Reagents when they were grown to approximately 70% confluence.

Similarly, the MARC-145 cells with silencing pRb gene were infected with the virus as above described. \r\n The siRNA for silencing pRb gene were purchased from Shanghai GenePharma (Shanghai, China). MARC-145 cells were treated with 30 pmol of siRNA using the Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after the treatment, the cell lysates were subjected to western blotting analysis using an anti-pRb antibody. The siRNA target sequences were as follows: sipRb1 (sense), 5 0 -GGACAUGUGAACUUAUAUATT -3 0 ; sipRb2 (sense), 5 0 -GCUCUCAGAUUCACCUUUATT -3 0 ; sipRb3 (sense), 5 0 -CCAGAAGC-CAUUGAAAUCUTT-3 0 ; the control siCon (sense), 5 0 -UUGCGGGUCUAAU-CACCGATT-3 0 .\r\n MARC-145 cells seeded into 6-well culture plates (Corning Inc.) were infected with the PRRSV at MOI of 0.01 in DMEM with 5% FBS. The cells were harvested at 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, and 60 h post-infection. The cell lysates were subjected to western blotting analysis using an anti-pRb antibody. Meanwhile, the lysates of mock-infected cells were served as the control.\r\n For the endogenous pRb degradation assay, the MARC-145 cells seeded into 6-well culture plates were transduced with the lentiviruses that were expressing Nsp9 or GFP in the presence of 8 \u03bcg\/mL polybrene. After 24 h, the inoculums were removed and replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were treated with DMSO or 10 mM MG132 for 12 h.

In recent years, a growing number of studies have paid much attention to the pathogenesis involved by the Nsps of PRRSV. In addition to its polymerase activity, the interaction between Nsp9 and the host cellular proteins that affect viral replication is poorly understood although a recent study revealed that Nsp9 could interact with endogenous annexin A2 in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells (J. . The proteins that bind to pRb have been recognized to share a conserved motif-LxCxE (Dahiya et al., 2000) , which was first identified in the oncoproteins of DNA tumor viruses (Boyer et al., 1996; White and Khalili, 2006; Whyte et al., Some proteins of RNA viruses have been shown to bind to pRb through this motif. In coronavirus, the endoribonuclease Nsp15 could bind to pRb, resulting in the acceleration of cell cycle progression (Bhardwaj et al., 1A , the endogenous pRb could be probed in the cells that were expressing Nsp9-GFP and Nsp9 (L415A\/C417A)-GFP, whereas it could not be examined in the cells that were expressing Nsp9 (E419K)-GFP, indicating that Nsp9 interacts with pRb and the third conserved residue (E) of the LACAE motif plays a crucial role in sustaining the interaction between Nsp9 and pRb. The confocal immunofluorescence assays showed that Nsp9 primarily co-localized with pRb-tru in the cytoplasm ( Fig. MARC-145 cells were transduced with the pRb-tru-expressing lentiviruses, and were then infected with the PRRSV JXwn06. 3A , the virus titers in the pRb-tru-overexpressing group significantly reduced at the different time points compared with the control group (po 0.001), indicating that the overexpression of pRb-tru can inhibit the replication of PRRSV in vitro.

At the end of 2002, the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) emerged in Guandong province, Southeast China, initiating a global epidemic. Approximately 8000 people were infected by the virus, whose severe disease resulted in a 10% mortality rate Rota et al., 2003) . The SARS-CoV epidemic was controlled by the summer of 2003, and the virus has not naturally reemerged since (http:\/\/www.who.int). However, in 2012 a closely related CoV appeared in Saudi Arabia causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) (Zaki et al., 2012) . MERS-CoV induces acute pneumonia similar to that caused by SARS-CoV, and is sometimes accompanied with renal failure (Danielsson and Catchpole, 2012; Zaki et al., 2012) . MERS-CoV is now circulating and spreading throughout the human population, and to date has infected at least 1356 people leading to death in 484 cases. Initial cases were confined to countries of the Arabian Peninsula; however, new extensive infection clusters have been recently reported in other regions such as South Korea (http:\/\/ www.who.int). Furthermore, CoVs similar to those causing SARS, MERS, and many other human and animal diseases have been detected in bat species circulating all over the globe (Annan et al., 2013; Chu et al., 2008; Drexler et al., 2010; Falcon et al., 2011; Muller et al., 2007; Quan et al., 2010) . Bats are now considered the natural host for most CoVs, providing a perfect scenario for recombination events among different viral species leading to the emergence of new viruses, able to cross species barriers and cause devastating illness in other animals and humans . For this reason, development and implementation of broad spectrum treatments and general therapeutic strategies against CoVs are a high priority.\r\n CoVs are enveloped viruses containing the largest positive-sense RNA genomes known, around 30 Kb, which encode the viral replicase and a set of structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane (M), present in the viral envelope, and nucleocapsid (N) located inside the viral particle . The S protein interacts with the cellular receptor to trigger viral entry into the host cell Wong et al., 2004) . The E and M proteins actively Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com\/locate\/yviro participate in viral morphogenesis (de Haan et al., 1999; Lim and Liu, 2001; Nguyen and Hogue, 1997; Ruch and Machamer, 2012) , and the N protein coats the viral genome to form a helicoidal nucleocapsid that remains protected within the viral envelope (Narayanan et al., 2000) . Depending on the CoV species, there are other accessory proteins, some structural, that are also encoded by the genome. SARS-CoV encodes the highest number of accessory genes (3a, 6, 7a 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b), which play diverse roles eventually related to pathogenesis .\r\n To analyze the mechanisms leading to the high virulence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, several mutants affecting their different genes have been generated (Almazan et al., 2013; DeDiego et al., 2007; DeDiego et al., 2014a; Scobey et al., 2013; Yount et al., 2005) . Remarkably, deletion of SARS-CoV E gene produced a virus that was attenuated in at least three different animal models and conferred protection against SARS-CoV challenge (DeDiego et al., 2007 Fett et al., 2013; Lamirande et al., 2008; Netland et al., 2010) . Small deletions in different domains of the E protein caused similarly attenuated viruses, and are promising vaccine candidates (Regla-Nava et al., 2015) . In a similar approach, a MERS-CoV missing the E gene was generated, resulting in a replicationcompetent, propagation-defective virus which may also constitute the basis of a safe attenuated vaccine (Almazan et al., 2013) .\r\n The CoV E gene encodes a small transmembrane protein highly synthesized during infection (Maeda et al., 2001; Nieto-Torres et al., 2011; Raamsman et al., 2000) that mainly localizes to the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi apparatus intermediate compartment (ERGIC), where it facilitates virus production and morphogenesis (Cohen et al., 2011; Corse and Machamer, 2002; Maeda et al., 2001; Nal et al., 2005; Venkatagopalan et al., 2015) . Notably, when the E protein is present, SARS-CoV overstimulates the NF-\u03baB inflammatory pathway (DeDiego et al., 2014b) and, through its PDZ-binding motif, interacts with the cellular protein syntenin, triggering p38 MAPK activation . These signaling cascades result in exacerbated inflammation and immunopathology. The connection between the E protein and virulence has further encouraged the search for other E protein functions that may trigger disease worsening.\r\n One of the most striking functions displayed by the CoV E protein is ion channel (IC) activity. The CoV E protein self assembles in membranes forming pentameric protein-lipid pores that allow ion transport (Pervushin et al., 2009; Torres et al., 2007; Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2004 Wilson et al., , 2006 . Interestingly, lipid head-groups are integral components of the pore and regulate ion conductance and selectivity (Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012 ) . The SARS-CoV E protein showed a mild preference for cations (Na \u00fe , K \u00fe ) over anions (Cl \u00c0 ) when reconstituted in membranes mimicking the charge and composition of those of the ERGIC\/Golgi. In this scenario, the E protein IC showed no selectivity for any particular cation (Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012) , though the relevance and consequences of these IC properties in a cellular context remains unknown.\r\n Alteration of ion, and specially, Ca 2 \u00fe homeostasis in favor of infection has been already demonstrated in several viral systems. To that end a wide range of viruses encode ion conductive proteins similar to E protein, named viroporins (Nieva et al., 2012) . Highly pathogenic RNA viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV), influenza A virus (IAV), picornaviruses and CoVs, encode one or more of these proteins (Nieva et al., 2012) . Viroporins participate in several steps of the life cycle and are usually linked with pathogenesis. Whether IC properties could promote pathways leading to disease worsening has been unknown for a long time. Recently, it was described that point mutations that specifically inhibited SARS-CoV E protein IC activity caused attenuation (Nieto- . Mice infected with E protein IC proficient viruses presented extensive disruption of the pulmonary epithelia and edema accumulation . Edema is the major determinant of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the pathology induced by SARS-CoV, leading to death Hollenhorst et al., 2011; Matthay and Zemans, 2011) . Edema and an IL-1\u03b2 mediated proinflammatory response was increased in the lung parenchyma when E protein IC activity was present .\r\n IL-1\u03b2 is a potent proinflammatory cytokine crucial in resolving infectious processes; however, its overproduction has been correlated with diverse severe inflammatory diseases such as asthma, ARDS, gout, atherosclerosis and Parkinson's (Dinarello, 2009; dos Santos et al., 2012; Martinon et al., 2006; Pugin et al., 1996; Strowig et al., 2012) . Organisms tightly control IL-1\u03b2 production through macromolecular complexes called inflammasomes, which are mainly expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells although other cell types, such as those of the bronchiolar epithelium, synthesize their components (Ichinohe et al., 2010; Triantafilou and Triantafilou, 2014) . One highly studied inflammasome is the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, relevant in the pulmonary tissue. This complex is composed of the sensing protein NLRP3, the adapter component apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC) and the catalytically inactive procaspase-1 (Elliott and Sutterwala, 2015; Latz et al., 2013) . The inflammasome components are synthesized under precise danger stimuli, such as molecular patterns associated to infections. However, a second signal is sequentially needed to induce their assembly, which triggers the inflammasome. This leads to the processing of procaspase-1 into active caspase-1, which cleaves inactive pro-IL-1\u03b2 into its mature form IL-1\u03b2 that is released to the extracellular media to stimulate proinflammation (Elliott and Sutterwala, 2015; Latz et al., 2013) . The presence of ionic imbalances within cells is a main trigger of the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation . Interestingly, several viroporins stimulate this pathway through alteration of cell ion homeostasis, frequently involving Ca 2 \u00fe imbalances (Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012; Triantafilou et al., 2013a; Triantafilou and Triantafilou, 2014) .\r\n There is clear evidence correlating NLRP3 inflammasomes and IL-1\u03b2 driven proinflammatory cascades with worsening of several respiratory diseases, including those caused by viruses (dos Santos et al., 2012; McAuley et al., 2013; Pugin et al., 1996; Triantafilou and Triantafilou, 2014) . However, the specific role that viral proteins with IC activity may play in this process has not been fully determined. Overproduction of IL-1\u03b2 in the airways of the lungs of mice infected with E protein IC proficient SARS-CoVs, strongly suggested that ion conductivity may be stimulating the inflammasome (Nieto- . Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV E protein forms a Ca 2 \u00fe permeable channel in ERGIC\/Golgi membranes. E protein IC activity alters Ca 2 \u00fe homeostasis within cells boosting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which leads to the overproduction of IL-1\u03b2. This data supports that SARS-CoV E protein Ca 2 \u00fe channel activity may play a role in disease, through overstimulation of inflammasomes leading to immunopathology. Pharmacological inhibition of this pathway may constitute the basis for combined therapeutics applicable for SARS-CoV and other viruses.\r\n The SARS-CoV E protein forms Ca 2 \u00fe permeable ion channels Previously, we reported that the SARS-CoV E protein forms channels that are moderately selective for cations in membranes mimicking the ERGIC\/Golgi (Verdia-Baguena et al., , 2012, 2013). Within cells, the movement of different cations through the E protein pore should be dictated by their respective gradients. Ca 2\u00fe possesses the highest asymmetrical distribution between the ER-Golgi lumen (hundred \u03bcM) and the cytoplasm (around 100 nM) (Zhou et al., 2009) , which should allow the flow of this cation through the E protein IC channel if it is permeable. To test whether this is the case, E protein ICs were first reconstituted in artificial neutral lipid membranes in order to exclude any effect coming from the lipid charge, using 100 mM CaCl 2 solutions. Current jumps corresponding to the assembly of channels in the lipid membrane were detected (Fig. 1A) . The most frequent current jump, representing the insertion of a single E protein IC in the lipid membrane, displayed an intensity of 7.272.4 pA.\r\n Interestingly, values multiple of 7.2 pA were also detected, corresponding to the insertion of two (14.4 pA) or three channels (21.6 pA), reinforcing the previous observation ( Fig. 1A and B). Because lipid charge can affect channel conductance (Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012 , single channel conductance was analyzed in ERGIC\/Golgi-like membranes that contained approximately 20% negatively charged lipids. Interestingly, the E protein IC showed a slightly higher unitary current jump of 1174 pA under these conditions, and multiples of this value, evidencing the insertion of additional channels, were also detected (Figs. 1C and D). The presence of the negatively charged lipid head-groups in the channel pore may facilitate Ca 2\u00fe flow through the channel enhancing current intensity under these conditions. This effect was already reported for E protein and monovalent cations (Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012) .\r\n Additional measurements were performed in aqueous solutions with decreasing CaCl 2 concentrations, to approach Ca 2 \u00fe amounts found in the ERGIC\/Golgi lumen. IC conductance (G), which is the ratio between the current intensity and the applied voltage, was calculated. Single channel conductance scaled almost linearly with CaCl 2 concentration in neutral membranes (Fig. 1E ). This reflects that ion conduction inside the E protein IC is similar to the conduction of the solution, which increases as the electrolyte concentration rises. These data indicate that the interaction between the channel and the permeating ions is weak, and are in accordance with E protein forming a neutral pore in these conditions, as previously reported for monovalent cation salts (Verdia-Baguena et al., 2013) . In ERGIC\/ Golgi membranes two different regimes depending on the range of CaCl 2 concentrations were observed. A linear relation between conductance and CaCl 2 concentration was again detected in high concentrated solutions. However, IC conductance in ERGIC\/Golgi membranes was independent of CaCl 2 concentration in low concentration solutions (below 0.2 M), and higher than in neutral membranes (Fig. 1E ). This result suggests that E protein acts as a charged protein-lipid pore in ERGIC\/Golgi membranes. In this scenario, the conductance is regulated by the balance between the ions that flow into the channel to neutralize the excess of negative charges and the bulk electrolyte concentration. Collectively, these data indicate that the E protein forms channels that are highly conductive in CaCl 2 . Furthermore, E protein ICs worked very efficiently when reconstituted in ERGIC\/Golgi membranes under Ca 2 \u00fe concentrations approaching those found in the lumen of the organelles (hundred \u03bcM).\r\n To specifically test E protein selectivity for Ca 2 \u00fe , i.e. the ability of the IC to select Ca 2 \u00fe either by its charge or by its intrinsic properties, reversal potential (Erev) experiments were performed. The rational of these experiments is provided next. ICs were reconstituted in lipid membranes that separated two solutions, one with high and the other with low CaCl 2 concentration. This concentration gradient induces the movement of ions through the channel to equilibrate their asymmetric distribution. The potential applied across the channel, which is required to counteract this ion movement leading to zero electric current is the Erev. The Erev can be transformed into channel permeability for Ca 2 \u00fe (PCa 2 \u00fe ) and Cl \u00c0 (PCl \u00c0 ) by using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (Hodgkin and Katz, 1949) . To test whether lipid charge may have an effect on E protein, selectivity measurements were performed in neutral, ERGIC\/Golgi similar charged membranes, and fully negative-charged membranes. The E protein IC showed PCa 2 \u00fe \/PCl \u00c0 values of 0.2 (1\/5) in neutral membranes. The value of this permeability ratio is barely the same expected for a non-selective neutral pore just reflecting the different diffusivities of Ca 2 \u00fe and Cl \u00c0 . Therefore, E protein channel is equally selective for Cl \u00c0 and Ca 2 \u00fe in neutral membranes. Interestingly, the ratio PCa 2 \u00fe \/PCl \u00c0 increased when the E protein IC was assembled in membranes containing negatively charged lipids, being 0.5 in ERGIC\/ Golgi membranes and 1.8 in negative membranes (Fig. 2) . These data indicated that lipid charge largely influenced the channel preference for Ca 2 \u00fe showing that under conditions mimicking the ERGIC\/Golgi environment, E protein displayed a mild selectivity for Ca 2 \u00fe .\r\n Multivalent ions, such as Ca 2 \u00fe , can modulate ion transport across ICs by interacting with the internal charges of their pores (Alcaraz et al., 2009; Garcia-Gimenez et al., 2012; Queralt-Martin et al., 2011) . Therefore we tested whether E protein ion selectivity could be modified by the presence of a range of small CaCl 2 concentrations. Ion selectivity was measured using a ten-fold concentration gradient of KCl at pH 6 upon symmetrical addition of very small CaCl 2 concentrations (mM range), at both sides of the membrane. By applying the Erev, the flow of K \u00fe and Cl \u00c0 ions Ca 2 \u00fe selectivity of SARS-CoV E protein channel. Permeability ratios PCa 2 \u00fe \/ PCl \u00c0 in neutral DPhPC (magenta column), ERGIC\/Golgi (blue column) or negativelycharged DPhPS membranes (green column). Dotted line represents the permeability ratio value for a hypothetical neutral pore. Values above the line represent cation selectivity, and those below correspond to anion selectivity. Error bars show standard deviations. down their electrochemical potential gradient is prevented. Therefore, Erev measures the relative preference of the channel for K \u00fe cations over Cl \u00c0 anions, but not for Ca 2 \u00fe , because calcium concentrations are the same at both sides of the pore. To analyze the relevance of Ca 2 \u00fe on IC selectivity, this type of experiments were performed in neutral and in negatively-charged membranes (Fig. 3A) . In charged membranes the addition of small amounts of Ca 2 \u00fe induced significant changes in the channel Erev, whereas in neutral membranes the effect was very small, although still measurable. These results indicate that Ca 2 \u00fe interaction with E protein channel, modifying the effective pore charge, mainly occur with the lipid charges that line the pore, rather than with acidic residues of E protein TM domain.\r\n Previously we reported that pH also modulates E protein channel selectivity by protonation and deprotonation of the titratable residues present in the pore (Verdia-Baguena et al., 2013) . The effect of Ca 2 \u00fe and pH on E protein selectivity was simultaneously tested. Erev titration was studied in the presence or absence of 15 mM CaCl 2 under different pH conditions (Fig. 3B) . In negatively-charged lipid membranes, rising pH induced sequential deprotonation of lipid head-groups and E protein glutamic acid residues as their respective pK a (1.73 for lipid head-groups and 4.5 for glutamic acid) were overtaken, conferring an excess of negative charges to the channel and making it cation selective. The addition of Ca 2 \u00fe when E protein is reconstituted in charged membranes reduces the cationic selectivity or increases the anionic selectivity (i.e., it shifts the reversal potential towards less negative values), and reversal potential values become closer to those obtained in neutral membranes. This indicates that Ca 2 \u00fe ions interact with the acidic protein residues and the negative lipid head-groups and decrease the effective negative charge of the E protein pore. This effect was especially patent at physiological values of pH (pH 6-7.5). In addition, this interaction of Ca 2 \u00fe ions with the protein acidic residues shifts their effective pK a towards lower values. These results indicate that both Ca 2 \u00fe and H \u00fe ions change E channel transport properties by modifying the charge of the pore, and further support that Ca 2 \u00fe enters within E protein IC.\r\n In order to assess the biological impact of SARS-CoV E protein with and without Ca 2 \u00fe channel activity, we evaluated previously constructed mutants containing amino acids substitutions known to affect the E protein IC. Previously we demonstrated that mutations N15A and V25F in the transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV E protein abolished ion conductance in KCl and NaCl solutions (Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012) . New conductance measurements were performed in ERGIC\/Golgi membranes in 100 mM CaCl 2 solutions (Fig. 4) . Wildtype E protein transmembrane peptides showed conductance values in the range of 110 pS, whereas no conductance was observed for N15A or V25F mutants, indicating that these mutations also inhibited Ca 2 \u00fe transport, and probably prevent all ion passage as it was previously demonstrated that they also failed to transport K \u00fe , Na \u00fe and Cl \u00c0 (Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012).\r\n Ca 2 \u00fe transport through SARS-CoV E protein channel activates the NLRP3 inflammasome Alteration of cellular ion homeostasis by SARS-CoV E protein IC could have several implications. Previously, we linked E protein IC with IL-1\u03b2 triggered proinflammation in the lungs of mice, leading to epithelial cell damage and death . Higher levels of mature IL-1\u03b2 were detected in the airways of infected animals when E protein IC activity was present, suggesting that ion conductance could stimulate the inflammasome. To determine whether this was the case, the inflammasome complex was reconstituted in Vero E6 cells by transient transfection of its components (NLRP3, ASC and procaspase-1) and the inactive pro-IL-1\u03b2 (Lo et al., 2013) , in the absence or presence of E protein, with or without IC activity. All the components of the inflammasome, besides the different versions of E protein were efficiently expressed within cells (Fig. 5A) . When pro-IL-1\u03b2 was transfected as a control, no significant level of active IL-1\u03b2 was detected in the supernatant. However, when all the components were supplied to the cells, the inflammasome was stimulated, and active IL-1\u03b2 was detected in the media in the range of 600 pg\/ml (Fig. 5B) . Interestingly, the production of IL-1\u03b2 was significantly enhanced in the presence of E protein with IC activity (IC \u00fe ) (4800 pg\/ml). This stimulation was IC activity dependent, as the E protein mutants lacking ion conductance (N15A and V25F), represented in the figure as EIC \u00c0 1 and EIC \u00c0 2 , respectively, did not boost IL-1\u03b2 levels (Fig. 5B ). Stimulation levels found with wildtype E protein were in the range of those previously reported for other inflammasome activating proteins, using this system (Lo et al., 2013) .\r\n Imbalances in Ca 2 \u00fe within cells have been described as an inflammasome inducer (Ito et al., 2012; Murakami et al., 2012; Triantafilou et al., 2013b) . To test the specific contribution of SARS-CoV E protein Ca 2 \u00fe transport to inflammasome activation, the complex was reconstituted in cells in the presence or absence of E protein. Cells were subsequently treated with the cell permeant calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (Fig. 6A ). This compound enters cells and binds Ca 2 \u00fe preventing inflammasome activation (Ito et al., 2012) . Increasing amounts of BAPTA-AM markedly decreased the levels of secreted IL-1\u03b2 in the presence of E protein (Fig. 6A , INFL EIC \u00fe ), reaching levels close to those obtained when the inflammasome was assembled alone (Fig. 6A, INFL) . The Ca 2 \u00fe ionophore ionomycin stimulated active IL-1\u03b2 accumulation in the cell supernatant at levels similar to those seen with E protein, further confirming that Ca 2 \u00fe imbalances boost IL-1\u03b2 production (Fig. 6B) . No significant differences in cell viability were found for any of the treatments (Fig. 6C) . Collectively, these results indicate that SARS-CoV E protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome through its Ca 2 \u00fe transport ability.\r\n Ion conductive proteins are widely distributed among viruses, being especially common in RNA viruses (Nieva et al., 2012) . Conductance of ions facilitate diverse processes of the viral life cycle such as entry, takeover of organelles to serve as platforms for viral replication, protection of viral proteins from acidic cell compartments, and trafficking of nascent virions (Nieva et al., 2012) . In addition, viroporins are often linked to pathogenesis, and in general, mutant viruses lacking them are attenuated, in many cases serving as effective vaccines (DeDiego et al., 2007; Netland et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2009; Whitehead et al., 1999) . Viroporin removal is frequently accompanied by a defect in viral production, which by itself can explain virulence attenuation. However, recent studies have indicated that IC activity may specifically trigger pathways leading to pathology. Previously we demonstrated that SARS-CoVs proficient in E protein IC activity caused increased damage of the pulmonary epithelia and edema accumulation . These disease symptoms correlated with an immunopathological response mediated by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF and IL-1\u03b2, the latter being a crucial mediator of this cascade. IL-1\u03b2 overproduction is linked to a wide range of inflammatory pathologies including those caused by respiratory viruses (dos Santos et al., 2012; McAuley et al., 2013; Pugin et al., 1996; Triantafilou and Triantafilou, 2014) . Here, we report for the first time that CoV E protein formed an IC that transported Ca 2 \u00fe in ERGIC\/Golgi membranes, where this protein locates, which may have important consequences on cell physiology. In fact, Ca 2 \u00fe leakage through E protein IC induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in overproduction of IL-1\u03b2. This finding together with previous in vivo observations indicates that IC activity correlates with proinflammation and pathology.\r\n Generally, viroporins form poorly selective ion channels (Nieva et al., 2012) . Therefore, the subcellular location where viroporins assemble and the conditions of that particular environment are crucial determinants of their impact on cellular ionic homeostasis. Previously, we reported that SARS-CoV E protein showed mild selectivity for cations (Na \u00fe and K \u00fe ) when reconstituted in ERGIC\/ Golgi membranes, mostly conferred by the negative charges of the lipids (Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012 . High concentration gradients are found for Na \u00fe and K \u00fe between the cell interior and the extracellular media (Dubyak, 2004) . However, there is no known asymmetric distribution for either of these ion species between the lumen of ERGIC\/Golgi and the cell cytoplasm (Chandra et al., 1991; Schapiro and Grinstein, 2000) . Accordingly, minimal net transport of Na \u00fe and K \u00fe through E protein pore should be expected, and therefore the biological relevance of these processes may be also limited. In contrast, the ER and Golgi apparatus store high amounts of calcium ions by the action of pumps such as the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 \u00fe ATPase (SERCA) and the secretory pathway Ca 2 \u00fe ATPase (SPCA) (Wuytack et al., 2002) . This creates an enormous gradient of around 1000-fold between the lumen of these organelles and the cytoplasm (Zhou et al., 2009) . The gradient allows controlled eventual and temporal leakages of Ca 2 \u00fe into the cytoplasm that trigger several processes relevant to cell physiology. Interestingly, we have shown above that SARS-CoV E protein IC was also permeable to Ca 2 \u00fe in ERGIC\/Golgi membranes. Furthermore, Ca 2 \u00fe interacted with the negative charges of the protein-lipid pore, modulating its properties. Several other viroporins are known to transport Ca 2 \u00fe , resulting in leakage of this cation from its intracellular stores. Rotavirus NSP4 protein as well as Coxsackievirus, encephalomyocarditis virus, and poliovirus 2B proteins deplete ER and\/or Golgi Ca 2 \u00fe concentrations in favor of viral proliferation (Campanella et al., 2004; Crawford et al., 2012; de Jong et al., 2008) . Alteration of protein trafficking, manipulation of apoptosis, and control of autophagy are some of the processes controlled by these Ca 2 \u00fe effluxes. Whether some of these aspects are influenced in a similar manner during SARS-CoV infection will be explored in future experiments.\r\n Protons (H \u00fe ) are also actively confined to the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and those of the organelles of the secretory pathway in a process that acidifies their interior and creates a gradient with the cytoplasm (Paroutis et al., 2004) . Considering that the E protein IC weakly interacts with circulating ions and that pH can modulate its net charge, it is highly likely that protons will also flow through the IC within cells. This is not an isolated case, as several viroporins such as HCV p7 and IAV M2 are known to transport protons, and others such as the 2B protein of the picornaviridae family transport both H \u00fe and Ca 2 \u00fe (de Jong et al., 2006; Wang et al., 1994; Wozniak et al., 2010) . Alkalinization of the Golgi lumen is crucial to protect acid-sensitive viral progeny and prevent premature activation of viral proteins involved in entry processes (Sakaguchi et al., 1996; Wozniak et al., 2010) . SARS-CoV E protein IC mutants did not show profound growth defects, although they were outgrown in competition assays by IC proficient viruses, which suggests better proliferation when E protein ion conductance was present . Whether alkalization of intracellular compartments by E protein IC may assist in SARS-CoV production remains to be explored. Besides these considerations, it cannot be excluded that IC activity may have a greater impact in SARS-CoV production. Inhibition of E protein IC activity may be compensated by the action of two other viroporins encoded by SARS-CoV, the 3a and 8a (Chen et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2006) ; further experiments are being performed to answer this question.\r\n Disruption of ion homeostasis can have profound deleterious effects for the cells; consequently, they have evolved mechanisms to sense and control these disturbances. Ion imbalances associated with infecting pathogens are recognized by inflammasomes, which are components of the innate immune system. Inflammasomes orchestrate proinflammatory responses to fight viral infections, IL-1\u03b2 being one of the major players (Strowig et al., 2012) . However, increasing evidence indicates that overstimulation of this pathway can lead to undesirable effects for the organism. In fact, immunopathology rather than direct viral destruction of infected cells is the main cause of severe disease in many viral illnesses (McAuley et al., 2013; Meduri et al., 1995; Triantafilou and Triantafilou, 2014) . SARS-CoVs that lack E protein IC activity induced less proinflammation and active IL-1\u03b2, suggesting that IC activity could be a trigger of this pathway . Indeed, wildtype E protein but not its IC \u00c0 mutants boosted the production of mature IL-1\u03b2 through the mediation of a reconstituted inflammasome. Ca 2 \u00fe was the main trigger of this process, as chelation of this ion abolished enhanced IL-1\u03b2 production, and a Ca 2 \u00fe ionophore produced a similar simulation. E proteins from other human respiratory CoVs, such as MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, also display ion channel properties (Surya et al., 2015; Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2006) . Investigating whether these proteins may favor Ca 2 \u00fe transport and activation of the inflammasome represents a relevant issue. Furthermore, the identification of a possible correlation between the extent of inflammasome activation and the disease symptoms caused by these viruses, highly deleterious in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and mild in the case of HCoV-229E, could provide key information on the impact of this pathway on the pathological outcome induced by different CoVs, and will be analyzed in future experiments.\r\n This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing CoV viroporin activity and the consequences of this function in viral pathogenesis. What is more, IL-1\u03b2 overproduction has been related with the pathology induced by SARS-CoV and other respiratory viruses (Triantafilou and Triantafilou, 2014) . Our results suggest that development of specific IC inhibitors and implementation of novel compounds decreasing inflammasome driven immunopathology (Coll et al., 2015) may be a valuable complement to other antiviral approaches for the treatment of these infectious diseases.\r\n The African green monkey kidney-derived Vero E6 cells were kindly provided by Eric Snijder (Medical Center, University of Leiden, The Netherlands). Cells were grown at 37 1C with an atmosphere of 98% humidity and 5% CO 2 , in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, GIBCO) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine (SIGMA), 1% non-essential amino acids (SIGMA) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, BioWhittaker).\r\n Synthetic peptides representing the full-length SARS-CoV E protein, or its transmembrane domain (amino acids 7-38) containing point mutations that inhibited ion channel activity (N15A and V25F), were generated by standard phase synthesis and purified by HPLC, as previously described (Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012) . Ion channels were reconstituted in lipid membranes composed of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPhPC), diphytanoyl phosphatidylserine (DPhPS), or a mixture of 59% dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), 24% dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), and 17% dioleoyl phosphatidylserine (DOPS) (Avanti polar lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL). The membranes separated two chambers filled with electrolytic solutions of CaCl 2 or KCl. Ion channel insertion was achieved by adding 0.5-1 \u03bcl of a 300 \u03bcg\/ml solution of synthetic protein or peptides in a acetonitrile:isopropanol (40:60) buffer to one of the chambers (cis). All measurements were performed at room temperature (237 1 1C).\r\n The single-channel conductance was obtained from current measurements under an applied potential of \u00fe 100 mV in symmetrical salt solutions of 1 M CaCl 2 buffered with 5 mM HEPES at pH 6. The conductance values were evaluated using the Gaussian fit tool of Sigma Plot 10.0 (Systat Software, Inc).\r\n For the selectivity measurements the reversal potential (Erev) was obtained under a ten-fold salt concentration gradient (500 mM \/ 50 mM). One or several channels were inserted into the bilayer causing a net ionic current due to the concentration gradient. Then the ionic current was manually set to zero by adjusting the applied potential. The potential needed to achieve zero current represents the Erev; conversion of Erev into the channel permeability (P \u00fe \/P \u00c0 ) was by done using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation (Hodgkin and Katz, 1949) . The effect of Ca 2 \u00fe on E protein ion selectivity was defined by measuring Erev in a ten-fold KCl concentration gradient (500 mM\/50 mM) buffered with 5 mM HEPES at pH 6, in the presence of increasing concentrations of CaCl 2 . The functional interaction of Ca 2 \u00fe with E protein-lipid pore was evaluated measuring Erev in DPhPC and DPhPS membranes under different pH values, with or without 15 mM CaCl 2 .\r\n Sub-confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells seeded onto 24-well plates were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and a set of plasmids encoding the components of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Lo et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014) : 200 ng of pcDNA4-proIL-1\u03b2, 25 ng of pcDNA4-NLRP3-HA, 20 ng pcDNA4-ASC-mCherry, and 10 ng of pcDNA4-procaspase-1-Myc, with 100 ng of empty pcDNA3, as a control, or 100 ng of either pcDNA3-E, pcDNA3-EN15A or pcDNA3-EV25F. Cell lysates and culture supernatants were collected 24 h after transfection. The secreted active IL-1\u03b2 was measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer's specifications (eBioscience).\r\n Cells were lysed in a buffer containing Tris\/HCl 10 mM, EDTA 1 mM, NaCl 150 mM, IGEPAL 1%, and complete protease inhibitor (Roche) at pH 8. Inflammasome proteins were detected by western blot using a mouse anti-HA antibody (Sigma) to detect NRLP3-HA, mouse anti-mCherry (Abcam) to bind ASC-mCherry, rabbit anti-Myc (Abcam) to label procaspase-1-Myc, and rabbit anti-human IL-1\u03b2 (Cell signaling). SARS-CoV E protein was detected using a polyclonal antiserum produced in rabbits . As a loading control, beta-actin was labeled using a mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam). Bound antibodies were detected using HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and rabbit anti-mouse IgG and the Immobilon Western chemiluminicesce substrate (Millipore), following manufacturer's specifications.\r\n Fresh supplemented DMEM containing the indicated concentration of the cell permeant calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (Life technologies) was added to cells 4 h after transfection of the inflammasome components and incubated 30 min at 37 1C. Then, media was removed and a second treatment with fresh media containing BAPTA-AM was performed. Supernatants were collected 20 h post-BAPTA-AM treatment. Ionomycin (Life technologies) was added at 1 \u03bcM 4 h after transfection and incubated for 20 h.\r\n The MTT colorimetric method was used to measure cell metabolic activity. Cell media of transfected cells was replaced by fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 500 \u03bcg\/ml of MTT. Cells were incubated 2 h at 37 1C. After that, media was removed and a solution containing 0.04 M HCl 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in isopropanol was added. Plates were gently mixed to obtain a homogeneous solution, and optic density was measured at 570 nm.","sha":"40fb39606731326dc761c19c896a74ffbaa74505","publish_time":"2015-11-30","authors":"Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Verdi\u00e1-B\u00e1guena, Carmina; Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o, Jose M.; Regla-Nava, Jose A.; Casta\u00f1o-Rodriguez, Carlos; Fernandez-Delgado, Raul; Torres, Jaume; Aguilella, Vicente M.; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"Virology","doi":"10.1016\/j.virol.2015.08.010","Title":"Virology","H index":162.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause respiratory diseases in humans ranging from common colds to fatal pneumonias Perlman and Netland, 2009) . The SARS-CoV epidemic was controlled by the summer of 2003, and the virus has not naturally reemerged since (http:\/\/www.who.int). MERS-CoV induces acute pneumonia similar to that caused by SARS-CoV, and is sometimes accompanied with renal failure (Danielsson and Catchpole, 2012; Zaki et al., The E and M proteins actively Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com\/locate\/yviro participate in viral morphogenesis (de Haan et al., Remarkably, deletion of SARS-CoV E gene produced a virus that was attenuated in at least three different animal models and conferred protection against SARS-CoV challenge (DeDiego et al., 2011; Corse and Machamer, 2002; Maeda et al., The connection between the E protein and virulence has further encouraged the search for other E protein functions that may trigger disease worsening. Interestingly, lipid head-groups are integral components of the pore and regulate ion conductance and selectivity (Verdia-Baguena et al., This complex is composed of the sensing protein NLRP3, the adapter component apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC) and the catalytically inactive procaspase-1 (Elliott and Sutterwala, 2015; Latz et al., There is clear evidence correlating NLRP3 inflammasomes and IL-1\u03b2 driven proinflammatory cascades with worsening of several respiratory diseases, including those caused by viruses (dos Santos et al., 1996; Triantafilou and Triantafilou, 2014) . However, the specific role that viral proteins with IC activity may play in this process has not been fully determined. Overproduction of IL-1\u03b2 in the airways of the lungs of mice infected with E protein IC proficient SARS-CoVs, strongly suggested that ion conductivity may be stimulating the inflammasome (Nieto- . This data supports that SARS-CoV E protein Ca 2 \u00fe channel activity may play a role in disease, through overstimulation of inflammasomes leading to immunopathology. Pharmacological inhibition of this pathway may constitute the basis for combined therapeutics applicable for SARS-CoV and other viruses. Additional measurements were performed in aqueous solutions with decreasing CaCl 2 concentrations, to approach Ca 2 \u00fe amounts found in the ERGIC\/Golgi lumen. The rational of these experiments is provided next. This concentration gradient induces the movement of ions through the channel to equilibrate their asymmetric distribution. The potential applied across the channel, which is required to counteract this ion movement leading to zero electric current is the Erev. The value of this permeability ratio is barely the same expected for a non-selective neutral pore just reflecting the different diffusivities of Ca 2 \u00fe and Cl \u00c0 . Interestingly, the ratio PCa 2 \u00fe \/PCl \u00c0 increased when the E protein IC was assembled in membranes containing negatively charged lipids, being 0.5 in ERGIC\/ Golgi membranes and 1.8 in negative membranes (Fig. By applying the Erev, the flow of K \u00fe and Cl \u00c0 ions Ca 2 \u00fe selectivity of SARS-CoV E protein channel.

Dotted line represents the permeability ratio value for a hypothetical neutral pore. Values above the line represent cation selectivity, and those below correspond to anion selectivity. down their electrochemical potential gradient is prevented. To analyze the relevance of Ca 2 \u00fe on IC selectivity, this type of experiments were performed in neutral and in negatively-charged membranes (Fig. This indicates that Ca 2 \u00fe ions interact with the acidic protein residues and the negative lipid head-groups and decrease the effective negative charge of the E protein pore. Wildtype E protein transmembrane peptides showed conductance values in the range of 110 pS, whereas no conductance was observed for N15A or V25F mutants, indicating that these mutations also inhibited Ca 2 \u00fe transport, and probably prevent all ion passage as it was previously demonstrated that they also failed to transport K \u00fe , Na \u00fe and Cl \u00c0 (Verdia-Baguena et al., Higher levels of mature IL-1\u03b2 were detected in the airways of infected animals when E protein IC activity was present, suggesting that ion conductance could stimulate the inflammasome. 2013) , in the absence or presence of E protein, with or without IC activity. Interestingly, the production of IL-1\u03b2 was significantly enhanced in the presence of E protein with IC activity (IC \u00fe ) (4800 pg\/ml). This compound enters cells and binds Ca 2 \u00fe preventing inflammasome activation (Ito et al., No significant differences in cell viability were found for any of the treatments (Fig. In addition, viroporins are often linked to pathogenesis, and in general, mutant viruses lacking them are attenuated, in many cases serving as effective vaccines (DeDiego et al., However, recent studies have indicated that IC activity may specifically trigger pathways leading to pathology. In fact, Ca 2 \u00fe leakage through E protein IC induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in overproduction of IL-1\u03b2. This creates an enormous gradient of around 1000-fold between the lumen of these organelles and the cytoplasm (Zhou et al., Interestingly, we have shown above that SARS-CoV E protein IC was also permeable to Ca 2 \u00fe in ERGIC\/Golgi membranes. Considering that the E protein IC weakly interacts with circulating ions and that pH can modulate its net charge, it is highly likely that protons will also flow through the IC within cells. This is not an isolated case, as several viroporins such as HCV p7 and IAV M2 are known to transport protons, and others such as the 2B protein of the picornaviridae family transport both H \u00fe and Ca 2 \u00fe (de Jong et al., Alkalinization of the Golgi lumen is crucial to protect acid-sensitive viral progeny and prevent premature activation of viral proteins involved in entry processes (Sakaguchi et al., 2006) ; further experiments are being performed to answer this question. Disruption of ion homeostasis can have profound deleterious effects for the cells; consequently, they have evolved mechanisms to sense and control these disturbances. The membranes separated two chambers filled with electrolytic solutions of CaCl 2 or KCl. All measurements were performed at room temperature (237 1 1C). The conductance values were evaluated using the Gaussian fit tool of Sigma Plot 10.0 (Systat Software, Inc). Then the ionic current was manually set to zero by adjusting the applied potential. The potential needed to achieve zero current represents the Erev; conversion of Erev into the channel permeability (P \u00fe \/P \u00c0 ) was by done using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation (Hodgkin and Katz, 1949) .

Understanding the molecular basis in relation to the virulence of HP-PRRSV is essential for effectively controlling clinical infection and disease.

The virus remains a threat to pig production since it was first recognized in the early 1990s (Benfield et al., 1992; Wensvoort et al., 1991) . PRRSV is an enveloped virus with a single positive-stranded genomic RNA, which is newly proposed to be classified into the genus Porartevirus of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales, together with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and rat arterivirus 1 (Kuhn et al., 2016 ; https:\/\/talk.ictvonline. org\/ictv-reports\/ictv_online_report\/). PRRSV has two species (PRRSV1 and PRRSV2) (Kuhn et al., 2016) , namely the European type (type 1) and North American type (type 2), based on genetic and antigenic differences (Allende et al., 1999; Mardassi et al., 1994; Meng et al., 1995; Murtaugh et al., 1995; Nelsen et al., 1999) . The PRRSV genome is approximately 15 kb in size, and contains 12 known open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF1a and ORF1b situated in the 5'-proximal three quarters of the genome encode two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which can be processed into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp), including nsp1\u03b1\/\u03b2, nsp2-6, nsp7\u03b1\/\u03b2, nsp8-12, as well as nsp2TF and nsp2N (Fang et al., 2012; Fang and Snijder, 2010; Li et al., 2015; Mardassi et al., 1995; Meulenberg et al., 1995) . The ORF2a, ORF2b, ORFs3-7, and ORF5a encode viral structural proteins (Johnson et al., 2011; Mardassi et al., 1995; Meulenberg et al., 1995; van Nieuwstadt et al., 1996; Wu et al., 2001) . The majority of PRRSV nsps have been shown to play important roles in viral replication, genomic transcription and the modulation of innate immune responses (Fang and Snijder, 2010; Yoo et al., 2010) .\r\n Tremendous molecular epidemiological data have shown that either type 1 or type 2 PRRSV exhibits broad genetic variation and diversified strains (Shi et al., 2010) . The persistent evolution nature of PRRSV has led to the emergence of novel and variant strains with higher pathogenicity or virulence (Han et al., 2006; Karniychuk et al., 2010; Tian et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015) . The Chinese highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) with a unique hallmark of 30-amino acid deletion in the viral nsp2 emerged and prevailed in 2006 (Tian et al., 2007) , causing colossal economic losses to the swine production (Zhou and Yang, 2010) . A number of studies have provided essential evidence for understanding the pathogenesis of the Chinese HP-PRRSV (Han et al., 2017) . HP-PRRSV infection is shown to display expanded tissue tropism and increased virus loads in a variety of organs (Hu et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012) , and cause more severe lung injuries and histopathological changes (Han et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2013) , and thymus atrophy, depletion of thymocytes, and apoptotic cell death of thymic epithelial cells (Guo et al., 2013; He et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014b) . Importantly, much attention has been paid to the molecular basis in relation to its virulence. Our previous study indicated that the 30-amino acid deletion in its nsp2 is not related to the fatal virulence for piglets (Zhou et al., 2009) . Subsequent works clearly revealed that the nsp9 and nsp10 together are closely related to the replication efficiency both in vitro and in vivo, and contribute to the fatal virulence of the Chinese HP-PRRSV (Li et al., 2014c) . However, it remains unclear whether the Chinese HP-PRRSV shares the amino acid sites in nsp9 or\/and nsp10 determining its fatal virulence.\r\n In arterivirus, the nsp9 possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity, and the nsp10 contains metal binding region with RNA helicase activity, which are considered to be assembled into the replication and transcription complex (RTC), and to play a crucial role in virus replication (Beerens et al., 2007; van Dinten et al., 2000) . In terms of the structural model of coronavirus nsp12 (Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Xu et al., 2003) , the nsp9 of PRRSV is predicated to consist of at least two domains, an N-terminal domain with RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) activity and a canonical RdRp occupying its Cterminal domain (Lehmann et al., 2015a) . A conserved SDD motif and Asp residue within the RdRp domain of nsp9 are recognized to be critical for RNA polymerase activity and RNA synthesis (Lehmann et al., 2016; Snijder et al., 1990; Subissi et al., 2014) . The nsp10 of arterivirus belongs to superfamily 1 helicase (HEL1), and its helicase activity domain has similar structure to a cellular helicase Upf1 that participates in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, implying that the nsp10 might also play a role in post-transcriptional quality control of viral RNA (Deng et al., 2014; Lehmann et al., 2015b) . In the present study, we constructed a serial of mutant viruses with the mutated amino acid residues in the nsp9 and nsp10 of PRRSV by using reverse genetic approach, based on the differential amino acid sites in nsp9 and nsp10 between HP-PRRSV and low pathogenic PRRSV (LP-PRRSV), and analyzed the replication efficiency and pathogenicity of mutant viruses for piglets, in an attempt to identify the critical amino acids in relation to the fatal virulence in nsp9 or\/and nsp10 of HP-PRRSV.\r\n The animal experiments in this study were approved by the Laboratory Animal Ethical Committee of China Agricultural University with the license number (CAU20160828-2). All animal experiments were performed according to the Chinese Regulations of Laboratory Animals-The Guidelines for the Care of Laboratory Animals (Ministry of Science and Technology of People's Republic of China) and Laboratory Animal-Requirements of Environment and Housing Facilities (National Laboratory Animal Standardization Technical Committee).\r\n MARC-145 cells (ATCC CRL-12231), a subclone of the African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line, were used for PRRSV propagation. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine sera (FBS) (HyClone Laboratories Inc., South Logan, UT) at 37\u00b0C under a humid 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were prepared as previously described , and used for growth efficiency analysis of the viruses. PAMs were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 U\/ml penicillin, 50 mg\/ml streptomycin, at 37\u00b0C under a humid 5% CO 2 atmosphere. The full-length infectious cDNA clones of HP-PRRSV JXwn06 and the chimeric infectious cDNA clones between JXwn06 and LP-PRRSV HB-1\/3.9 were used in this study, including pWSK-RvJXwn, pWSK-RvJHn10, pWSK-RvJHn9n10, pWSK-RvHJn9n10 and pWSK-RvHJn10, which were constructed previously in our laboratory (Li et al., 2014c; Zhou et al., 2009) . For virus growth efficiency analysis and animal experiments, the rescued viruses (RvJXwn, RvJHn9n10, RvJHn10, RvHB-1\/3.9, RvHJn9n10 and RvHJn10) conserved in our laboratory were utilized in this study (Li et al., 2014c; Zhou et al., 2009 ).\r\n By aligning the amino acid sequences, totally nine different amino acid residues existed in nsp9, including nsp8 that is considered an Nterminal domain of nsp9 (Lunney et al., 2016) , and nsp10 between the HP-PRRSV JXwn06 and LP-PRRSV HB-1\/3.9 with an amino acid deletion in nsp9 that is not counted (Zhou et al., 2009) . Of them, four amino acids located in the position 427, 586, 592 and 609 of nsp9, and five located in the position 11, 51, 69, 296 and 408 of nsp10 (Table 1) . According to the strategies as previously described (Zhou et al., 2009) , respective nucleotide mutation targeting the differential residues in the fragment C (containing nsp9-and nsp10-coding region) of infectious cDNA clones was conducted with the unique restriction enzymes NheI and AscI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The plasmid Pjet1.2\/ blunt (Fisher Scientific) was used to construct the plasmid Pjet1.2-C, which was then inserted the fragment C. Then the target nucleotides were mutated in the plasmid by fast mutagenesis system (TransGen, Beijing, China). The mutant plasmids and the backbones of infectious cDNA clones were digested by the restriction enzymes NheI and AscI, and finally the mutated fragment C was inserted into the backbone to generate the full-length infectious cDNA clone with respective mutated site.\r\n MARC-145 cells were transfected with the mutant full-length cDNA clone by Lipofectamine LTX (Fisher Scientific) and serially passaged for three times in MARC-145 cells. Then the rescued viruses were examined by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using the PRRSV N-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) SDOW17 (Rural Technologies, Brookings, SD). The RNAs of third-passage rescued viruses were extracted, and amplified by RT-PCR, and the amplified fragment was sequenced to further confirm the mutated sites.\r\n Healthy, six-week old, landrace piglets were obtained from Beijing Center for SPF Swine Breeding & Management that is known to be free of PRRSV. All piglets were confirmed to be negative for PRRSV infection by commercial IDEXX ELISA kits and RT-PCR detection in our laboratory. The piglets were raised in the animal facilities at China Agricultural University (CAU).\r\n The piglets were randomly divided into different groups based on the animal experiments design. The animals in each group (n=5) were The list of rescued viruses with mutated respective amino acid sites. Mutations L. Xu et al. Virology 517 (2018) 135-147 separately housed in different isolation rooms. Each piglet in each infection group was administered intranasally with 2 ml of respective virus (RvJXwn, JXwn-T586A, JXwn-S592T, JXwn-T586A\/S592T, JXwn-A427T\/D609G, RvJHn10, JHn10-T586A, JHn10-S592T, JHn10-T586A\/S592T, JHn10-A427T\/D609G, RvHJn10 and HJn10-A586T\/ T592S) of passage 3rd containing 10 5 TCID 50 \/ml. Each piglet in the control group received the same dose of MARC-145 cell culture supernatant. All the survived piglets were euthanized and necropsied on day 21 post-inoculation (dpi). Clinical examinations were performed and recorded daily. The average daily weight gain (ADG) was calculated by weighting the piglets at 7, 14 and 21 dpi, respectively.\r\n Primary PAMs were infected with respective virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. The cell cultures were collected at 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 60 h and 72 h post-infection (pi) and the virus titers were determined using a microtitration infectivity assay, as previously described (Li et al., 2014c) .\r\n Primary PAMs were infected with respective virus at a MOI of 1. The PAMs were collected prior to infection and at 12 h pi, and total RNA was extracted from the cells using TRIZOL Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Fisher Scientific). 200 ng of RNAs were used for further RT-PCR. Real-time PCR was carried out using the SYBRGreen (ABI) on an ABI 7500 Fast Real Time PCR system (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). The primers used for detecting the copy numbers of PRRSV nsp9 gene were designed as previously described (Spear and Faaberg, 2015) . Eight serial dilutions of plasmid with the copy number from 10 1 to 10 8 copies\/\u03bcl served as template to run reaction on the ABI 7500 quantitative PCR machine to generate a standard curve. Cycling parameters used for all the reactions were as follows: 50\u00b0C for 2 min; 95\u00b0C for 2 min; and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 60 s. Data collection was performed during the 60\u00b0C elongation step. The standard curve was automatically generated and the numbers of nsp9 gene copy were calculated with the 7500 System SDS software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).\r\n Microscopic pathological changes and IHC examinations for lung of each piglet were performed as previously described (Halbur et al., , 1996 . Briefly, lung tissue samples were taken, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution at room temperature for 48 h and then processed by conventional histopathological procedures. Two sections for each sample were prepared. One section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for microscopic pathological change examination, and another was stained with the mAb specific for PRRSV N protein (SDOW17) at 1:1000 dilutions for IHC examination of PRRSV antigen. The scores of lung microscopic lesions were blindly evaluated from 0 to 4, which accounted for the distribution and severity of interstitial pneumonia. The IHC scores of PRRSV antigen were conducted through a range score of 0-4 for evaluating the numbers of PRRSVpositive cells.\r\n Serum samples of animals were collected at 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21 dpi to analyze the viral loads in the sera of the inoculated animals using a microtitration infectivity assay.\r\n The significant differences were analyzed using a one-way or twoway RM ANOVA in the GraphPad Prism (version 5.0) software. A nonparametric test was employed to determine the significant difference in microscopic lung lesion scores and immunohistochemistry scores. Differences were considered statistically significant at a p value of \uff1c0.05.\r\n 3.1. The residues in the position 586 and 592 of nsp9 determined the replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV in PAMs\r\n To screen for the potential amino acid sites affecting the replication efficiency of PRRSV, we used the chimeric full-length cDNA clones (pWSK-RvJHn9n10 and pWSK-RvHJn9n10), and constructed a serial of full-length cDNA clones with mutated differential amino acid sites in nsp9 and nsp10 between JXwn06 and HB-1\/3.9. Totally, 18 viruses with a single residue mutation were rescued ( Table 2 ). The replication efficiencies of these mutated viruses in PAMs were examined and compared by drawing growth curves, together with the parental viruses (RvJXwn, RvHB-1\/3.9, RvJHn9n10 and RvHJn9n10). As shown in Fig. 1A , compared with the parental virus RvHB-1\/3.9, the RvHJn9n10 with swapping nsp9-and nsp10-coding regions of JXwn06 had an increased replication efficiency in PAMs. While the HJn9n10-T586A with the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 of nsp9 had lower titers than RvHJn9n10, with significant differences at 36 h and 48 h pi (p\uff1c0.01); the HJn9n10-S592T with the mutation of Ser to Thr in 592 of nsp9 also showed the decreased titers, with a similar level to RvHB-1\/3.9, and its titers were significantly lower than RvHJn9n10 at 36 h (p\uff1c0.01) and 48 h pi (p\uff1c0.05). The viruses with other mutations in nsp9 and nsp10 showed similar growth kinetics to the RvHJn9n10 (Fig. 1B) . On other hand, we measured the growth kinetics of mutant viruses based on RvJHn9n10 with swapping nsp9-and nsp10-coding regions of HB-1\/ 3.9. The results showed that RvJHn9n10 had a decreased replication efficiency than RvJXwn, but the viruses with mutated differential amino acid sites did not exhibit an increased growth efficiency than RvJHn9n10, even the viruses with the mutation of Ala to Thr in 586 and Thr to Ser in 592 of nsp9 (JHn9n10-A586T and JHn9n10-T592S) had slightly decreased titers ( Fig. 1C and D) . Obviously, these data indicate that it is insufficient to increase the replication efficiency of the chimeric PRRSV RvJHn9n10 by mutating only one amino acid.\r\n To further confirm the influence of the two residues (586 and 592 in nsp9) on PRRSV replication, we used the full-length cDNA clone (pWSK-RvJXwn) of JXwn06 and constructed a serial of full-length cDNA clones with mutated differential amino acid sites in nsp9 and rescued the viruses (JXwn-T586A, JXwn-S592T, JXwn-T586A\/S592T, JXwn-A427T\/D609G) (Table 2 ). Meanwhile, considering that the nsp10 of HP-PRRSV also plays a role in its fatal virulence for piglets (Li et al., 2014c) , we used the chimeric full-length infectious cDNA clone pWSK-RvJHn10 as backbone and mutated the corresponding amino acid sites, and rescued the viruses (JHn10-T586A, JHn10-S592T, JHn10-T586A\/ S592T and JHn10-A427T\/D609G) (Table 2) . Firstly, we evaluated the replication efficiency of these mutant viruses and their parental viruses in PAMs. As shown in Fig. 2A , the viruses with the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 or Ser to Thr in 592 or both had lower titers than the parental virus RvJXwn, with significant difference at 24 h pi (p\uff1c0.05), and delayed peak. While the viruses with the mutation of other two residues together showed no change of the replication efficiency. Similar data were obtained in the mutant viruses based on pWSK-RvJHn10. The titers of the viruses with the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 or Ser to Thr in 592 or both decreased and their titer peaks delayed, while the viruses with the mutation of other two residues together had no significant differences in viral titers, compared with RvJHn10 (Fig. 2B) .\r\n Moreover, PAMs were infected with respective virus at a MOI of 1, and the copy numbers of nsp9 gene for the viruses were detected in order to evaluate the RNA synthesis efficiency by real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 2C , the copy numbers of nsp9 gene of all viruses had a similar level at 0 h pi, while at 12 h pi, the average copy numbers of JXwn-T586A, JXwn-S592T and JXwn-T586A\/S592T reached 7.16log10\/\u03bcl, 7.46log10\/\u03bcl, and 6.92log10\/\u03bcl, respectively, which were remarkable lower than that of RvJXwn (7.74log10\/\u03bcl) (p\uff1c0.01 or 0.001), in addition to the JXwn-A427T\/D609G with a similar level to\r\n RvJXwn. The RNA synthesis efficiency of the mutant viruses based on pWSK-RnJHn10 was also measured. The mutant viruses (JHn10-T586A, JHn10-S592T and JHn10-T586A\/S592T), had the nsp9 copy numbers of 7.31log10\/\u03bcl, 7.23log10\/\u03bcl, and 6.95log10\/\u03bcl, respectively, which were significantly lower than that of RvJHn10 (7.75log10\/ul) (p\uff1c 0.001), while the virus JHn10-A427T\/D609G showed no statistically significant differences in nsp9 copy numbers with RvJHn10 (Fig. 2D ). Taken together, the above results indicated that the mutations of the residues 586 and 592 in nsp9 decreased the replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV in PAMs, while the mutations of the residues 427 and 609 in nsp9 did not, suggesting that the residues 586 and 592 in nsp9 contribute to the replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV.\r\n The pathogenicity of the mutant viruses based on pWSK-RvJXwn and pWSK-RvJHn10 for piglets was analyzed. The piglets were inoculated with respective virus, and rectal temperatures of the inoculated piglets were daily recorded. JXwn-A427T\/D609G-infected piglets displayed a similar temperature reaction to RvJXwn-infected piglets which reached the highest temperature (41.5\u00b0C) and maintained above 41\u00b0C from 4 to 12 dpi, while the piglets inoculated with the viruses with the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 and Ser to Thr in 592 of nsp9 or both had a slow rising of body temperature, with the highest temperature of 41.2\u00b0C and short lasting of above 41\u00b0C (Fig. 3A) . JHn10-A427T\/D609G-infected piglets presented a similar temperature reaction to RvJHn10-infected group with the highest temperature (41.3\u00b0C) and hovered above 41\u00b0C from 8 to 14 dpi, while the piglets inoculated with the viruses with the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 and Ser to Thr in 592 of nsp9 or both had a body temperature of less 41\u00b0C (Fig. 3B) .\r\n The ADG of each group in animal trials was calculated. As shown in Fig. 3C , at the first week post-inoculation, the ADG of piglets inoculated with JXwn-T586A, JXwn-S592T, or JXwn-T586A\/S592T was higher than that of RvJXwn-inoculated group, with a significant difference between JXwn-T586A\/S592T-and RvJXwn-inoculated group (p\uff1c 0.01). From 7-14 d pi, the ADG of all the piglets inoculated with the viruses reduced and the loss of ADG in RvJXwn-inoculated group was much larger (p\uff1c0.05) than those in JXwn-T586A-, JXwn-S592T-, and JXwn-T586A\/S592T-inoculated groups. While no significant differences in ADG were recorded between JXwn-A427T\/D609G-and RvJXwn-inoculated groups. The similar data were observed in piglets inoculated with the mutant viruses based on pWSK-RvJHn10. Compared with RvJHn10-inoculated group, the ADG of JHn10-T586A-, JHn10-S592T-and JHn10-T586A\/S592T-inoculated groups was higher, with significant differences in JHn10-T586A\/S592T-inoculated group at 7 (p\uff1c0.01) and 14 dpi (p\uff1c0.05) (Fig. 3D) .\r\n The deaths of the piglets in each group were recorded. As shown in Fig. 3E , compared with RvJXwn-inoculated group with 5\/5 mortality, JXwn-T586A-inoculated piglets began to die at 13 dpi and finally one piglet survived (4\/5 mortality); all the piglets in JXwn-S592T-inoculated group died (5\/5 mortality), but the survival time was prolonged; the survival time of, JXwn-T586A\/S592T-inoculated group was obviously prolonged and at last one piglet survived (4\/5 mortality); JXwn-A427T\/D609G-infected piglets showed no differences with RvJXwn-infected piglets in survival time and mortality. The survival rates of the piglets inoculated with the mutant viruses based on pWSK-RvJHn10 were shown in Fig. 3F . Compared with RvJHn10-infected group (4\/5 mortality), only one piglet in JHn10-T586A-infected group died at 19 dpi (1\/5 mortality); two piglets in JHn10-S592T-infected group died at 14 dpi and 20 dpi (2\/5 mortality), respectively; all piglets in JHn10-T586A\/S592T-infected group survived (0\/5 mortality); while JHn10-A427T\/D609G-infected group showed similar survival time and same mortality (4\/5) with RvJHn10-infected group.\r\n As a whole, the mutation of the residue 586 or 592 and the both in nsp9 of RvJXwn06 or RvJHn10 resulted in the alleviated temperature reaction, increased ADG and decreased mortality of the inoculated pigs, while the mutation of the residue 427 and 609 in nsp9 did not.\r\n The lung microscopic lesions of the inoculated piglets were examined. The lung microscopic lesions of dead piglets post-inoculation and euthanized piglets at the termination of trials were shown in Fig. 4A and B, respectively. All the lungs of dead piglets in the inoculated groups exhibited severe histopathological changes with higher histopathological scores, including large amounts of inflammatory cells and fibrin exudation of the alveolar and bronchioles spaces, necrotic debris and hemorrhage, and the thicken interlobular septal and the destroyed lung structure (Fig. 4A) . The euthanized piglets in JXwn-T586A-and JXwn-T586A\/S592T-inoculated groups displayed moderate histopathological lesions (Fig. 4B) . Compared with RvJHn10-inoculated piglets, the piglets inoculated with the mutant viruses showed the alleviated lung lesions with less inflammatory cells and fibrin exudation, and lower histopathological scores, and the piglets in JHn10-A427T\/ D609G-inoculated group exhibited no differences in lung lesions with RvJHn10-inoculated piglets. No microscopic lesions were observed in the lungs of control piglets which survived until the trial termination. These results showed that the mutation of the residue 586 or both the residue 586 and 592 in nsp9 of RvJXwn06 or RvJHn10 alleviated the lung lesions of the survived pigs.\r\n The virus loads in the sera of inoculated piglets were examined using a microtitration assay. The data showed that the virus titers in sera of piglets infected with JXwn-T586A, JXwn-T586A\/S592T were lower than those of RvJXwn-infected group with significant differences at 3, 5, 10 dpi (p\uff1c0.01, p\uff1c0.001, p\uff1c0.05), and the virus titers in JXwn-S592T-infected group were also slightly lower than those of RvJXwn-infected group, while JXwn-A427T\/D609G-infected group had L. Xu et al. Virology 517 (2018) 135-147 no statistically significant differences in virus loads with RvJXwn-infected group (Fig. 5A) . The virus titers in sera of the piglets infected with JHn10-T586A, JHn10-S592T, and JHn10-T586A\/S592T were lower than those of RvJHn10-infected group with significant differences at some time points, and JHn10-T586A\/S592T-infected piglets had the lowest virus loads, with significant differences at 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 dpi, while JHn10-A427T\/D609G-infected piglets had no differences in virus loads with RvJHn10-infected group (Fig. 5B) . The results indicated that the mutation of the residue 586 or 592 and the both in nsp9 of RvJXwn06 or RvJHn10 led to the declined virus load in the sera of the inoculated pigs. Moreover, PRRSV antigen in lungs of the inoculated piglets was examined by immunohistochemistry. The PRRSV-positive signals were distributed in all the lung section in dead piglets, and the scores of PRRSV antigen in lungs of the piglets inoculated with mutant viruses were lower than their respective parental viruses (Fig. 6A) . For euthanized piglets, the PRRSV-positive signals in lungs of JHn10-T586A-, JHn10-S592T-and JHn10-T586A\/S592T-inoculated piglets were less than those of RvJHn10-inoculated piglets, whereas JHn10-A427T\/ D609G-inoculated piglets showed no differences with RvJHn10-inoculated piglets (Fig. 6B) . No PRRSV-positive signals were observed in lungs of control piglets. Collectively, the above data revealed that the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 and Ser to Thr in 592 of HP-PRRSV nsp9 alleviated the temperature reaction and lung lesions of the infected piglets, and declined the replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV in vivo, and delayed the death time of the infected piglets, and resulted in the decreased mortality of piglets, suggesting that the mutation of these two residues in nsp9 of HP-PRRSV attenuates its virulence for piglets.\r\n 3.3. Mutation of the residues in 586 and 592 in nsp9 of LP-PRRSV did not enhance its pathogenicity for piglets\r\n To address whether the mutation of amino acid sites in 586 and 592 of LP-PRRSV nsp9 enhances its pathogenicity for piglets, we performed the mutation of Ala to Thr in 586 and Thr to Ser in 592 in nsp9 of HB-1\/ 3.9 using another chimeric full-length infectious clone pWSK-RvHJn10 and rescued the mutant virus (Table 2) . Compared with RvHJn10-infected group, the piglets infected with HJn10-A586T\/T592S showed no differences in body temperature reaction, with the highest temperatures of 40.2\u00b0C (Fig. 7A) , ADG (Fig. 7B) , and virus loads in sera (Fig. 7C ). Similar to RvHJn10, HJn10-A586T\/T592S infection induced mild inflammatory reaction with low scores of microscopic lung lesions (Fig. 8A) , and all the piglets survived during the whole period of experiments. Meanwhile the viral titers in sera of HJn10-A586T\/T592Sinoculated piglets were lower and only a fewer PRRSV-positive signals distributed in lung (Fig. 8B) . These results indicated that the mutation of the residue 586 or 592 and the both in nsp9 of RvHJn10 could not impact its pathogenicity for piglets, suggesting that the mutation of the two residues in nsp9 did not enhance the pathogenicity of LP-PRRSV for piglets.\r\n Chinese swine industry has been experiencing the damage of PRRSV for over two decades, and this situation has become even worse since HP-PRRSV emerged in 2006 (Han et al., 2017) . Despite numerous efforts on HP-PRRSV pathogenesis and antiviral immunity investigation for several years, to effectively control the clinical diseases caused by this virus remains a great challenge for the Chinese pig production. As a consequence, it is essential to find out the pathogenesis of HP-PRRSV. In our previous work, we utilized a HP-PRRSV strain JXwn06 and a LP-PRRSV strain HB-1\/3.9 with genetic similarity to HP-PRRSV and swapped different viral coding regions by infectious cDNA clones, and clearly demonstrated that the nsp9 and nsp10 together were related to viral replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV in vivo and in vitro, contributing its fatal virulence for piglets (Li et al., 2014c) . To further dissect the molecular basis of HP-PRRSV virulence, we screened for the critical amino acids in relation to the fatal virulence of HP-PRRSV in nsp9 and nsp10 in the current study.\r\n As well known, many viruses can strengthen their pathogenicity by increasing viral replication efficiency (Brault et al., 2007; Hanley et al., 2002; Watanabe et al., 2009) . Similar findings have been documented on PRRSV. In comparison to LP-PRRSV HB-1\/3.9, HP-PRRSV JXwn06 exhibits stronger replication efficiency in vivo and in vitro (Zhou et al., 2009) . The PRRSV Lena, a strain belonging to the subtype 3 of genotype 1, shares an increased virulence and higher replication efficiency (Karniychuk et al., 2010) . Li et al. analyzed the replication efficiency differences of the chimeric viruses (RvJHn9n10 and RvHJn9n10) generated by swapping nsp9-and nsp10-coding region of LP-PRRSV HB-1\/ 3.9 and HP-PRRSV JXwn06 and determined that the nsp9-and nsp10coding regions together are closely related to the replication efficiency of the Chinese HP-PRRSV in vitro and in vivo (Li et al., 2014c) . Moreover, the changes of replication efficiency were more significant in PAMs than in MARC-145 cells. Thus, we performed the mutation in nsp9 and nsp10 using the chimeric full-length infectious clones of RvJHn9n10 and RvHJn9n10 based on the differential amino acid sites between HP-PRRSV JXwn06 and LP-PRRSV HB-1\/3.9. Considering that PAMs are the target cells of PRRSV, we evaluated the growth kinetics of all the rescued mutant viruses in PAMs instead of MARC-145 cells in the L. Xu et al. Virology 517 (2018) 135-147 present study. Our analyses showed that the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 and Ser to Thr in 592 of RvHJn9n10 nsp9 led to the decreased replication efficiency of the virus, while the mutation of respective amino acid sites of RvJHn9n10 could not result in the increased replication efficiency of the virus. Then we continued to conduct the mutation of these two sites using the infectious cDNA clones of RvJXwn06 or RvJHn10, and confirmed the influences of these two residues mutation for replication efficiency. The data indicated that the respective mutations decreased the replication efficiency and viral RNA synthesis efficiency of the viruses based on RvJXwn and RvJHn10.\r\n These results together suggest that the residues in 586 and 592 of nsp9 are the key sites contributing to the replication efficiency of the Chinese HP-PRRSV, but are insufficient to determine the replication efficiency of PRRSV in general. Animal trials data of serial mutant viruses based on the infectious cDNA clones of RvJXwn and RvJHn10 indicated that the mutation in 586 and 592 of nsp9 could lead to the decreased virulence of the viruses RvJXwn and RvJHn10 for piglets, while the mutation of these two residues in nsp9 based on the chimeric infectious clone of RvHJn10 could not enhance the pathogenicity of the virus RvHJn10 for piglets. In terms of our data, we suggest that the residues in 586 and 592 of nsp9 are critical sites natively conferring the fatal virulence of the Chinese HP-PRRSV for piglets.\r\n Our present study further proved that the replication efficiency of PRRSV is closely related to its pathogenicity or virulence, and the nsp9 can be considered the key replicase directing the replication of PRRSV in host cells and in vivo. To date, the crystal structure of PRRSV nsp9 remains unknown. By using sequence alignments and homology modeling prediction with equine arterivirus (EAV) and coronavirus, the RdRp domain of PRRSV contains at least six canonical conserved motifs (A to F) (Beerens et al., 2007; Poch et al., 1989; te Velthuis, 2014) . By amino acid alignment analysis of nsp9 between HP-PRRSV JXwn06 and LP-PRRSV HB-1\/3.9, it is found that the differential amino acid in 427 is located between motif F and A, while other three differential amino acids is situated in motif E. Our results revealed that the Thr in 586 and Ser in 592 of HP-PRRSV nsp9 are selected to affect its replication efficiency and pathogenicity, but it is difficult to explain how these amino acids impact the feature of nsp9 due to unknown function of these motifs. What makes us more frustrated is that it is difficult to assess the RdRp activity of nsp9 because of its weak and controversial activity in vitro (Lehmann et al., 2016) . Comparative analysis of nsp9 amino acid sequence showed that the amino acid in 586 is a conserved residue in all strains of HP-PRRSV, namely the amino acid in 586 of nsp9 is Thr in HP-PRRSV, whereas Ala in LP-PRRSV. However, the amino acid in 592 is Thr only in HB-1\/3.9 and its wild-type HB-1(sh)\/2002 (Gao et al., 2004) , whereas Ser in other strains. In addition, our animal trails indicated that the amino acid in 586 impacted more obviously the virus pathogenicity than the amino acid in 592. Thus, it is proposed that the amino acid in 586 of nsp9 shares common feature affecting the replication efficiency and pathogenicity of PRRSV, while the effect of the amino acid in 592 on viral replication efficiency and pathogenicity might be strain-specific. Another concern is that, by mutating these two amino acid sites, the virulence of HP-PRRSV JXwn06 could be attenuated, whereas the replication efficiency and pathogenicity of LP-PRRSV HB-1\/3.9 could not be enhanced reversely. These findings imply that other unknown factors may participate in this influence for the pathogenicity of PRRSV although the two amino acids in 586 and 592 of nsp9 are recognized as critical sites conferring the fatal virulence of HP-PRRSV in the current study. One example is that HP-PRRSV can be attenuated by de-optimization of codon pair bias in nsp9-coding region without any amino acid changes (Gao et al., 2015) .\r\n Many host cellular factors have been proved to interact with nsp9 and regulate the replication or RNA synthesis of PRRSV (Dong et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2015) . In another aspect, our results also suggested that the virulence of mutant viruses could be more remarkable decreased by the nsp10 of HB-1\/3.9, although the replication efficiency changes were not observed. Previous studies have demonstrated that some nonstructural proteins of nidovirus can interact with each other, and indicated that the polymerase and helicase can interact with each other in vitro (von Brunn et al., 2007) . We propose that there are two possible mechanisms of affecting virus replication efficiency and pathogenicity by mutating these two amino acids: they might directly affect the normal function of viral RNA amplification, or impact the interaction between nsp9 and host factors or other viral proteins. These are required to be further investigated in the future work.\r\n As a whole, our findings indicate that the amino acids in 586 and 592 of nsp9 contribute to the replication efficiency of the Chinese HP-PRRSV in PAMs, and are critical sites natively in determining its fatal virulence for piglets, providing essential evidence for understanding the molecular basis in relation to the virulence of the Chinese HP-PRRSV for pigs. of Science and Technology (2014CB542700), and the earmarked fund for China Agriculture Research System from the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture (CARS-35).","sha":"8410861c6f772c3e6d5929bad28249aca6c8fcc5","publish_time":"2018-04-30","authors":"Xu, Lei; Zhou, Lei; Sun, Weifeng; Zhang, Pingping; Ge, Xinna; Guo, Xin; Han, Jun; Yang, Hanchun","journal":"Virology","doi":"10.1016\/j.virol.2018.01.018","Title":"Virology","H index":162.0,"transmission_indicator":true,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a devastating pathogen for global swine industry, causes severe reproductive failures in sows and respiratory distress in growing pigs (Albina, 1997; Rossow, 1998) . The persistent evolution nature of PRRSV has led to the emergence of novel and variant strains with higher pathogenicity or virulence (Han et al., 2007) , causing colossal economic losses to the swine production (Zhou and Yang, 2010) . 2012) , and cause more severe lung injuries and histopathological changes (Han et al., Importantly, much attention has been paid to the molecular basis in relation to its virulence. Subsequent works clearly revealed that the nsp9 and nsp10 together are closely related to the replication efficiency both in vitro and in vivo, and contribute to the fatal virulence of the Chinese HP-PRRSV (Li et al., The animal experiments in this study were approved by the Laboratory Animal Ethical Committee of China Agricultural University with the license number (CAU20160828-2). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine sera (FBS) (HyClone Laboratories Inc., South Logan, UT) at 37\u00b0C under a humid 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were prepared as previously described , and used for growth efficiency analysis of the viruses. The plasmid Pjet1.2\/ blunt (Fisher Scientific) was used to construct the plasmid Pjet1.2-C, which was then inserted the fragment C. Then the target nucleotides were mutated in the plasmid by fast mutagenesis system (TransGen, Beijing, China). The piglets were randomly divided into different groups based on the animal experiments design. The animals in each group (n=5) were The list of rescued viruses with mutated respective amino acid sites. Virology 517 (2018) 135-147 separately housed in different isolation rooms. Each piglet in each infection group was administered intranasally with 2 ml of respective virus (RvJXwn, JXwn-T586A, JXwn-S592T, JXwn-T586A\/S592T, JXwn-A427T\/D609G, RvJHn10, JHn10-T586A, JHn10-S592T, JHn10-T586A\/S592T, JHn10-A427T\/D609G, RvHJn10 and HJn10-A586T\/ T592S) of passage 3rd containing 10 5 TCID 50 \/ml. Each piglet in the control group received the same dose of MARC-145 cell culture supernatant. All the survived piglets were euthanized and necropsied on day 21 post-inoculation (dpi). Clinical examinations were performed and recorded daily. Primary PAMs were infected with respective virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. 200 ng of RNAs were used for further RT-PCR. Cycling parameters used for all the reactions were as follows: 50\u00b0C for 2 min; 95\u00b0C for 2 min; and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 60 s. Data collection was performed during the 60\u00b0C elongation step. The standard curve was automatically generated and the numbers of nsp9 gene copy were calculated with the 7500 System SDS software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Briefly, lung tissue samples were taken, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution at room temperature for 48 h and then processed by conventional histopathological procedures. Two sections for each sample were prepared. The IHC scores of PRRSV antigen were conducted through a range score of 0-4 for evaluating the numbers of PRRSVpositive cells. Serum samples of animals were collected at 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21 dpi to analyze the viral loads in the sera of the inoculated animals using a microtitration infectivity assay. The significant differences were analyzed using a one-way or twoway RM ANOVA in the GraphPad Prism (version 5.0) software. Differences were considered statistically significant at a p value of \uff1c0.05. The residues in the position 586 and 592 of nsp9 determined the replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV in PAMs\r\n To screen for the potential amino acid sites affecting the replication efficiency of PRRSV, we used the chimeric full-length cDNA clones (pWSK-RvJHn9n10 and pWSK-RvHJn9n10), and constructed a serial of full-length cDNA clones with mutated differential amino acid sites in nsp9 and nsp10 between JXwn06 and HB-1\/3.9. Similar data were obtained in the mutant viruses based on pWSK-RvJHn10. Moreover, PAMs were infected with respective virus at a MOI of 1, and the copy numbers of nsp9 gene for the viruses were detected in order to evaluate the RNA synthesis efficiency by real-time PCR. The mutant viruses (JHn10-T586A, JHn10-S592T and JHn10-T586A\/S592T), had the nsp9 copy numbers of 7.31log10\/\u03bcl, 7.23log10\/\u03bcl, and 6.95log10\/\u03bcl, respectively, which were significantly lower than that of RvJHn10 (7.75log10\/ul) (p\uff1c 0.001), while the virus JHn10-A427T\/D609G showed no statistically significant differences in nsp9 copy numbers with RvJHn10 (Fig. JHn10-A427T\/D609G-infected piglets presented a similar temperature reaction to RvJHn10-infected group with the highest temperature (41.3\u00b0C) and hovered above 41\u00b0C from 8 to 14 dpi, while the piglets inoculated with the viruses with the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 and Ser to Thr in 592 of nsp9 or both had a body temperature of less 41\u00b0C (Fig. These results showed that the mutation of the residue 586 or both the residue 586 and 592 in nsp9 of RvJXwn06 or RvJHn10 alleviated the lung lesions of the survived pigs.

Higher cortical brain centers will stimulate a catecholamine surge before the actual activity begins. This surge of neural hormones (epinephrine and norepinephrine) acts on the heart. By causing the sinoatrial node to depolarize more rapidly, the impulse for heart muscle contraction will become more frequent. In the highly trained athlete, heart rate may go from a low of 30 to 35 beats per minute to more than 200 beats per minute via catecholamine mediation. This increase in heart rate (and contractile force of the heart) is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system, which signals for the pumping of catecholamines. 20 Whereas sympathetic discharge is increased, there is an inhibition of parasympathetic discharge. The heart begins to free itself of parasympathetic restraints and prepares itself for higher performance.\r\n To understand the heart in exercise, we must view it as the central organ of an exquisitely adaptable vascular system. With the anticipation of exercise, higher cortical stimulation is accompanied by stimulus from other brain centers, such as the diencephalon and vasomotor areas of the medulla. The result of this stimulation is a constriction of resistance and capacitance (arteries and veins) vessels. This mechanism allows blood to flow \"downhill\" to the right atrium. As a result, the more active heart will be adequately supplied by sufficient venous return.\r\n Although the previously mentioned mechanisms may predominate just before exercise begins, other factors come into play during exercise. Contraction of muscles and intensifying neural discharge will increase cardiac output. Muscle contractions serve to \"milk\" veins to increase venous return to the right heart, further priming the heart.\r\n Local vascular changes enhance delivery of oxygen and metabolic substrates to muscles. There are local vasodilator responses mediated by hypoxemia and, in some vessels, enabled by substances such as nitric oxide generated by the vascular endothelium.\r\n The increasing sympathetic discharge that continues into the active phase of exercise serves to redistribute blood throughout the body. Vasoconstriction in the splanchnic organs (liver, spleen) and skin surface shunts\r\n As the central organ of the cardiovascular system, the heart acts as a continuously self-regulating pump. This pump's function is crucial to the supply of blood to every organ of the body. The vessels of the arterial system deliver oxygenated blood with other nutrients throughout the body. Clearing of blood depleted of its oxygen is mediated via the vessels of the venous system.\r\n Of vital importance, especially in sports-related activity, is the heat transport or cooling function of the blood via the blood vessels to maintain a core body temperature within a precise and critical range. It is not far-fetched to consider the skin surface and mucosa of the body as \"radiators.\" Without the blood's cooling function, the athlete's body would likely fail during exercise as enzyme systems and other proteins were denatured or \"cooked\" by undissipated heat.\r\n Finally, the cardiovascular system performs a vital messenger function as it carries important hormones in the blood that act as distant mediators of metabolic processes.\r\n We traditionally have measured the parameters of the heart's pump function by, among others, terms such as stroke volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output, and cardiac index. The following is a short glossary of terminology.\r\n \u25a0 Stroke volume is a measure of the quantity of blood, in cubic centimeters, that is ejected from the ventricles of the heart with each contraction. \u25a0 Ejection fraction is a measure of that quantity of diastolic blood volume that is pumped from the ventricles during systole or contraction. This measure is expressed as a percentage. \u25a0 Cardiac output is a measure, usually in liters per minute, of the volume of blood circulated by the heart. \u25a0 Cardiac index is a measure of the cardiac output divided by the subject's body surface area in square meters. blood volume to exercising muscles. It is in this manner that blood pressure increases and cardiac output can be made to match muscular demands. Local muscle vascular dilations facilitate increased blood delivery to the muscles involved in any particular athletic endeavor. Whether or not there is a true anticipatory phase in a particular situation, as the exercise phase is undertaken a steady state in cardiac output soon develops. There may be small variations and adjustments in preload, afterload, and mean arterial pressure. For a relatively fixed exercise task, a very efficient interplay of peripheral variables appears to adjust delivery of blood to the left ventricle. Stroke volume is not fixed but will vary to accommodate for changes in heart rate. With a slight increase in heart rate or stroke volume, metabolic needs of mild exercise can be met. As the exercise advances beyond moderate, increase in heart rate added to stroke volume increase will supply the fivefold or greater increase in cardiac output required.\r\n Larger stroke volumes are observed in subjects performing supine exercise. In erect exercise, stroke volume increases that measure more than double the resting volumes can be observed.\r\n Several neurogenic adjustment mechanisms that may alter cardiac output originate not only from central neurologic impulses but also from sympathetic afferents from working muscle. These impulses will result in increases in heart rate, contractility, and peripheral vascular tone (Table 6-1) .\r\n In the early phase of exercise, there is an alteration in intravascular volume that allows for flow of plasma from capillaries into the interstices of muscles involved. Lymphatic drainage generally returns plasma back to the intravascular space, and intravascular fluid loss remains at 10% to 45% early on.\r\n It is almost intuitive that as the period of vigorous athletic activity increases, the steady state becomes less \"steady.\" Heart rate tends to increase to compensate for any further drop in intravascular volume and central venous pressure. Stroke volume and arterial pressure continue to fall gradually. The body continues, with heart-rate increase, to try to maintain a constant cardiac output.\r\n As mentioned previously, vasoconstriction in vessels of the skin during exercise serves to shunt blood to working muscles. With prolonged intense activity and generation of heat, the body begins to be less able to dispose of this heat. Thermoregulatory centers in the brain respond by\r\n Preexercise \"anticipatory\" Activation of motor cortex and higher Acceleration of heart rate; increased response areas of brain causes increase in myocardial contractility; vasodilation in sympathetic outflow and reciprocal skeletal and heart muscle (cholinergic inhibition of parasympathetic fibers); vasoconstriction in other areas, activity.\r\n especially skin, gut, spleen, liver, and kidneys (adrenergic fibers); increase in arterial blood pressure \r\n dilating the skin vessels. The \"radiator\" function of the skin performs well but at a certain cost. Blood volume shunted to skin vessels diminishes mean circulatory pressure and central venous pressure. 19 The heart's stroke volume diminishes, and heart rate increases. An unchanging cardiac output under these circumstances supplies skin vessels at the expense of blood flow to working muscles. It is this mechanism that helps to explain the time course of the drift phase and eventual fatigue.\r\n Endurance training seems to make the cardiovascular system more efficient. After prolonged (several months) endurance activity, the athlete's heart becomes slow at rest and during exercise. This bradycardia may become diagnostic and include benign forms of heart block. Athletes who endurance train the leg muscles enjoy a greater bradycardic response than those who do upper body training. There may be a change in autonomic balance emanating from conditioned musculature. After long-term endurance training, intravascular blood volume is higher.\r\n With an increase in oxygen extraction at the muscle level, cardiac output may not need to be so high to maintain a certain level of performance. The acclimatization response also will see that metabolic heat is dissipated efficiently ( Table 6 -2).\r\n With the improvement of oxygen extraction at the cellular level of muscle fibers, exercise of up to 50% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) does not induce a rise in heart rate. It is speculated that increased vagal tone resulting from training explains these observations. If exercise becomes more intense in the aerobically conditioned athlete, sympathetic discharge is relatively reduced.\r\n In the trained athlete, stroke volume is increased. This increase probably occurs as a secondary function of bradycardia (longer filling time). It does not seem that there are primary myocardial charges that increase stroke volume. Stroke volume is a secondary or dependent variable. Whereas ejection fraction may remain constant, maximal cardiac output in the trained athlete will reflect an increase in end-diastolic volume. It is likely that the Frank-Starling mechanism may be operative in maximal exercise. This mechanism is operative as preload (venous return) increases with high-intensity activity.\r\n Diastolic properties of left ventricular function become more important in athletes as they age. We are becoming more aware of concepts such as active and passive filling characteristics of the ventricles. Abnormal diastolic properties of the left ventricle can cause the heart to fail during increasing activity. In the aging heart, it is often the diastolic filling properties that will be altered. An understanding of these alterations is helping us better understand the inexorable decline in cardiac performance observed in aging athletes.\r\n Perhaps because the athlete is considered to be the one who carries the standard of which we all would like to become, his or her sudden unexpected death is a heavy blow to us. Although less dramatic, his or her long-term health and the effect that participation in certain sports could have on the athlete should also be our concern. At the outset, it is imperative that the highest level of importance be rendered to the good of the athlete. As a principal decision maker regarding participation screening, it is vital that pressures that might be brought by team organizations, scholastic or otherwise, be resisted if they place the athlete at risk. 12 A sample cardiac screening questionnaire including questions proposed by the American Heart Association is shown in Figure 6 -1.\r\n Although preexercise cardiovascular screening for sedentary men aged 40 or older has been a general rule, the presentation of acute myocardial infarction, especially in men aged 35 or younger, prompts us to advise taking a detailed cardiovascular history to include suggestive risk factors such as family and smoking history. In this age group, a careful cardiac examination to search for abnormal murmurs and heart sounds should be followed by an electrocardiogram (ECG) and screening stress test. \r\n Should the results of cardiovascular examination, ECG, or stress test prove to be equivocal or abnormal, one should refer the patient to a cardiologist for additional evaluation or exercise prescription. The task for the cardiologist is not totally clear. In some series, most highly trained young athletes have audible murmurs. Furthermore, many of our testing modalities may be too sensitive.\r\n In the young athlete, the cardiovascular abnormalities that threaten health are overwhelmingly congenital; however, many times more middle-aged athletes die each year while exercising because of acquired coronary heart disease. Nevertheless, although in numbers exerciserelated death in the young is rare, we are compelled to do all that we can to identify those at great risk. The task is difficult because we are not certain of the prevalence of certain congenital cardiac abnormalities in the general population. We do not have reliable statistics regarding mortality rates for participating athletes who carry congenital cardiovascular abnormalities.\r\n The revised eligibility recommendations for competitive athletes with cardiovascular abnormalities set forth at the 26th Bethesda Conference held January 6, 1994, are an indispensable guide to screening the competitive athlete. We frequently consider its recommendation when evaluating athletes who may have cardiac abnormalities.\r\n In screening for the presence of significant cardiac abnormalities, care must be taken to establish whether the subject has ever experienced cardiac symptoms.\r\n Although not yet carrying a cardiac diagnosis, he or she may have experienced syncope or chest pain that could represent the first warning of grave events to follow.\r\n Careful questioning about sudden death and cardiac disease in the subject's kin is vital.\r\n The following sections provide a brief review of the most important cardiac abnormalities to consider in a preexercise screening.\r\n Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. With the growth of echocardiography, we have become increasingly aware of this congenital heart muscle disease that Maron confirmed to be a major cause of sudden cardiac death in the young athlete. 15 With echocardiography, we are able to identify those subjects with this disordered heart muscle morphology, although the obstructive nature of this disease had been described during cardiac catherizations before the widespread use of echocardiography.\r\n The primary screening of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can be difficult because the subject may have never complained of suggestive symptoms. Such symptoms could include unexplained chest pain, dizziness, palpitations, frank syncope, or, more frequently, exertional dyspnea. It is probable that he or she never has undergone more than a cursory heart examination. If such an examination had been conducted, the subject might either not have had an audible murmur or had a murmur dismissed as \"functional.\" It is common for HCM to produce a murmur of varying intensity from examination to examination. During screening, a changing murmur should raise the suspicion of HCM.\r\n The gradient developing within the left ventricle in HCM is dynamic and has to do with acceleration of blood through an ever-narrowing left ventricular outflow tract. Certain maneuvers can change the outflow gradient and alter its resultant murmur. By having the subject perform a Valsalva maneuver (straining against a closed glottis or blowing against the thumb placed in the mouth), the systolic outflow murmur's intensity will increase. The increase in systolic murmur loudness results from the reduction of preload on the left ventricle, making its internal diameter smaller, which accelerates the blood being ejected, drawing the mitral valve leaflets into the path of the blood by a Venturi effect ( Fig. 6-2) .\r\n Extensive study of HCM also has elucidated its important diastolic abnormalities. In many subjects, these diastolic abnormalities appear to predominate in symptom generation. Inadequate and slowed diastolic filling is the most important abnormal mechanism to obtain, especially when the subject has tachycardia (Fig. 6-3 ). These diastolic abnormalities may result from the characteristic disordered morphology of myofibrils found on myocardial biopsy specimen. Called myofibrillar disarray, it is considered histologically characteristic of HCM. Of note, although evidence for a left ventricular outflow gradient may be absent in as many as half of subjects with HCM, diastolic abnormalities are common to all sufferers of HCM. It has been postulated that these diastolic abnormalities may further result from a disorder of Have you ever become dizzy or passed out during or after exercise? Have you ever had chest pain during or after exercise? Do you get tired more quickly than your friends do during or after exercise? Have you ever had racing of your heart or skipped beats? Have you had high blood pressure or high cholesterol? Have you ever been told you have a heart murmur? Has any family member or relative died of heart problems or sudden death before the age of 50? Have you had a severe viral infection such as mononucleosis within the last month? Has a physician ever denied or restricted your participation in sports for any heart problems? Have any of your relatives ever had any of the following conditions? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Dilated cardiomyopathy Marfan's syndrome Long QT syndrome Significant heart arrhythmia calcium metabolism in the myocardial cells of the left ventricle and sometimes the right ventricle. Small coronary vessel and conduction abnormalities may contribute to symptom generation in HCM. DNA testing is increasingly being used with some success in screening of subjects suspected of having HCM. Unfortunately, we are learning that HCMs are a whole spectrum of diseases with multiple genetic determinants. There are those who believe that certain other types of testing, such as electrophysiologic testing, may be able to stratify those with HCM according to risk. We someday may be able to screen and prescribe with greater confidence. The more widely followed approach prohibits participation in most competitive sports for those who carry the diagnosis of HCM.\r\n Coronary Artery Disease. A second relatively important cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes is coronary artery disease. In one study by Corrado et al. 6 23% of deaths in young athletes appeared to result from coronary artery disease. Most appeared to have lesions of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. We should be suspicious of coronary artery disease in subjects aged 10 to 29 years. In younger patients, Kawasaki disease, an acquired childhood febrile disorder, may leave coronary lesions in as many as 25% of subjects.\r\n Congenital anomalies of the coronary arteries can cause sudden death in young subjects. Diagnosis of an aberrant coronary artery should be suspected in the subject who complains of anginal pain on exertion or exercise-induced syncope. Patients who present with such symptoms should undergo echocardiographic evaluation of their coronary ostia, thallium or echo stress testing, and coronary angiography, if necessary.\r\n Complaints of chest pain related to position, respiration, or palpation are common in the young athlete and rarely suggest coronary artery disease. They often can be managed with explanation and reassurance. Conversely, exertion-related chest pain, sometimes accompanied by near-syncope or syncope, must be given careful scrutiny.\r\n When considering sudden death from the time of birth, congenital valvular cardiac abnormalities play a large role. The young athlete arriving for screening will have been diagnosed with many of the severe complex malformations that would limit his or her activity. Also because of the subject's symptoms, the diagnosis is less likely to be missed.\r\n When chest pain or syncope are the subject's complaints, there often will be no gross and obvious congenital cardiac abnormality detected, and the possibility of abnormal coronary arteries must be entertained. About 50% of young sufferers of sudden cardiac death will have reported previous prodromal symptoms.\r\n Marfan Syndrome. Marfan syndrome, a congenital disease with the aorta as its most important target organ, has been implicated in the sudden cardiac death of some star athletes. Recently, there has been more awareness of this disorder, especially because it appears to present in tall, slender athletes. There have been high-profile sudden deaths of volleyball players and basketball players who seemed apparently well until their deaths.\r\n Marfan syndrome is believed to be a fibrillin disorder that weakens the walls of the major vessels and may lead to aortic rupture. Some affected subjects may have very long, spidery fingers and lax joints. There apparently are many grades of the clinical expression of this disease. Some subjects might have aortas so dilated that on reaching a certain diameter, prophylactic replacement of the aortic root must be undertaken. This course might be recommended after close regular follow-up evaluation, even if the young subject is asymptomatic ( Fig. 6-4) .\r\n Competitive sports for those with Marfan syndrome are believed to increase the shear stress on the ascending aorta resulting from the augmented hemodynamic shear force that results from increased cardiac contractility during exercise.\r\n Myocarditis, or inflammatory disease of the heart muscle, is a potential cause of sudden death in young athletes and in older athletes. Whereas myocarditis might be implicated in infant deaths, severe pump impairment and arrhythmia generation sometimes strike adult athletes with this disorder. The patient may or may not be aware of a recent bout of gastroenteritis or \"flu\" symptoms. The disease may present with recent dyspnea on exertion. The athlete might complain only of unexplained palpitation or lightheadedness. These latter symptoms might represent potentially dangerous ventricular or atrial arrhythmia. On examination, the findings could be minimal, but a pericardial rub suggesting coexistent pericarditis or a displaced apex heartbeat should prompt the prohibition of exertion. An echocardiogram would reveal reduced ejection fraction and perhaps a pericardial effusion. The most important viral agent responsible for myocarditis is Coxsackie B virus.\r\n Dilated Cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy may be the final result of myocarditis, although there are some cardiomyopathies that may be familial. The diagnosis is relatively straightforward with echocardiography and careful history, although the etiology may be unclear. Systolic left ventricular function may be severely impaired. With exertion, this patient might experience an arrhythmia death.\r\n In some sudden death series, particularly in one representing sudden death in northern Italy, right ventricular dysplasia, a congenital cardiomyopathy, predominates as an etiology. 6 On echocardiography, this patient, who may have a only right bundle branch block pattern on ECG, will have a thinned right ventricular wall. The patient may have syncope and death on exertion. This subject would require extensive electrophysiologic testing, perhaps combined with repeated stress testing to stratify his or her sudden death risk. Increasingly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the preferred diagnostic modality for arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), although this imaging method is relatively expensive and not always widely available.\r\n Commotio cordis is the event after which a young athlete will fall to the ground unconscious after a blow to the precordium. Maron, 14 in a recent study, described the disturbing scenario. A young athlete, perhaps playing sandlot baseball, will sustain a blow to the precordium and collapse immediately or briefly thereafter. Most notable is how little force will appear to have been delivered, but the subject will collapse and die. The subject appears remarkably resistant to resuscitation attempts. It does not appear that the integrity of the chest wall or mediastinal structures are compromised. Instead, it is postulated that a force is transmitted to the heart during its electrically vulnerable period, which apparently triggers a lethal ventricular arrhythmia. 14 Work is ongoing in attempting to protect young athletes from these tragedies by redesigning chest padding and the missiles that the athlete might encounter during sporting events.\r\n Mitral valve prolapse is a rare cause of sudden death in young athletes. Nevertheless, there are some series in sudden death in young adults that implicate this etiology. This malformation of the mitral valve forces the leaflet farther into the left atrium in systole and is more often present in women. It may be symptomatic. 4, 12 It may generate atrial or, more importantly, ventricular arrhythmias that could lead to sudden death. 5 Careful history taking may reveal a family history of this disease. Physical examination may reveal a midsystolic click or a late systolic blowing murmur. Sometimes mild or severe mitral regurgitation will be present. Echocardiography is perhaps the most sensitive test for the establishment of the diagnosis (Fig. 6-5 ). In the subject who wishes to exercise vigorously, stress testing and Holter monitoring is in order. Abstention from stimulants, such as caffeine and tobacco, is recommended. Some patients will become more symptomatic, requiring the use of beta-blocker medications. Good hydration of these patients is an important rule to follow. Perhaps lengthening of the mitral apparatus relative to the left ventricular dimension may worsen mitral valve prolapse. Hydration, increasing intravascular volume and preload, may tighten up on this apparatus and reduce ventricular irritability and any mitral regurgitation.\r\n Other Cardiac Anomalies. Careful history taking and physical examination will screen many of the remaining major anomalies. As with mitral prolapse, congenital aortic valvular disease has not been incriminated as among the important causes of sudden death in the athlete. Congenital aortic valvular disease in the relatively asymptomatic patient will most often be detected by careful auscultation. Although congenital (or acquired) aortic stenosis may be mimicked by coarctation of the aorta, an aortic abnormality will be the rule-out. The subject should be scheduled for an echocardiogram to clarify the issue. Significant aortic regurgitation also may produce a loud systolic murmur and a diastolic \"blow.\" The important issue is that the athlete be screened and scheduled for additional testing to more clearly identify the problem.\r\n The same is true for most other congenital or acquired cardiac abnormalities. Although the examiner may have difficulty deciding whether the systolic murmur heard is aortic stenosis or pulmonic stenosis, he or she will know that the issue deserves additional investigation. An echocardiogram, ECG, and cardiology consultation will be needed before clearing the subject for competitive athletic activity. In congenital aortic stenosis, peak instantaneous Doppler gradients are of value, whereas in acquired aortic stenosis mean gradients are measured. 10 After a careful history is taken and a careful cardiac examination is performed (at rest and after exercise), the need for noninvasive testing may arise if the diagnosis is in doubt. The basic tests should include an ECG, an echocardiogram, and a stress test. Additionally, ambulatory rhythm monitoring (Holter monitoring), chest radiograph, and, in rare cases, coronary angiography or arrhythmia testing in an electrophysiology laboratory may be required.\r\n Although the absolute number of sudden cardiac deaths in young athletes is few, one can only imagine the effect general screening with echocardiography would have on this number. Most epidemiologists and public health authorities agree that general echocardiographic screening of athletes would be a huge expenditure. The hope is that the cost of these studies will come down, and a more general application of cardiac sonography in the screening of athletes could be the positive result.\r\n The resting ECG, although not part of the standard screening examination for the athlete, can be a vital tool. In those athletes who were victims of sudden death, review of any ECGs in their history would have pointed to the need for additional examinations. 15 Most patients with hyperthropic cardiomyopathy could be readily screened by a standard 12-lead ECG. As mass ECG testing would not be cost-effective, reserving these traces for any subject with dizziness, syncope, or chest pain on exertion could reduce sudden athletic death by as much as 50%.\r\n Typically, the ECG of the patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy would show high voltage resulting from characteristic wall thickening. Often, there also are abnormal q waves and t waves. The abnormal q waves and t waves are sometimes referred to as pseudo infarct patterns. Not uncommonly, the ECG might vary considerably.\r\n Other important abnormalities, including those of rhythm disorders, might be detected by the 12-lead ECG. In the athlete complaining of rapid heart action, irregular heartbeat, dizziness, or shortness of breath, an ECG could be diagnostic. Ventricular premature beats can signal more serious sustained ventricular arrhythmias. A short PR interval could warn of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, which sometimes can cause life threatening atrial arrhythmias. Atrioventricular block, from generally benign firstdegree atrioventricular block and Type 1 second-degree (Wenkeback) atrioventricular block to more important second-degree and complete heart block and congenital long QT interval, can be revealed by ECG techniques.\r\n To further investigate ventricular and atrial arrhythmias and their daily frequencies, 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring is useful. The newest models of these devices are very light and can be worn during vigorous athletic activity. We are now able to monitor the athlete with arrhythmias while he or she is performing most sports at high intensity. In the event that the athlete suffers from arrhythmias that require medical therapy, ambulatory monitoring will enable us to monitor the effectiveness of the antiarrhythmic therapy as he or she performs exercise at various intensities to measure effectiveness of arrhythmia suppression.\r\n Cardiac stress testing is used frequently to screen patients in populations in which there is a high incidence of coronary disease, particularly in men aged more than 35 years. Its reliability is greatest in this group when stress ECG is used. Greater sensitivity is afforded by the use of echocardiography and nuclear isotope techniques that attempt to add information about left ventricular wall motion to each test. The subject's tendency to develop arrhythmias with increasing workloads is addressed by an ECG-graded stress test.\r\n The standard ECG stress test can be performed by using any one of several well-known protocols (Bruce, Naughton) or custom protocols that address the particular needs of a testing population. Tests could be modified to most closely reproduce the loads the athlete would encounter when engaging in his or her sport. Information about the subject's fitness or aerobic capacity can be obtained by calculating the subject's double product. This value can be obtained by multiplying the peak systolic blood pressure times peak heart rate.\r\n In preparation for the test, the subject is asked to fast. Before testing, ECG electrodes are attached to the chest. The subject is requested to exercise to exhaustion. Blood pressure and ECG are monitored periodically throughout the test. Currently, some exciting work is being performed with an echocardiographic technique called tissue Doppler imaging. This ultrasound method beams Doppler signal at the heart muscle to measure its relaxation properties. This technique promises to help us discriminate between the appropriately hypertrophied heart of certain athletes and the pathologically thickened ventricular walls of hypertensives and subjects with cardiomyopathies.\r\n The stress test is stopped only if the subject requests to stop or shows dangerous arrhythmias or ECG changes. An inappropriate drop in blood pressure, heart rate, pallor, or diaphoresis may also prompt cessation of the test. When echocardiography or radionuclide studies are part of the test, the images are reviewed to render more information about myocardial perfusion and dynamics.\r\n There are treadmill-based tests and bicycle-ergometer tests. Both techniques have their proponents. Treadmill testing has the advantage of more easily achieving higher peak heart rates, although echocardiographic image acquisition is delayed momentarily. We have not found this to be a problem. Bicycle stress testing has the advantage of image acquisition without delay, but the subject must be coached (and familiar with cycling) to best use this technique and achieve the desired end point.\r\n The use of Doppler wave techniques during echo-stress testing can add useful information and is an interesting investigational tool that helps better elucidate mechanics during exercise.\r\n The use of ultra-high-frequency sound waves to render an ultrasound picture of cardiac structures has become an indispensable tool in the evaluation and screening of the athlete's heart. Without echocardiography, we would still have to rely on invasive or nuclear techniques to screen and measure the heart and major vessels. Echocardiography enjoys the combined unique advantages of sensitivity, technique, safety, repeatability, and portability. A major and ever-growing part of what we know about cardiac morphology and function in the healthy and at-risk athlete is because of echocardiography and Doppler echocardiography.\r\n In the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Marfan syndrome, right ventricular dysplasia, mitral valve prolapse, congenital abnormalities of the heart valves and great vessels, myocarditis, and pericarditis, echocardiography is an essential diagnostic tool. We also are able to evaluate wall thickness, systolic thickening, diastolic properties, and changes in these parameters over time and how these vary with type and intensity of sport in the training athlete.\r\n Hemodynamics are evaluated by Doppler techniques that project a beam of ultra-high-frequency sound waves into flowing blood. Erythrocytes act as Doppler beam reflectors that inform us of the direction and speed of the blood flow being interrogated. With these methods, we can readily determine whether there is a dynamic intraventricular or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in the subject being screened. Doppler echocardiography also is useful in noninvasively determining cardiac output in varying loading conditions during exercise. With this testing modality we can detect and evaluate intracardiac shunts and stenosis and regurgitation of any of the cardiac valves. Despite the powerful noninvasive techniques we now can use readily, sometimes more invasive techniques are the tests of last resort to be used in evaluating cardiac abnormalities in the athlete, from the \"semiinvasive\" modality called transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to the clearly invasive cardiac catherization and electrophysiologic studies. With TEE, complex congenital abnormalities, aberrant coronary arteries, and cardiac and aortic trauma are evaluated. In catherization tests, coronary arteries and assessing conduction velocities in the heart clarify causes of supraventricular arrhythmias and heart block. Ventricular stimulation techniques attempt to induce potentially lethal sustained ventricular arrhythmias in a controlled setting. These tests appear to be useful in stratifying athletes with ventricular arrhythmias as high or low risk for life threatening cardiac events.\r\n We generally have categorized exercise into the large general groups of static and dynamic. As Mitchell has described, 16 static exercise includes athletic activity that involves a large mass of muscle with little movement through space of bones and joints. Dynamic exercise produces movement of joints and changing muscle lengths, often performed rhythmically.\r\n Many studies have elucidated the hemodynamic changes that occur during each type of exercise. Dynamic exercise increases cardiac output and oxygen consumption without greatly increasing systolic and mean arterial blood pressure. Total peripheral resistance is reduced. Static exercise increases systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure while heart rate and cardiac output remain unchanged. Oxygen consumption is increased only mildly. Clinically, jogging would be considered dynamic, whereas isometric weight exercises would be considered static because static exercise places a pressure load on the heart; the walls of the heart thicken, whereas the chamber dimension does not significantly increase. Echocardiography assessments of these hearts are characteristic.\r\n As dynamic exercise generates a volume load on the heart, the ventricular chamber will enlarge without dramatic wall thickening or hypertrophy. Nature's correlates of these circumstances yield a concentrically hypertrophied left ventricular wall in pressure-load lesions. An obvious example would be the left ventricular hypertrophy of severe aortic stenosis. Where the volume to be ejected by the heart increases (as in mitral regurgitation), the left ventricular chamber becomes enlarged with proportionately little wall thickening. As opposed to the pressure-loaded heart that has concentric hypertrophy, the volume-loaded heart with eccentric hypertrophy is associated with a high maximal oxygen uptake during exercise. If we consider the determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption, we can understand how exercise can increase it. Heart rate, myocardial wall tension, and contractility are these determinants. The product of these three determinants yields maximal oxygen consumption in exercise.\r\n Certain cardiac abnormalities cannot safely sustain the load that certain sport-related activities can place on the heart. Certain sports such as cycling share a high dynamic and static character. Other sports may involve a mostly static sports load on the heart. All the high-static sports should be contraindicated for the subject with heart abnormalities intolerant of static loads.\r\n In subjects with some degree of aortic stenosis, for example, dynamic exercise would be contraindicated. Such exercise depends on an increase in heart rate to maintain cardiac output. An increase in heart rate increases the gradient across the stenotic valve, thus unacceptably increasing myocardial oxygen demand and decreasing perfusion of the brain and other vital organs.\r\n In subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, competitive high-intensity athletics generally are to be prohibited. As there is a very large gray zone in the disease, especially where the left ventricular thicknesses may not be dramatically increased, a very exhaustive history (including family history), physical examination, and \r\n noninvasive (and perhaps even invasive) work-up is required. Presently, we do not have a fool-proof method of stratification of risk in these patients.\r\n Athletes with Marfan syndrome often present the dual problems of aortic regurgitation, which requires prescription of exercise according to severity, and dilated aorta. The potential for aortic dissection is real. Static exercise and any exercise that would increase myocardial contractility may pose increased risk to the athlete.\r\n Because the primary care physician may be called on to generally screen athletes before sport participation, an understanding of the principles governing cardiac clearance is essential. Final patient-by-patient recommendations should be undertaken only after an in-depth history, physical examination, and noninvasive evaluation in consultation with a cardiologist.\r\n We are well aware that regular exercise benefits all levels of fitness; there also is evidence to suggest regular exercise may help reduce coronary death. Regular aerobic exercise has been labeled cardioprotective. Bassler once postulated that marathon runners who completed a full marathon were granted a certain immunity to coronary death, 1 but this claim has been disputed. Nevertheless, regular vigorous exercise appears to raise the favorable component of serum cholesterol, called HDL-C. 11 Perhaps, through increased insulin sensitivity in tissues, lipase activity and HDL-C levels increase.\r\n More recently, direct rheologic effects of accelerated blood flow in coronary arteries have been studied. There is an enhanced efficiency of the natural arterial dilating system mediated by nitric oxide that results from vigorous exercise. Finally, the development of rich collateral arterial coronary networks seems to be the result of graded regular exercise when performed by patients with known symptomatic coronary artery disease.\r\n Exercise in the athlete, whether amateur, scholastic, or professional, is beneficial to the cardiovascular system. It increases fitness and quality of life and perhaps promotes cardioprotective mechanisms. 17\r\n As the heart is the pump of the vascular system, the respiratory system is responsible for the delivery of oxygen contained in the air to the blood and the removal of waste products such as carbon dioxide back to the air. Any medical condition that alters this delivery will either increase or decrease the ability of exercising muscles and the athlete to perform. Changes in the oxygen and carbon dioxide content of the air and changes in the intraerythrocytic concentration of 2,3-biphosphoglyceric acid (2,3-BPG) will cause shifts in the oxygen dissociation curve.\r\n The respiratory system includes the lungs, the central nervous system, the chest wall, and pulmonary circulation. When needed, this system can increase ventilation by more than 12 times its baseline. Therefore, exercise is usually not limited by pulmonary factors in normal healthy athletes.\r\n Dyspnea is defined as an abnormally uncomfortable awareness of breathing. Normally, our pattern of breathing is controlled by mechanisms that can vary ventilation to meet the demands of physical exertion. In addition, emotional states such as anxiety and fear can cause a change in normal ventilatory patterns. When evaluating the degree of dyspnea in a patient, one must take into consideration factors such as the overall level of fitness of the subject and the individual's perception of how bad the shortness of breath is.\r\n Dyspnea may be related directly to the amount of physical exertion or may be sudden and related to specific underlying conditions, such as pulmonary embolism, spontaneous pneumothorax, or anxiety. In any athlete with dyspnea, it is important to look thoroughly for the cause.\r\n Orthopnea is defined as dyspnea on assuming the supine posture. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea is defined as attacks of dyspnea that usually occur at night and awaken the patient from sleep. It also is known as cardiac asthma. Tripopnea describes dyspnea only in the left or right lateral decubitus position, which usually occurs in patients with congestive heart failure. Platypnea describes dyspnea that only occurs in the upright position, specifically in situations where the abdominal viscera has no diaphragmatic support because of herniation when the individual stands. Platypnea would be managed with an abdominal binder or surgical repair.\r\n The actual mechanism of dyspnea is unknown, and the differential diagnosis of dyspnea is included in the box, Causes of Dyspnea.\r\n Arterial hypoxia is a fall in the oxygen content in the arterial blood, noted as a fall in the partial pressure of oxygen or the PaCO 2 .\r\n Cyanosis is a dark bluish or purplish coloration of the skin and mucous membrane resulting from deficient oxygenation of the blood in the lungs or from an abnormally great reduction of the blood in its passage through the capillaries. It appears when the reduced hemoglobin in the minute blood vessels is 5 mg or more per 100 mL. A false cyanosis can be caused by the presence of an abnormal pigment such as methemoglobin (carbon monoxide poisoning). It usually is most marked in the lips, nail beds, ears, and malar eminences.\r\n When hypoxia occurs as a result of a respiratory problem, the PaCO 2 level usually rises and displaces the oxygen dissociation curve to the right, which allows the percentage saturation of the hemoglobin in the arterial blood at a given level of alveolar oxygen tension (PaO 2 ) to decline. Thus, arterial hypoxia and cyanosis are likely to be more marked in proportion to the degree of depression of PaO 2 when such depression results from pulmonary disease.\r\n Clubbing is the broadening and thickening of the ends of the fingers. Although in some patients, the cause may be unknown, it may be inherited or seen with a variety of diseases. The mechanism of clubbing is unclear, but it appears to be secondary to humoral substance, which caused dilatation of the vessels of the fingertip. As part of the physical examination, the presence of clubbing should elicit a differential diagnosis. See the box, Causes of Clubbing.\r\n Clubbing in patients with primary and metastatic lung cancer, mesothelioma, bronchiectasis, and hepatic cirrhosis may be associated with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is the subperiosteal formation of new bone in the distal diaphyses of the long bones of the extremities, which causes pain and symmetric arthritis-like changes in the shoulders, knees, ankles, wrists, and elbows. It may be confirmed by radiography.\r\n Coughing is a form of violent exhalation by which irritant particles in the airways can be expelled. Stimulation of the cough reflexes results in the glottis being kept closed until a high expiratory pressure has built up, which suddenly is released. The causes are listed in the box, Causes of Cough.\r\n Chest pain or tightness is a common sign of many diseases and is important in the diagnosis of pulmonary-related disorders. See the box, Common Causes of Chest Pain.\r\n Ventilation is the process of exchange of air in the lungs with atmospheric air, which has higher oxygen and lower carbon dioxide contents. Measurement of ventilatory function includes total lung capacity (TLC), which is the volume of gas contained within the lungs after a maximal expiration, and residual volume (RV ), which is the volume of gas remaining within the lungs at the end of a maximal expiration. Vital capacity ( VC) is the volume \r\n Primary lung carcinoma Metastatic lung carcinoma Bronchiectasis Lung abscess Cystic fibrosis Mesothelioma Regional enteritis Ulcerative colitis Cirrhosis \u25b2 of gas that is exhaled from the lungs when going from the TLC to the RV (Fig. 6-7) . Minute ventilation is the tidal volume \u00d7 frequency of respiration. A typical example might be a tidal volume of 500 with a respiratory rate of 12, which would equal 6000 ml air\/minute. Healthy patients are able to augment their minute ventilation (VE) to exercise loads in large part as a response to increased carbon dioxide production (VCO 2 ). In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the PCO 2 has been up chronically, so it is no longer the driving force behind increased ventilation. O 2 becomes this motivation. Therefore, if we place these individuals on higher concentrations of O 2 (greater than about 2 liters per minute via nasal cannula), they will lose their drive to ventilate and slow down respirations until they go into respiratory failure.\r\n Circulatory function depends on cardiac output and pulmonary vascular resistance. The peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) typically is obtained in an intensive care unit using a flow-directed pulmonary arterial catheter (Swan-Ganz). The normal value for PVR is approximately 50 to 150 dyn.s\/cm 5 .\r\n A healthy individual at rest inspires 12 to 16 times per minute, each breath having a TV of approximately 500 ml. A portion of each breath (about 30%) never reaches the alveoli; this portion is known as the dead space.\r\n The most commonly used measures of gas exchange are the partial pressures of O 2 and CO 2 in the arterial blood (PaO 2 and PaCO 2 ). The alveolar-arterial O 2 difference (PAO 2 -PaO 2 ), or the A-a gradient, is a useful calculation. The alveolar and, hence, arterial PO 2 can be expected to change depending on the level of alveolar ventilation, reflected by the arterial PCO 2 .\r\n Pulse oximetry is a recent practical development in respiratory care which allows continuous monitoring of the patient's state of oxygenation. It is more practical than arterial puncture, which is required to measure the PaCO 2 . Using a probe clipped to a patient's finger, it measures the absorption of wavelengths of light by hemoglobin in arterial blood. Because of differential absorption of the two wavelengths of light by oxygenated and nonoxygenated hemoglobin, the percentage of \r\n Asthma Exercise-induced asthma Infection Chest wall injuries Referred pain from the thoracic spine Cardiac ischemia Carcinoma Interstitial lung disease Herpes zoster (shingles) \u25b2 hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen can be displayed instantaneously. Radiologic testing and other diagnostic procedures have become more state-of-the-art and include many modalities. See the box, Radiologic and Diagnostic Procedures Available. In all patients, a simple history and physical examination is important to make a diagnosis. A simple posteroanterior chest radiograph may suffice as an inexpensive diagnostic procedure. The examiner should always review the films him-or herself because the examiner has the best knowledge of the clinical state of his or her patient. Portable films are a necessary evil in some situations but never as reliable in quality.\r\n Computed tomography (CT) has added amazing clarity to studies, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is superior to differentiating pulmonary vessels versus lymph nodes. However, the added cost of these procedures must be considered. Lung scans are important in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolisms.\r\n There are three groups of individuals who experience asthma-like symptoms after exercise.\r\n 1. Athletes with chronic asthma, 90% of whom will experience symptoms after exercise. 2. Athletes with allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis who have a positive exercise challenge. 3. Athletes who do not have underlying allergies or asthma and only experience symptoms of asthma after exercise.\r\n Asthma is an obstructive disease of airways that is characterized by increased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree resulting from a variety of stimuli. The airways narrow by contraction of their smooth muscle, by a swelling of the mucous membrane, and by edema of the bronchial wall and an increase in the production of mucus. Recurrent attacks of difficult breathing, particularly on exhalation caused by an increased resistance to airflow through the respiratory bronchioles, are typical of the disease. Status asthmaticus is the persistence of severe airway obstruction for days or weeks. Asthma may be induced by exercise. Sports vary in their tendency to induce asthma, with running having the highest tendency, cycling a moderate tendency, and gymnastics and swimming a low tendency. Paradoxically, many sufferers gain relief from their bronchospasm by regular exercise, and exercise is not seen as negative in the management of asthma. Many drugs help to control asthma, but team physicians must be aware that some are on the International Olympic Committee list of banned substances.\r\n The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease estimates that 41 million Americans have asthma and allergies. Asthma is said to be found in 4% to 5% of the general population in the United States. Half of the cases occur in patients before age 10 years, and another one third in those before age 40 years. In children, there is a 2:1 male preponderance, which equalizes by age 30 years.\r\n Allergy is a state of altered reactivity in the host that results from interaction between antigen and antibody. An antigen is an agent that stimulates the production of an antibody. An allergen is defined as an antigen that has been shown to initiate an allergic response. The antibody classically associated with allergy is the IgE immunoglobulin. After inhalation of an allergen, it penetrates the respiratory epithelium and combines with pairs of IgE molecules attached to underlying mast cells, thus signaling release of mediators that initiate an inflammatory response. Individuals who readily make IgE antibody are prone to allergic reactions of the respiratory tract.\r\n Allergic asthma often is associated with a family history of allergic diseases, such as rhinitis, urticaria, and eczema. These individuals will have positive skin reactions to intradermal injections of allergens and a positive response to the inhalation of the antigen. As many as 40% of patients with allergic rhinitis will have asthma.\r\n Idiosyncratic asthma refers to those individuals without a history of allergy, negative skin testing results, and normal levels of IgE.\r\n Environmental and occupational factors may be potent bronchial irritants, such as ozone and the oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. Metal salts, wood and vegetable dusts, pharmaceutical chemicals and plastics, biologic enzymes, and animal and insect dusts can cause problems. The house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) or fungal spores (e.g., Aspergillus fumigatus) can cause bronchial hyperactivity. Fumes from paint and household cleaners may precipitate an acute attack of asthma, as may some perfumes. A drop in temperature at night can trigger asthma and may be prevented by heating the bedroom at night.\r\n Pulmonary imaging \u25a0 Chest radiographs \u25a0 Portable chest radiographs \u25a0 Computed tomography \u25a0 Magnetic resonance imaging \u25a0 Ultrasound \u25a0 Ventilation\/perfusion (V\/Q) lung scan \u25a0 Interventional (computed tomography-guided biopsy) Diagnostic procedures \u25a0 Skin tests (ppd, candida, RAST, etc.) \u25a0 Bronchoscopy\/biopsy\r\n Obesity is on the rise in the United States. The rise in obesity has been most in middle-aged women, in whom the prevalence has increased by 65%. Most notably, the prevalence of asthma among middle-aged women has increased by 80% of the past 2 decades. This data suggests a potential link between obesity and asthma. 9, 13 The most common stimulus for an asthmatic attack is a respiratory infection. Exercise and emotional stress also can be stimuli.\r\n The symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and wheezing are the hallmarks of asthma. One must be careful to differentiate asthma (see boxes on cough and dyspnea).\r\n Every new patient with asthma should be examined. See the box, Asthma Medical History. The diagnosis is made by demonstrating reversible airway obstruction, which is defined as a 15% or more increase in FEV1 after two puffs of a beta-adrenergic agonist. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the course of the illness and the effectiveness of therapy can be followed by measuring the peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) or the FEV1.\r\n Therapy should be aimed at elimination of the cause of the attack. Adrenergic stimulants include epinephrine and isoproterenol, which are not beta-2 selective and have considerable side effects (palpitations and tremulousness). They are effective only as an inhalation or parentally. The usual dose is 0.3 cc of a 1:1000 solution administered subcutaneously.\r\n The most commonly used inhalers are metaproterenol (Alupent, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Ridgefield, CT), albuterol (Proventil, Schering Corporation, Kenilworth, NJ), salbutamol (Ventolin, Allen & Hanburys, Research Triangle Park, NC), and salmeterol (Serevent, Allen & Hanburys, Research Triangle Park, NC). With the exception of metaproternol, these inhalers are highly selective for the respiratory tract and virtually devoid of significant cardiac effects except in high doses. The major side effect is jitteriness because of the stimulation of the beta receptors on skeletal muscles. They also may cause headaches and insomnia.\r\n Inhalation is the preferred route because fewer side effects occur. The dose is up to two puffs every 4 hours while awake. Oral forms also are available; however, the International Olympic Committee has approved only inhaled albuterol, terbutaline, metaproterenol, and bitolterol. There is some debate whether these drugs improve performance in athletes without bronchospasm.\r\n Methylxanthines (theophyllines) are medium-potency bronchodilators and are best used in maintenance therapy. Their dose has to be reduced in elderly patients. The most common side effects are nervousness, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and headache. Because of a need for blood level monitoring, they have been less popular recently.\r\n Glucocorticoids are not bronchodilators and have most benefit in patients with acute illness with severe airway obstruction that is not resolving. The usual dose is 6 mg\/kg\/day of hydrocortisone, and higher doses do not improve patients' symptoms.\r\n Inhaled glucocorticoids are sometimes combined with beta-adrenergic agonist inhalers. The most popular of these is Advair, a combination of Serevent (salmeterol) and Flovent (fluticasone). This product is best used in those athletes who have chronic lung disease and use the medication on a chronic, not emergent or episodic, basis. Although albuterol will work immediately, Serevent (salmeterol) will take 20 minutes to take effect and therefore is not for use in emergent asthmatic attacks, rather for long-term treatment. This inhaler can be left at home as it is only used twice a day. The Alupent is what should be carried along for episodic asthmatic attacks. Combivent is a combination of atrovent (ipratropium bromide) and albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol (Boehringer Ingelheim).\r\n Mast cell stabilizing agents, cromolyn sodium (Intal) and nedocromil sodium (Tilade), are not bronchodilators. They inhibit degranulation of mast cells, preventing the release of the chemical mediators of anaphylaxis. They are most useful in atopic patients. A therapeutic trial of two puffs daily for 4 to 6 weeks frequently is necessary. Nedocromil may cause an unpleasant bitter taste about 10 to 15 minutes after inhalation.\r\n Anticholinergics such as atropine sulfate can cause bronchodilation, but their side effects limit their usefulness. Inhaled anticholinergics such as ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) are somewhat useful but not as useful as they are in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\r\n Any athlete who is prescribed a new medication should be asked to report any deterioration in his or her asthma. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents, either oral or in eye drop form, aspirin, and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may cause or worsen asthma and should be avoided or used cautiously. Nonproprietary preparations, such as Royal Jelly, are contraindicated in athletes with asthma.\r\n There is evidence that microaspiration of stomach acid, or reflux of stomach acid over an inflamed lower esophagus, can lead to bronchospasm in patients with asthma. Asthma control may be better in these athletes if the reflux is managed. 7 Nearly half of patients with asthma experience GERD symptoms regularly. 8 The best way to manage this is with diet (reduced acidity in the diet) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). These include Prevacid, Nexium, Aciphex, and Protonix. 7 Athletes with asthma should not smoke, and friends and relatives should be asked to avoid smoking around them.\r\n The need for influenza vaccine in adults should be assessed. Influenza vaccine is not indicated routinely for children with asthma. Emergent Therapy. Aerosolized beta-2 agonists can be given every 20 minutes by a hand-held nebulizer for three doses in an emergency situation. This then can be followed by use of up to every 2 hours until the attack has stabilized. Aminophylline can be added to the regimen after the first hour to speed resolution. Salmeterol (Serevent) takes 30 minutes to work, and it should not be used in emergencies. In general, there is a correlation with the severity of the episode and the speed of resolution.\r\n The mortality of asthma is small, less than 5000 deaths per year, but it is rising, especially in inner cities. The number of children having asthma 7 to 10 years after diagnosis is 26% to 78%. Arterial blood gases are essential in severe asthma. An increase in respiratory rate results in a decrease in PCO 2 . An increase of the PCO 2 above 40 mm\/Hg may constitute a medical emergency, and intubation may be necessary. Important indications for hospital admission of patients with asthma include cyanosis, exhaustion, difficulty speaking, and pulsus paradoxus more than 20 mm\/Hg. Pulsus paradoxus is an exaggeration of the normal variation in the pulse volume with respiration, becoming weaker with inspiration and stronger with expiration. Pulmonary function testing is an important part of diagnosis, but it should be performed when the patient is not in the midst of an acute attack.\r\n Chest radiography usually will show hyperaeration, but it should be done to rule out concurrent infection or pneumothorax. Skin prick tests and radioallergosorbent tests (RAST) may be helpful in confirming the patient's atopic status and in establishing certain allergies. They have no usefulness in testing for food allergies.\r\n Drugs may be implicated in the production of asthma, especially beta-blocking agents and prostaglandin inhibitors such as aspirin.\r\n Exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) is a condition in which vigorous physical activity triggers acute airway narrowing in people with heightened airway reactivity. The pathogenesis of EIB is associated closely with fluxes in heat and water that develop within the tracheobronchial tree during the conditioning (warming and humidification) of large volumes of air. It is more likely to occur in cold, dry environments and in the presence of environmental pollution. Twelve percent to 15% of the general population are affected by EIB. Seventy percent to 80% of patients with asthma have it. It occurs at any age, although 40% of children will have it at some time. It is distributed equally between male patients and female patients.\r\n Vigorous exercise induces an initial bronchospasm, reaching a maximum in 5 to 10 minutes. Pulmonary function returns to normal in 20 to 60 minutes, which usually is followed by a refractory period lasting several hours (30 minutes to 120 minutes). Bronchospasm will not recur during this period, and an athlete may take advantage of this in timing his or her play. Warm-up exercises (either 20 minutes of submaximal exercise or 7 30-second sprints 30 minutes before exercise) are effective in diminishing EIB.\r\n During the acute attack, the athlete may present with dyspnea, chest tightness, cough, and fatigue more than expected for the type of exercise performed. Recovery may be slow. If the testing is equivocal, an exercise challenge test using methacholine may be done. Methacholine is an inhaled bronchoconstrictor.\r\n A history should be taken for the types and levels of exercise that produce the problem, the timing, and the nature of the symptoms. Laboratory criteria for diagnosis and for severity are found in Table 6 -3. The severity of the disease is influenced by the same factors that affect asthma: the type, intensity, and duration of the exercise; the environmental conditions; the level of fitness of the athlete; the intercurrent infections; and time since the athlete's last bronchospastic episode.\r\n Exercise Testing for Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm. Assessment by exercise testing is an integral part of pulmonary testing in the athlete. When performing the calculations, it is important to use a reputable laboratory to ensure that the results may be reproducible and easily comparable. When establishing a baseline, a 10% change in some results is enough to make a diagnosis, so that reproducibility is paramount.\r\n The athlete should be told to sustain vigorous exercise for at least 5 minutes continuously, and the heart rate should exceed 70% of his or her maximum rate. Treadmills and cycle ergometers have had standard exercise programs developed for testing. It is important to note that for EIB, treadmill running is more asthmagenic than cycling.\r\n Inexpensively, peak flow meters can be used to assess pulmonary function. Standardized readings should be taken immediately before and after exercise and at 1-, 3-, 5-, 10-, and 15-minute intervals after exercise. Spirometry is more sensitive but more expensive (Fig. 6-8) . In more sophisticated laboratories, histamine or methacholine challenge can be performed. Also, drugs used for therapy can be assessed running these tests with or without the various bronchodilators.\r\n Therapy. Patients with EIB will benefit from good conditioning, which will, however, reduce the severity of EIB but not prevent it.\r\n Exercising with submaximal exercise will induce EIB. After waiting 30 minutes, one can restart exercising during the refractory period. About 50% of people who get EIB will have no more attacks for 1 to 2 hours after the first attack. These warm-up times are important for the athlete with EIB, as is the cool down afterward. Patients should avoid hyperventilation, try to use slow nasal breathing when possible, and wear a scarf or mask \r\n about 15% to 20% of the general population. Viral infections are common, but about 50% of these infections result from Hemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other bacteria such as Branhamella catarrhalis and mixed oral anaerobes can cause this problem. Chronic sinusitis may be a more subtle cause of respiratory difficulty in the athlete. Symptoms may present as facial pain, headache, toothache, post-nasal drip, cough, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, fever, and epistaxis.\r\n Diagnosis is made on history and physical examination and supplemented by radiographs of the sinuses, looking for opacification or fluid levels. CT scan of the sinus also is a good, albeit more expensive, way to make the diagnosis. Cultures of the nasal sinus often will just show normal flora and are not that helpful in diagnosis or management.\r\n Management is aimed at hydration of the athlete, adequate humidification of the air, and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Decongestants are of some value. The use of intranasal steroids such as fluticasone propionate (Flonase, Glaxo Pharmaceuticals, Research Triangle Park, NC), budesonide (Rhinocort, Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Westboro, MA), and flunisolide (Nasarel, Roche Laboratories, Nutley, NJ) is widely advocated in the acute situation, but there is a latent period of about 24 hours before these are effective.\r\n The presence of polyps or anatomic deformity may be a reason for medical failure, and surgery may be required in these patients.\r\n Exercise-induced anaphylaxis is characterized by a sensation of warmth, pruritis, cutaneous erythema, angio-edema, urticaria (giant, more than 1 cm), upper respiratory obstruction, and occasionally vascular collapse. Risk factors include previous atopic history, family atopic history, food ingestion (shellfish, celery, nuts, alcohol), weather conditions (heat, high humidity), and drug ingestion (aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).\r\n Management includes decreasing the intensity of exercise, avoiding exercising on warm, humid days, and stopping exercise at the earliest sign of itching. Also, avoiding meals 4 hours before exercise will help. Drug therapy includes antihistamines, cromglycate and epinephrine. Pretreatment does not prevent the onset of exercised-induced anaphylaxis.\r\n Cholinergic urticaria is an exaggerated cholinergic response to body warming. The athlete will develop urticarial papules after exposure to heat and humidity and exercise. Generally, the papules appear first on the wrist or upper thorax and spread to the limbs. Antihistamines are used in management.\r\n Exercise-induced angioedema is a nonitchy swelling occurring in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. It tends to involve the face and oral region. Attacks may be life threatening if the airway is involved. Prevention may be achieved with modification of exercise programs or with the use of antihistamines (diphenhydramine). In addition, selective H2-receptor blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham, Philadelphia, PA), ranitidine (Zantac, Glaxo Pharmaceuticals), famotidine (Pepcid, Merck & Co., West Point, PA), lansoprazole (Prevacid, TAP Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, IL), omeprazole (Prilosec, Astra Merck, Wayne, PA), and nizatidine (Axid, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN), have been used in the management of this condition.\r\n COPD is defined as progressive airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. It is characterized by airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion.\r\n It has been shown repeatedly that exercise programs, although not accompanied by measurable improvement in lung function, result in increased exercise tolerance and an improved sense of well-being. Arm exercises are poorly tolerated. If there is any evidence of malnutrition, improvement will yield dividends. The use of bronchodilators will be helpful for those who have some evidence of reversible bronchospasm on PFTs. Cardiopulmonary testing is the best way to correlate the symptoms of COPD with objective evidence of limitations. Usually, to increase exercise endurance, exercise must be at least at 60% of VO 2 max, three times a week.\r\n Allergic rhinitis is a common chronic condition, which can cause significant discomfort in affected patients, but will also affect performance times in elite athletes. In addition, sleep disturbances and fatigue can impair performance. Treatment as outlined earlier in this chapter is important to keep the nasal passages clear and allow maximum oxygen transport to the lungs and to decrease susceptibility to upper respiratory infections. This is especially true of athletes who often are exposed to many other individuals who may harbor viruses, which will more easily cause disease when they can enter through the disturbed mucous membranes of the nasal cavities.\r\n Pulmonary embolism is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Any athlete with dyspnea or chest pain and with a history of recent trauma or surgery to the lower extremities or history of deep vein thrombophlebitis should be suspect. Female athletes receiving estrogen therapy or birth control pills have a higher incidence of phlebitis.\r\n Sleep apnea is intermittent obstruction of airflow during sleep. It is no more common in athletes than in the general population, but its diagnosis should be entertained when an overweight recreational athlete who snores is having trouble with alertness during the day. There are easy to use sleep study kits, which patients can take home to get an easy assessment of their sleep habits.\r\n SARS is a viral infection caused by a coronavirus called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which was first reported in Asia in February 2003. It was reported by the World Health Organization to have been seen in 30 countries worldwide. The first outbreak centered in China and Hong Kong, although large outbreaks occurred in Toronto, Canada, and Singapore. In general, SARS begins with a high fever and other symptoms may include headache, an overall feeling of discomfort, and body aches. Some people also have mild respiratory symptoms at the outset. About 10% to 20% of patients have diarrhea. After 2 to 7 days, SARS patients may develop a dry cough. Most patients develop pneumonia. 3 SARS seems to spread by close person-to-person contact. It is thought to be transmitted most readily by respiratory droplets. A recent study showed that SARS might be deadlier to patients born with a gene found in 10% to 15% of people of southern-Chinese ancestry. BMC Medical Genetics, an online biomedical-research journal, first published this. The gene is known as HLA B-46. Although initial research appeared to indicate a high fatality rate for this disease, it appears to be in line with influenza epidemics. Physicians should be suspect of sudden onset of dyspnea and high fevers in athletes flying to or from endemic areas. Treatment is symptomatic.\r\n The use of hot tubs is growing in popularity in the United States. Humidifier lung has been previously described (hypersensitivity pneumonitis associated with a humidifier caused by various fungi). 2 Hot tub lung is an incompletely characterized disease associated with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) growing in hot tub water. 18 Patients present with progressively worsening respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function along with diffuse x-ray changes consisting primarily of ground-glass opacities (noncaseous granulomas). Treatment with discontinuation of hot tub use, without antimycobacterial therapy, seems to lead to prompt improvement in symptoms, pulmonary function, and radiographic abnormalities. Hypersensitivity to MAC, rather than an infection, is the likely underlying mechanism of hot tub lung.","sha":"8d768bbd83692da78dcc26e2c9a6fc9d37c4ddc2","publish_time":"2005-12-31","authors":"Marino, Nino; Bruno, Peter","journal":"Sports Medicine","doi":"10.1016\/b978-0-323-02345-0.50010-1","Title":"Sports Medicine","H index":159.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"The foregoing are perhaps the most important and widely used measures of cardiac function. This surge of neural hormones (epinephrine and norepinephrine) acts on the heart. In the highly trained athlete, heart rate may go from a low of 30 to 35 beats per minute to more than 200 beats per minute via catecholamine mediation. This increase in heart rate (and contractile force of the heart) is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system, which signals for the pumping of catecholamines. Vasoconstriction in the splanchnic organs (liver, spleen) and skin surface shunts\r\n As the central organ of the cardiovascular system, the heart acts as a continuously self-regulating pump. The vessels of the arterial system deliver oxygenated blood with other nutrients throughout the body. The following is a short glossary of terminology. \u25a0 Stroke volume is a measure of the quantity of blood, in cubic centimeters, that is ejected from the ventricles of the heart with each contraction. This measure is expressed as a percentage. There may be small variations and adjustments in preload, afterload, and mean arterial pressure. For a relatively fixed exercise task, a very efficient interplay of peripheral variables appears to adjust delivery of blood to the left ventricle. With a slight increase in heart rate or stroke volume, metabolic needs of mild exercise can be met. Heart rate tends to increase to compensate for any further drop in intravascular volume and central venous pressure. The body continues, with heart-rate increase, to try to maintain a constant cardiac output. There may be a change in autonomic balance emanating from conditioned musculature. With the improvement of oxygen extraction at the cellular level of muscle fibers, exercise of up to 50% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) does not induce a rise in heart rate. It does not seem that there are primary myocardial charges that increase stroke volume. Stroke volume is a secondary or dependent variable. This mechanism is operative as preload (venous return) increases with high-intensity activity. We are becoming more aware of concepts such as active and passive filling characteristics of the ventricles. Abnormal diastolic properties of the left ventricle can cause the heart to fail during increasing activity. In the aging heart, it is often the diastolic filling properties that will be altered. 12 A sample cardiac screening questionnaire including questions proposed by the American Heart Association is shown in Figure 6 -1. Should the results of cardiovascular examination, ECG, or stress test prove to be equivocal or abnormal, one should refer the patient to a cardiologist for additional evaluation or exercise prescription. Nevertheless, although in numbers exerciserelated death in the young is rare, we are compelled to do all that we can to identify those at great risk. Careful questioning about sudden death and cardiac disease in the subject's kin is vital. Of note, although evidence for a left ventricular outflow gradient may be absent in as many as half of subjects with HCM, diastolic abnormalities are common to all sufferers of HCM. It has been postulated that these diastolic abnormalities may further result from a disorder of Have you ever become dizzy or passed out during or after exercise? Have you ever had chest pain during or after exercise? Do you get tired more quickly than your friends do during or after exercise? Have you had high blood pressure or high cholesterol? Have you ever been told you have a heart murmur? Has any family member or relative died of heart problems or sudden death before the age of 50? Have you had a severe viral infection such as mononucleosis within the last month? Has a physician ever denied or restricted your participation in sports for any heart problems? Have any of your relatives ever had any of the following conditions? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Dilated cardiomyopathy Marfan's syndrome Long QT syndrome Significant heart arrhythmia calcium metabolism in the myocardial cells of the left ventricle and sometimes the right ventricle. DNA testing is increasingly being used with some success in screening of subjects suspected of having HCM. We someday may be able to screen and prescribe with greater confidence. Most appeared to have lesions of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. In younger patients, Kawasaki disease, an acquired childhood febrile disorder, may leave coronary lesions in as many as 25% of subjects. Diagnosis of an aberrant coronary artery should be suspected in the subject who complains of anginal pain on exertion or exercise-induced syncope. The young athlete arriving for screening will have been diagnosed with many of the severe complex malformations that would limit his or her activity. Also because of the subject's symptoms, the diagnosis is less likely to be missed. Marfan syndrome, a congenital disease with the aorta as its most important target organ, has been implicated in the sudden cardiac death of some star athletes. Recently, there has been more awareness of this disorder, especially because it appears to present in tall, slender athletes. There have been high-profile sudden deaths of volleyball players and basketball players who seemed apparently well until their deaths. Systolic left ventricular function may be severely impaired. Most notable is how little force will appear to have been delivered, but the subject will collapse and die. The subject appears remarkably resistant to resuscitation attempts. Sometimes mild or severe mitral regurgitation will be present. Good hydration of these patients is an important rule to follow. As with mitral prolapse, congenital aortic valvular disease has not been incriminated as among the important causes of sudden death in the athlete. Significant aortic regurgitation also may produce a loud systolic murmur and a diastolic \"blow.\" The same is true for most other congenital or acquired cardiac abnormalities. 10 After a careful history is taken and a careful cardiac examination is performed (at rest and after exercise), the need for noninvasive testing may arise if the diagnosis is in doubt. As mass ECG testing would not be cost-effective, reserving these traces for any subject with dizziness, syncope, or chest pain on exertion could reduce sudden athletic death by as much as 50%. Often, there also are abnormal q waves and t waves. Ventricular premature beats can signal more serious sustained ventricular arrhythmias. To further investigate ventricular and atrial arrhythmias and their daily frequencies, 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring is useful. In the event that the athlete suffers from arrhythmias that require medical therapy, ambulatory monitoring will enable us to monitor the effectiveness of the antiarrhythmic therapy as he or she performs exercise at various intensities to measure effectiveness of arrhythmia suppression. Tests could be modified to most closely reproduce the loads the athlete would encounter when engaging in his or her sport. When echocardiography or radionuclide studies are part of the test, the images are reviewed to render more information about myocardial perfusion and dynamics. Bicycle stress testing has the advantage of image acquisition without delay, but the subject must be coached (and familiar with cycling) to best use this technique and achieve the desired end point. Hemodynamics are evaluated by Doppler techniques that project a beam of ultra-high-frequency sound waves into flowing blood. With this testing modality we can detect and evaluate intracardiac shunts and stenosis and regurgitation of any of the cardiac valves. Despite the powerful noninvasive techniques we now can use readily, sometimes more invasive techniques are the tests of last resort to be used in evaluating cardiac abnormalities in the athlete, from the \"semiinvasive\" modality called transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to the clearly invasive cardiac catherization and electrophysiologic studies. We generally have categorized exercise into the large general groups of static and dynamic. Many studies have elucidated the hemodynamic changes that occur during each type of exercise. Static exercise increases systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure while heart rate and cardiac output remain unchanged. Where the volume to be ejected by the heart increases (as in mitral regurgitation), the left ventricular chamber becomes enlarged with proportionately little wall thickening. The product of these three determinants yields maximal oxygen consumption in exercise. Certain sports such as cycling share a high dynamic and static character. In subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, competitive high-intensity athletics generally are to be prohibited. The potential for aortic dissection is real. Because the primary care physician may be called on to generally screen athletes before sport participation, an understanding of the principles governing cardiac clearance is essential. Regular aerobic exercise has been labeled cardioprotective. There is an enhanced efficiency of the natural arterial dilating system mediated by nitric oxide that results from vigorous exercise. Dyspnea is defined as an abnormally uncomfortable awareness of breathing. When evaluating the degree of dyspnea in a patient, one must take into consideration factors such as the overall level of fitness of the subject and the individual's perception of how bad the shortness of breath is. Orthopnea is defined as dyspnea on assuming the supine posture. The actual mechanism of dyspnea is unknown, and the differential diagnosis of dyspnea is included in the box, Causes of Dyspnea. When hypoxia occurs as a result of a respiratory problem, the PaCO 2 level usually rises and displaces the oxygen dissociation curve to the right, which allows the percentage saturation of the hemoglobin in the arterial blood at a given level of alveolar oxygen tension (PaO 2 ) to decline. Clubbing is the broadening and thickening of the ends of the fingers. Chest pain or tightness is a common sign of many diseases and is important in the diagnosis of pulmonary-related disorders. See the box, Common Causes of Chest Pain. Minute ventilation is the tidal volume \u00d7 frequency of respiration. Circulatory function depends on cardiac output and pulmonary vascular resistance. A healthy individual at rest inspires 12 to 16 times per minute, each breath having a TV of approximately 500 ml. Using a probe clipped to a patient's finger, it measures the absorption of wavelengths of light by hemoglobin in arterial blood. Portable films are a necessary evil in some situations but never as reliable in quality. Lung scans are important in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolisms. Athletes with allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis who have a positive exercise challenge. An antigen is an agent that stimulates the production of an antibody. The antibody classically associated with allergy is the IgE immunoglobulin. As many as 40% of patients with allergic rhinitis will have asthma. Idiosyncratic asthma refers to those individuals without a history of allergy, negative skin testing results, and normal levels of IgE.\r\n Environmental and occupational factors may be potent bronchial irritants, such as ozone and the oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. The house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) or fungal spores (e.g., Aspergillus fumigatus) can cause bronchial hyperactivity. \u25a0 Bronchoscopy\/biopsy\r\n Obesity is on the rise in the United States. This data suggests a potential link between obesity and asthma. Exercise and emotional stress also can be stimuli. Therapy should be aimed at elimination of the cause of the attack. They are effective only as an inhalation or parentally. They also may cause headaches and insomnia. Because of a need for blood level monitoring, they have been less popular recently. Glucocorticoids are not bronchodilators and have most benefit in patients with acute illness with severe airway obstruction that is not resolving. Inhaled glucocorticoids are sometimes combined with beta-adrenergic agonist inhalers. Although albuterol will work immediately, Serevent (salmeterol) will take 20 minutes to take effect and therefore is not for use in emergent asthmatic attacks, rather for long-term treatment. Anticholinergics such as atropine sulfate can cause bronchodilation, but their side effects limit their usefulness. There is evidence that microaspiration of stomach acid, or reflux of stomach acid over an inflamed lower esophagus, can lead to bronchospasm in patients with asthma. These include Prevacid, Nexium, Aciphex, and Protonix. The need for influenza vaccine in adults should be assessed. Aminophylline can be added to the regimen after the first hour to speed resolution. The number of children having asthma 7 to 10 years after diagnosis is 26% to 78%. They have no usefulness in testing for food allergies. The pathogenesis of EIB is associated closely with fluxes in heat and water that develop within the tracheobronchial tree during the conditioning (warming and humidification) of large volumes of air. Twelve percent to 15% of the general population are affected by EIB. It is distributed equally between male patients and female patients. During the acute attack, the athlete may present with dyspnea, chest tightness, cough, and fatigue more than expected for the type of exercise performed. If the testing is equivocal, an exercise challenge test using methacholine may be done. Methacholine is an inhaled bronchoconstrictor. Exercise Testing for Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm. Assessment by exercise testing is an integral part of pulmonary testing in the athlete. Treadmills and cycle ergometers have had standard exercise programs developed for testing. Spirometry is more sensitive but more expensive (Fig. Exercising with submaximal exercise will induce EIB. The use of intranasal steroids such as fluticasone propionate (Flonase, Glaxo Pharmaceuticals, Research Triangle Park, NC), budesonide (Rhinocort, Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Westboro, MA), and flunisolide (Nasarel, Roche Laboratories, Nutley, NJ) is widely advocated in the acute situation, but there is a latent period of about 24 hours before these are effective. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis is characterized by a sensation of warmth, pruritis, cutaneous erythema, angio-edema, urticaria (giant, more than 1 cm), upper respiratory obstruction, and occasionally vascular collapse. Drug therapy includes antihistamines, cromglycate and epinephrine. Pretreatment does not prevent the onset of exercised-induced anaphylaxis. The athlete will develop urticarial papules after exposure to heat and humidity and exercise. It tends to involve the face and oral region. Attacks may be life threatening if the airway is involved. Prevention may be achieved with modification of exercise programs or with the use of antihistamines (diphenhydramine). If there is any evidence of malnutrition, improvement will yield dividends. The use of bronchodilators will be helpful for those who have some evidence of reversible bronchospasm on PFTs. Cardiopulmonary testing is the best way to correlate the symptoms of COPD with objective evidence of limitations. Usually, to increase exercise endurance, exercise must be at least at 60% of VO 2 max, three times a week. In addition, sleep disturbances and fatigue can impair performance. Female athletes receiving estrogen therapy or birth control pills have a higher incidence of phlebitis. It is no more common in athletes than in the general population, but its diagnosis should be entertained when an overweight recreational athlete who snores is having trouble with alertness during the day. The first outbreak centered in China and Hong Kong, although large outbreaks occurred in Toronto, Canada, and Singapore. BMC Medical Genetics, an online biomedical-research journal, first published this.

Our study therefore suggests that VSV as a vector system is a promising candidate to be used in a heterologous viral prime-boost immunization regimen against intracellular bacterial infection.\r\n Tuberculosis (TB) continues to remain a major threat to health globally. Approximately one-third of the world population has been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). 1 While most of the infected individuals mount a strong cell-mediated immune response restricting the disease to a dormant state, 2 5-10% will eventually develop active TB. 1 Approximately 2 million individuals succumb to the disease each year, making TB one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the world. 1 Because this disease predominantly affects the populations in developing countries, and in view of the fact that the incidence of infection with multidrug-resistant or extensively drugresistant strains of M.tb is on the rise, the most effective and practical means to combat TB is through vaccination.\r\n Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is the current TB vaccine that has been in use since 1920, with >3 billion individuals having been immunized to date. 3 Despite its extensive use, the efficacy of BCG remains controversial because, although it is effective at protecting against severe childhood forms of TB, its protection against adult pulmonary TB ranges from 0 to 80%, [3] [4] [5] which explains the current TB epidemic. There is therefore a recognized need to develop new TB vaccines. Among the major novel TB vaccine formulations are the viral vector systems including adenovirus (Ad), 6,7 modified vaccinia virus Ankara, 8, 9 poxvirus, 10 and influenza virus. 11 These viral-vectored TB vaccines have been evaluated as stand-alone vaccines or as boosters in heterologous prime-boost regimens. 6, 8, 10, 12, 13 In comparison with other viral systems, the recombinant adenoviral vaccine system possesses the advantages of established safety, well-characterized vectorology, and transgene expression potency. 14 Indeed, a recombinant human type 5 Ad expressing Ag85A (AdAg85A) developed in our lab was shown to be immune-protective following a single immunization in murine models. 6 However, a potential drawback of viral systems is that the initially immunized host generates a strong neutralizing antibody response against the viral backbone, limiting the efficacy of repeated immunizations with the same viral vaccine for the purpose of immune boosting. With this in mind we have developed a novel vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-vectored TB vaccine and evaluated its potential as a booster to amplify a protective mucosal immune response after prime immunization with AdAg85A.\r\n VSV has become a well established viral vector system for immunization. [15] [16] [17] Given the low pre-existing anti-VSV immunity in humans and the vector's natural tropism for the mucosa, 15 a plethora of effective VSV-vectored vaccines have been generated to induce protective humoral responses after mucosal immunization for viral diseases including human immunodeficiency virus, 18 herpes simplex virus, 19 human papillomavirus, 20 severe acute respiratory syndrome, 21 and influenza. 22 However, while these studies demonstrate a great potential for VSV to be used as a vaccine platform, its potential to elicit anti-intracellular bacterial immunity remains to be established. In particular, VSV has never been used for the purpose of anti-TB vaccination. In this study, we engineered an interferon (IFN)-inducing VSV mutant to express Ag85A and explored its potential as a boost vaccine. We found that, when delivered mucosally, this vaccine was able to www.moleculartherapy.org vol. 16 no. 6 june 2008\r\n boost mucosal T-cell responses induced by parenteral AdAg85A prime immunization effectively, thereby leading to effective protection in a murine model of pulmonary TB. Our study therefore suggests that VSV as a vector system is a promising candidate for heterologous boost immunization against an intracellular bacterial infection.\r\n An attenuated replicating VSV vector system was utilized for the development of VSVAg85A. This vector system carries a mutation in the viral matrix protein, leading to inability of the virus to block mRNA export from the nucleus of host cells and thereby restoring antiviral cytokine responses that are normally limited during wild-type VSV infection. 23 This feature of the vector was exploited as built-in immune adjuvanticity for immunization. 14 VSV was engineered to express the immunodominant M.tb antigen, Ag85A, which is a mycolyl transferase enzyme necessary for mycobacterial cell wall synthesis and a member of the Ag85 complex proteins (Ag85A\/B\/C). 24, 25 Ag85A, when expressed in genetic TB vaccines, has been shown to be one of the most immunogenic M.tb antigens. 24, 25 Ag85A was placed downstream of the human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) signal peptide, allowing secretion of the protein in order to maximize antigen presentation through both major histocompatibility complex class I and class II pathways, and thereby to enhance the immunogenicity of this antigen. 26 The tPA-Ag85A transgene was cloned into the viral genome between the G and L genes (Figure 1a) . After viral rescue and purification, A549 cells were infected with either titrated VSVAg85A or an Ad expressing Ag85A (AdAg85A) as a control. The cell lysates were separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblots were probed using a monoclonal Ag85A antibody and polyclonal VSV antibody. VSVAg85A-infected cells expressed Ag85A (Figure 1b) and also the VSV proteins (Figure 1c) . In VSVAg85A-infected cells, a single Ag85A protein band was detected, suggestive of an unprocessed form (tPA-Ag85A), whereas, in AdAg85A-infected cells, there appeared two similar-sized protein bands, suggestive of the presence of both unprocessed (tPA-Ag85A) and processed (Ag85A) forms (Figure 1b) . The Ad-or VSV-infected cells produced Ag85A protein that was at a higher molecular weight than the native Ag85A protein, likely due to the presence of attached signal peptide and post-translational modifications in infected mammalian cells. Therefore, VSVAg85A was able to incorporate the foreign M.tb transgene successfully and express it in abundance from infected cells.\r\n determination of an optimal dose of VsVAg85A for immunization In order to characterize VSVAg85A in vivo, Balb\/c mice were immunized intramuscularly (IM) with increasing doses of VSVAg85A. One week after the immunization, the mice were killed and splenocytes were stimulated ex vivo with Ag85A-specific CD4 and CD8 peptides. The frequency of occurrence of IFN-\u03b3 + T cells was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot. Naive controls exhibited no antigen-specific T cells (data not shown). There was no clear difference in the IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD4 T-cell responses among all the doses tested (Figure 2a) . Although not statistically different, the level of IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD8 T cells triggered by 1 \u00d7 10 7 plaque forming units (PFU) dose was higher than the other two doses tested (Figure 2a) . This dose was thus used for all subsequent experiments. These data also indicate that VSVAg85A is immunogenic in vivo.\r\n In view of the fact that VSVAg85A remains replication-efficient, and with the anticipation of its potential usefulness in respiratory mucosal immunization, we used the 1 \u00d7 10 7 PFU dose to examine the extent of lung tissue inflammation caused by intranasal (IN) immunization. In comparison with naive controls (Figure 2b , left panel), we observed only a slight increase in cellularity within the lung parenchyma in mice immunized IN with VSVAg85A (Figure 2b , right panel). Aside from this modest infiltrate, the overall levels of inflammation in the tissue and airway endothelium were minimal. This affirms that this dose of VSVAg85A, when delivered mucosally, is minimally inflammatory.\r\n In order to further characterize VSVAg85A immunization, we compared T-cell responses after two different routes of administration of the vector. Balb\/c mice were immunized through either the parenteral (IM) or the mucosal (IN) route, and T-cell responses were analyzed in the airway lumen, lung, and spleen over a 3-week time-course. Tetramer staining was used for estimating CD8 T cells specific for an immunodominant CD8 epitope within Ag85A. Following IM immunization, antigen-specific CD8 T cells were found mainly in the lung and spleen (Figure 3b In order to examine the functionality of T cells, the cells harvested from these three tissue compartments were stimulated with Ag85A CD4 and CD8 T-cell peptides and intracellular cytokine staining (ICCS) was carried out to measure antigen-specific, IFN\u03b3-producing T cells. As with the distribution of tetramer+ CD8 T cells, CD4 or CD8 IFN-\u03b3 + T cells predominantly populated the systemic tissues after IM immunization (Figure 4b and c, left panel), whereas undetectable levels were found at the mucosal site (Figure 4a , left panel). Such responses appeared to be dominated by CD8 T cells. In contrast, IN immunized mice generated IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 and CD8 T cells almost exclusively in the airway lumen (Figure 4a , right panel). While some cells were detected in the lung interstitium, very little systemic activation was evident in the spleen following this route of immunization (Figure 4b and c, right panels). It is interesting to note that, in contrast to the effect after IM immunization, a greater CD4 T-cell response was triggered by IN immunization. Further, the kinetics of T-cell activation resulting from these alternative routes of immunization also seemed to differ, with 1 week and 2 weeks being the time-points for peak activation after IN and IM administration, respectively. week later the naive mice as well as the immunized mice were examined for lung pathology. For this purpose, the mice were killed, the lungs were sectioned and hematoxylin and eosin stained, and representative images were presented. immune protection against M.tb challenge in the lung. To this end, mice were immunized with either IM VSVAg85A or IN VSVAg85A, with IM AdAg85A or subcutaneously administered BCG as controls. Two weeks after immunization, the mice were challenged through the airway with virulent M.tb. Four weeks after the challenge, the lungs were analyzed for bacterial burden. As observed earlier, 6, 27 BCG was able to provide ~1 log protection and IM AdAg85A provided little protection as compared to naive mice (P \u2264 0.001) (Figure 5a) . As with IM-administered AdAg85A, IM immunization with VSVAg85A also provided little protection (Figure 5a) . In contrast, IN VSVAg85A conferred a significant level of protection (~0.5 log) when compared with naive and IMimmunized mice (P \u2264 0.05) (Figure 5a) . In order to understand whether the protective T-cell responses to VSVAg85A administered IN would be sustained, mice were immunized as described earlier and challenged with M.tb at 4 weeks after immunization. Again, as observed earlier, BCG maintained ~1 log protection (P \u2264 0.001) (Figure 5b) . However, the initial protection provided by IN-administered VSVAg85A that was observed at 2 weeks had vanished in the mice when challenged at 4 weeks after immunization (Figure 5b) . These data suggest that, although IN immunization with VSV vaccine provides better protection than the IM route, such protection is relatively transient.\r\n Our observation that a single IN immunization with VSVAg85A induces only a transient protective immune response against M.tb challenge suggests that its potential use as a stand-alone vaccine is limited. For this reason, we explored the potential of using VSVAg85A as a booster vaccine. As we have reported earlier, parenteral (IM) immunization with a recombinant adenoviral-vectored vaccine expressing Ag85A (AdAg85A) fails to protect the lung, whereas airway delivery of soluble Ag85 antigens restores protection. 6, 27, 28 We therefore considered the possibility that IN immunization with VSVAg85A could be employed to boost protective immune responses locally in the lung after IM prime immunization with AdAg85A (heterologous viral prime-boost immunization regimen). A mucosally delivered viral booster will not only deposit Ag85A antigen but will also provide an inflammatory signal in the airway and, cumulatively, this approach can specifically and nonspecifically recruit antigen-specific T cells from systemic pools of T cells. Also, the use of a heterologous viral vector for the purpose of boosting circumvents the problem associated with viral neutralizing antibodies generated after prime immunization. To this end, Balb\/c mice were primed with IM AdAg85A, and 3 weeks later a boost was administered with IN VSVAg85A. Two weeks after the boost, the mice were killed and the numbers of Ag85A-specific CD8 T cells in the airway lumen, lung, and spleen were determined using Ag85A tetramer immunostaining. IM administration of AdAg85A resulted in only a few CD8 T cells detectable in the airway lumen and VSVAg85A elicited a small but sizeable number of such T cells (Figure 6a and b) . In contrast, the IM AdAg85A and VSVAg85A IN prime-and-boost regimen led to a >200-fold increase in the number of Ag85A-specific CD8 T cells in the airway lumen as compared to the numbers found after either of the stand-alone immunizations (Figure 6a and b) . Dramatic increases in CD8 T cells were also evident in the lung interstitium where there was an approximately tenfold increase in the mice that had received prime-and-boost as compared to AdAg85A IM-immunized mice and an ~100-fold increase as compared to IN VSVAg85A-immunized mice (Figure 6a and c) . Upon examination of effector and central memory T-cell surface markers including CD62L, CD127, and CD27, the majority of VSVAg85A-boosted Ag85A-specific CD8 T cells in the lung were found to be of the effector memory phenotype (data not shown). By comparison, the increase of these cells in the spleen on account of the prime-and-boost regimen was much smaller, amplified by approximately twofold and approximately fourfold when compared with AdAg85A IM and VSVAg85A IN, respectively (Figure 6a and d) .\r\n We further compared the levels of antigen-specific, IFN-\u03b3producing CD4 and CD8 T cells in the airway lumen, lung, and spleen using ICCS. There was an ~1,000-fold difference in IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 and IFN-\u03b3 + CD8 T cells in the airway lumen after the prime-and-boost regimen as compared to the numbers of these cells after either immunization administered alone (Figure 7a) . The differences in the lung and spleen cell numbers after the different immunizations were similar to those observed using tetramer staining. In the lung, the prime-and-boost regimen resulted in an approximately tenfold increase in IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 and IFN-\u03b3 + CD8 T-cell numbers relative to those after IM administration of AdAg85A alone, and an ~100-fold increase relative to IN administration of VSVAg85A alone (Figure 7b) . Although to a more modest extent, there were nevertheless threefold and sixfold increases in the cell numbers in the spleen with the prime-and-boost regimen as compared to the cell numbers found after IM AdAg85A and after IN VSVAg85A, respectively (Figure 7c) . It is interesting to note that the IN boosting had a dominant effect on CD8 T cells. These results suggest that mucosal VSVAg85A immunization represents a powerful way to boost airway luminal T-cell responses in parenterally genetically immunized hosts.\r\n Having observed a robust boosting effect by VSVAg85A on T-cell responses, we examined the protective capacity of this immunization protocol. When challenged at 2 weeks after immunization, mice immunized with the prime-and-boost regimen exhibited a >0.5 log protection when compared with naive mice or with those that had received IM AdA85A alone (P \u2264 0.01) (Figure 8a) . However, at that time-point, while the prime-and-boost regimen provided only a comparable level of protection in the lung to that provided by IN VSVAg85A alone (Figure 8a) , it did provide a better protection systemically in the spleen (P \u2264 0.05) (Figure 8b) . Further, when challenged at 4 weeks after immunization, mice immunized with IN VSVAg85A alone were no longer protected, whereas the prime-and-boost regimen was able to maintain a ~0.5 log protection in the lung (P \u2264 0.05) (Figure 8c) . It is interesting to note that the prime-and-boost regimen afforded mice a >0.5 log protection (P \u2264 0.01) in the spleen, even better than that provided by BCG (Figure 8d) . Therefore, the IM AdAg85A prime-and-IN VSVAg85A boost regimen provided better and more sustained protection from pulmonary M.tb challenge than IM AdAg85A or IN VSVAg85A alone. In comparison with several other viral vector systems utilized for TB vaccination, VSV represents a more attractive candidate because of the low incidence of antibodies to VSV in the general population and the rare occurrence of adverse outcomes following infection in humans. 14 On the basis of these considerations, VSV has been used for generating a number of effective antiviral vaccines that mediate immunity by inducing neutralizing antibodies. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] More recently, VSV-vectored vaccines have been described for immunization against malaria 29 and Yersinia pestis infection. 30 However, VSV has not been used for vaccination against M.tb and therefore this study represents the first attempt to develop a recombinant VSV TB vaccine. Additionally, an understanding of T-cell activation after VSV-vectored vaccination is yet to be fully established. Our results suggest that VSV can be used as an effective TB booster vaccine in a heterologous prime-and-boost regimen, although its protective efficacy is limited when used as a stand-alone vaccine.\r\n Although VSV causes a self-limiting infection with very mild tissue inflammatory responses in many species including humans, VSV infection can be pathogenic in mice, particularly in Balb\/c mice. 22, 23, 31 This poses a limitation to vaccine development using VSV in murine models and calls for attenuation of the virus. While a variety of methods have been reported for attenuating VSV, 16, 17, 22, 32 we employed a VSV harboring a mutant viral matrix protein that substantially attenuated the virus. In addition, this mutant VSV had an enhanced capability to induce an antiviral IFN response in host cells which would otherwise be subverted during wild-type VSV infection. 33 This feature is believed to promote the downstream adaptive immune response through cytokine production and major histocompatibility complex class I upregulation, 34 and was thus exploited as a built-in immune adjuvant in our current study. On the other hand, such strong immune adjuvant activity will enhance not only the immunogenicity of the heterologous antigen but also the immune response to VSV antigens. This may limit repeated applications of VSV vector in the same host, as is the case for adenoviral vector systems. We therefore believe that the VSV vector holds great potential to be used as a heterologous vector for boosting immune responses triggered by prime immunization with virus vectors such as Ad. Admittedly, the VSV used in our study is a replicating virus that is unlikely to be amenable to clinical application. We are developing replication-deficient VSV TB vaccines.\r\n Protection against TB is associated with a strong T cellmediated immune response, and therefore examination of the cellular responses after immunization with VSVAg85A is an important part of investigation. After IM delivery of VSVAg85A, a primarily systemic response was detected, with antigen-specific CD8 T cells populating the spleen and the lung. This route of immunization appeared to activate more IFN-\u03b3 + CD8 T cells. In contrast, VSVAg85A delivered IN activated more antigenspecific T cells in the airway. It is interesting to note that IFN-\u03b3 + cells were primarily CD4 T cells. In general, the primary response to VSVAg85A peaked at 2 weeks after immunization in the lung and spleen and peaked at 1 week in the airway lumen. The distinctive distribution profiles of T cells in response to these two routes of immunization are to be expected, because systemic immunization generates a systemic response whereas mucosal immunization leads to a mucosal response. This finding is in agreement with data from our earlier studies using a recombinant adenoviral TB vaccine. 27 The difference in the IFN-\u03b3 + T-cell profiles may be because of the fact that VSV is naturally tropic for the respiratory mucosa and can better infect epithelial cells leading to increased secretion of Ag85A which, in turn, may result in increased CD4 T-cell activation.\r\n The majority of VSV-vectored vaccines developed to date have been designed to elicit antiviral antibody responses. After mucosal delivery of VSV-vectored vaccine, the induction of mucosal and systemic neutralizing antibodies correlated with protection against challenge. 18, [20] [21] [22] [35] [36] [37] A recent study with a VSV-vectored vaccine against Y. pestis also emphasized the induction of high antibody titers although the mechanisms of protection remain to be elucidated. 30 Studies relating to human immunodeficiency virus were the first to explore the activation of systemic CD8 T cells after mucosal immunization with a VSV-vectored vaccine. 16, 32, 36, 38, 39 Another study observed the induction of a systemic CD4 T-cell response after intranasal immunization with a VSV HSV-2 vaccine. 19 In all of these studies, the examination of T-cell responses was restricted to systemic compartments. We are the first to examine the mucosal T-cell immune responses after VSVvectored immunization. We found that, despite the modest T-cell response induced by single IN immunization with VSVAg85A, when mice were challenged 2 weeks later with virulent M.tb they exhibited ~0.5 log protection in the lung as compared to the naive control. The difference between the levels of protection afforded by IN administered VSVAg85A and BCG was not significant. In contrast, IM immunization with the vaccine was unable to protect mice from M.tb challenge. We have previously observed that IM delivery of an adenoviral vector expressing Ag85A (AdAg85A) was also unable to provide significant protection. 27 The protection observed after mucosal immunization is probably mediated by the increased cellular responses in the airway lumen; we have earlier shown that this is a good correlate of protection. 27, 28 However, when mice were challenged 4 weeks after immunization, the protection conferred by a single IN delivery of VSVAg85A had disappeared. This is probably because of the waning cellular responses in the airway lumen; by 3 weeks, IFN-\u03b3 + T cells were at almost undetectable levels, although minimal numbers of antigen-specific tetramer+ CD8 T cells could still be observed.\r\n The relatively low level of T-cell responses and transient protection conferred by a single IN VSVAg85A immunization is reminiscent of another viral vaccine. This viral vaccine is an modified vaccinia virus Ankara vector expressing Ag85A (MVA85A), and this vector too induces very modest T-cell responses when used as a single delivery either mucosally or parenterally, and indeed, even after two successive intravenous administrations. 40, 41 However, MVA85A had a potent boosting effect on T-cell responses induced by heterologous priming vaccination. 9, 40, 41 This fact prompted us to continue to analyze VSVAg85A as a boost vaccine. We investigated whether an IN boost with VSVAg85A in IM administered AdAg85A-primed mice would boost memory T cells within the airway lumen and enhance protection. Indeed, the antigen-specific T cells were profoundly boosted in the airway lumen and lung, and to a lesser extent in the spleen. Upon challenge with M.tb, these mice displayed ~0.5 log protection in the lung as compared to that in naive controls. However, the level of protection in the lung conferred by this prime-and-boost regimen is not as good as that conferred by parenteral BCG immunization, although the level of systemic protection in the spleen provided by these two regimens is comparable. This observation supports the continuing use of BCG as a priming vaccine and the use of virus-based vaccine for boosting. Nevertheless, virus-based TB vaccines have potential in immunizing individuals who cannot qualify for BCG immunization, such as human immunodeficiency virus-infected children. 42 Further, it may be argued that multiple heterologous booster vaccines may be required to maintain protective immunity against M.tb throughout a human's lifetime. The demonstrated ability of AdAg85A to boost a BCG prime immunization, 12 and of VSVAg85A to boost immunity conferred by AdAg85A, lend support for the adoption of an immunization regimen of BCG prime and repeated Ad\/VSV boost.\r\n Mice. Six-to ten-week-old female Balb\/c mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratory. They were housed in a specific pathogen-free level B facility. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the Animal Research Ethics Board at McMaster University.\r\n A recombinant replication-defective Ad expressing the M.tb Ag85A was generated and purified as described earlier. 6 In order to construct VSVAg85A, Ag85A linked to the human tPA signal peptide (tPA-Ag85A) was PCR-amplified from the shuttle plasmid pJW23, using the forward primer 5\u2032-ATTGTCGACTAGAACTAGTGAATTTAG-3\u2032 so as to introduce an upstream SalI restriction site, and the reverse primer 5\u2032-ATTGCTAGCGGATCATCGGAGCTA-3\u2032 so as to introduce a downstream NheI restriction site (sites underlined). The PCR product was digested with SalI and NheI, purified, and ligated into the pVSV-XNDG plasmid 23 digested with XhoI and NheI so as to create pVSV-XNDG tPA-Ag85A. Following transformation into DH5-\u03b1 Escherichia coli cells, the recombinant plasmid was recovered, analyzed, and sequenced (MOBIX, McMaster University) in order to verify its correctness. After large-scale purification, the plasmid was co-transfected with helper plasmids so as to rescue VSVAg85A virus. The virus was subsequently amplified, purified, and titered in accordance with standard protocols. 43, 44 Immunoblotting. In order to verify protein expression after VSVAg85A infection, A549 cells were infected with the virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Additional cells were infected with AdAg85A at a multiplicity of infection of 20. At time-points of 24 and 48 hours after infection, respectively, cell lysates from the two batches were harvested in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer (50 mmol\/l Tris-Cl pH 6.8, 100 mmol\/l dithiothreitol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1% bromophenol blue, and 10% glycerol). Together with Ag85 complex, the samples were run on a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a monoclonal Ag85A antibody (clone TD-17) (1:1,000). The membrane was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000) and protein was detected using ECL on film (Kodak). The membrane was subsequently incubated with a polyclonal VSV antibody (1:5,000) followed by incubation with an Alexa Fluor 680conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000), and protein was detected using the Odyssey machine.\r\n Immunization. Both VSVAg85A and AdAg85A were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline at doses of 5 \u00d7 10 6 PFU, or 1 \u00d7 10 7 PFU, or 5 \u00d7 10 7 PFU as indicated, and were delivered through either IN or IM routes. For IM immunization, the virus was prepared in a 100 \u00b5l volume. The mice were lightly anesthetized and 50 \u00b5l of the inoculum was administered into each of the two quadriceps. For IN immunization, the virus was prepared in a 25 \u00b5l volume. The mice were lightly anesthetized and were allowed to inhale the volume of virus administered slowly with a pipette tip. For challenge experiments, the mice were immunized with BCG (Connaught strain). BCG was prepared (described in a later section) at a dose of 1 \u00d7 10 5 colony forming units in 100 \u00b5l of phosphate-buffered saline. The mice were lightly anesthetized and 50 \u00b5l of the innoculum was administered into each of the two hind quarters.\r\n Lung histology. After being isolated, the lungs were submerged in 10% formalin to fix the tissue. The tissue was processed, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Tissue samples were viewed under \u00d710 and \u00d720 magnification.\r\n The mice were killed after immunization in order to examine immunogenicity. The spleen and lung were isolated and processed as previously described. 27 After single-cell suspensions were generated, both samples were incubated in red blood cell www.moleculartherapy.org vol. 16 no. 6 june 2008 lysis buffer for 12 minutes (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Airway luminal cells were isolated from the lung after exhaustive lavage as described earlier. 27 Cells from each tissue were enumerated, resuspended in complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640, and seeded into 96-well plates. For ex vivo antigen stimulation, cells were plated with either Ag85A-specific CD4 (LTSELPGWLQANRHVKPTGS) or CD8 (MPVGGQSST) T-cell peptides at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g\/well. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay. Splenocytes were examined in order to determine the frequency of occurrence of IFN-\u03b3-secreting lymphocytes as described earlier. 45 0.5 \u00d7 10 6 Splenocytes were plated in duplicate with either no stimulus, or CD4, or CD8 peptide for 24 hours at 37 \u00b0C. Spots were enumerated using the ELISPOT counter and ImmunoSpot software.\r\n Immunostaining was carried out in order to determine the presence of antigen-specific cells and cytokine-secreting effectors, as described earlier. 27 Two million spleen and lung cells were seeded in a 96-well plate, while airway luminal cells were divided equally into wells for each condition that required examination. For ICCS, the cells were cultured with no stimulus, or with CD4, or with CD8 peptide (as described in the earlier section) for 5 hours. The antibodies used for staining for ICCS were: CD3 CyChrome, CD4 phycoerythrin-Cy7, CD8a phycoerythrin, and IFN-\u03b3 allophycocyanin (BD Pharmingen). For tetramer staining, unstimulated cells were stained with the immunodominant CD8 T-cell peptide (MPVGGQSST) of Ag85A bound to the BALB\/c major histocompatibility complex class I allele H-2L d conjugated to phycoerythrin (from Texas A&M University), CD3 CyChrome, and CD8a allophycocyanin (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). All the stained cells were run on the LSRII flow cytometer, and 100,000-300,000 events were collected per sample, depending on the tissue. fluorescence-activated cell sorting data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).\r\n Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Connaught strain) and M.tb (H37Rv strain) were cultured and prepared as described earlier. 27 For the challenge experiments, the mice were infected with 10,000 colony forming units of M.tb IN in the level III containment facility at McMaster University. The bacterial burden in the lungs and spleen was assessed, and is presented as log 10 colony forming units per organ, as described earlier. 27 Statistics. Statistical analysis was carried out using an unpaired Student's t-test, and was verified using analysis of variance and Tukey's test.

Effective vaccination strategies are needed. This translated into significantly better protective efficacy against pulmonary challenge with M.tb than either vaccine used alone. Our study therefore suggests that VSV as a vector system is a promising candidate to be used in a heterologous viral prime-boost immunization regimen against intracellular bacterial infection. 1 While most of the infected individuals mount a strong cell-mediated immune response restricting the disease to a dormant state, 2 5-10% will eventually develop active TB. There is therefore a recognized need to develop new TB vaccines. 6 However, a potential drawback of viral systems is that the initially immunized host generates a strong neutralizing antibody response against the viral backbone, limiting the efficacy of repeated immunizations with the same viral vaccine for the purpose of immune boosting. 15] [16] [17] Given the low pre-existing anti-VSV immunity in humans and the vector's natural tropism for the mucosa, 15 a plethora of effective VSV-vectored vaccines have been generated to induce protective humoral responses after mucosal immunization for viral diseases including human immunodeficiency virus, 18 herpes simplex virus, 19 human papillomavirus, 20 severe acute respiratory syndrome, 21 and influenza.

This dose was thus used for all subsequent experiments. These data also indicate that VSVAg85A is immunogenic in vivo. While some cells were detected in the lung interstitium, very little systemic activation was evident in the spleen following this route of immunization (Figure 4b and c, right panels). For this purpose, the mice were killed, the lungs were sectioned and hematoxylin and eosin stained, and representative images were presented. immune protection against M.tb challenge in the lung. Four weeks after the challenge, the lungs were analyzed for bacterial burden. However, the initial protection provided by IN-administered VSVAg85A that was observed at 2 weeks had vanished in the mice when challenged at 4 weeks after immunization (Figure 5b) . Our observation that a single IN immunization with VSVAg85A induces only a transient protective immune response against M.tb challenge suggests that its potential use as a stand-alone vaccine is limited. 6, 27, 28 We therefore considered the possibility that IN immunization with VSVAg85A could be employed to boost protective immune responses locally in the lung after IM prime immunization with AdAg85A (heterologous viral prime-boost immunization regimen). To this end, Balb\/c mice were primed with IM AdAg85A, and 3 weeks later a boost was administered with IN VSVAg85A. Two weeks after the boost, the mice were killed and the numbers of Ag85A-specific CD8 T cells in the airway lumen, lung, and spleen were determined using Ag85A tetramer immunostaining. There was an ~1,000-fold difference in IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 and IFN-\u03b3 + CD8 T cells in the airway lumen after the prime-and-boost regimen as compared to the numbers of these cells after either immunization administered alone (Figure 7a) . Further, when challenged at 4 weeks after immunization, mice immunized with IN VSVAg85A alone were no longer protected, whereas the prime-and-boost regimen was able to maintain a ~0.5 log protection in the lung (P \u2264 0.05) (Figure 8c) . 22, 23, 31 This poses a limitation to vaccine development using VSV in murine models and calls for attenuation of the virus.

Recurring outbreaks of EV71 have been reported in several countries. The current lack of approved anti-EV71 therapy has prompted intense research into antiviral development. Several strategies -ranging from target-based chemical design to compound library screenings -have been employed, while others revisited compound series generated from antiviral developments against poliovirus and human rhinoviruses. These efforts have given rise to a diversity of antiviral candidates that include small molecules and nonconventional nucleic-acid-based strategies. This review aims to highlight candidates with potential for further clinical development based on their putative modes of action.\r\n Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is described as one of the human enterovirus A species under the genus Enterovirus in the Picornaviridae family of viruses, which includes poliovirus [1] . While efforts to eradicate poliovirus through vaccination programs have limited the number of polio-endemic countries to just four (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan) [2], EV71 has emerged as an important non-polio neurotropic enterovirus. EV71 was first isolated from patients with central nervous system diseases in California between 1969 and 1974 [3]. The same authors also described the EV71 prototype strain, BrCr, isolated from a twomonth-old patient who presented with aseptic meningitis. Since then, EV71 outbreaks have been reported in several countries beyond North America, including Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore [4]. These outbreaks have mainly involved young children, with most cases displaying mild, self-limiting hand, foot and mouth disease; however, EV71 outbreaks have also been associated with a variety of severe neurological complications that can deteriorate rapidly to involve cardiopulmonary failure with high mortality rates. Transmission of EV71 can occur rapidly via the fecal-oral and droplet and\/or aerosol routes. During the largest EV71 outbreak to date, in Taiwan in 1998, more than 100,000 children were affected, with 405 severe cases involving neurological or cardiopulmonary complications, of which 78 were fatal [5] .","text_body":"The spectrum of EV71-associated neurological diseases includes aseptic meningitis, brain stem encephalitis and poliomyelitis-like acute flaccid paralysis. Like poliomyelitis, severe EV71 infections can result in permanent neurological damage. In a long-term study of children who survived neurologically involved EV71 infections during the 1998 outbreak in Taiwan, patients who had a more severe infection (involving both neurological and cardiopulmonary complications) displayed signs of neurologic sequelae, impaired neurodevelopment and impaired cognitive functions [6] .\r\n There is currently no effective vaccine or antiviral against EV71. Treatments for acute EV71 infections with neurological manifestations mainly aim to alleviate symptoms. Mechanical cardiopulmonary support systems and the administration of milrinone, a positive inotropic agent, have been used to prevent cardiopulmonary failure and thus improve the clinical outcome of patients [7] . The lack of antiviral treatment options against EV71 remains a worrying situation, however, because EV71 has been found to circulate endemically with peak activity in warmer seasons (e.g. summer to fall) [8] . Considering the propensity of EV71 to cause severe neurological diseases in children, there is a need to develop effective antiviral treatment options to prevent or reduce EV71related deaths and long-term neuropathy in the next EV71 global outbreak.\r\n In this review, we focus on documenting recent developments towards an antiviral for EV71 infections. Previous reviews have covered the development of antivirals targeting picornaviruses or enteroviruses in general [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] ; however, with the exception of poliovirus, EV71 has distinguished itself from other enteroviruses in terms of circulation and severity of associated diseases. In contrast to poliovirus, against which highly effective vaccines are available, the global population remains largely unprotected against EV71. Our review, therefore, highlights promising anti-EV71 strategies and their putative modes of inhibition.\r\n An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral infection and replication can enable the identification of potential antiviral targets. Although the exact mechanisms for EV71 replication have not been elucidated, picornaviruses generally share a highly similar virus architecture and mode of replication. Picornaviruses are non-enveloped viruses of $30 nm in diameter with an icosahedral capsid made up of 60 protomers, each of which is, in turn, made up of four structural proteins: VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. The picorna-virus genome is encoded as a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of 7500-8000 bases that consists of an open reading frame flanked by 5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions (UTRs).\r\n Upon virus attachment and entry into the host cell, an uncapping event occurs to release the RNA genome into the cell. Covalently attached to the 5 0 end is a viral protein, VPg (3B), which is cleaved by a cellular enzyme during early infection, whereas the 3 0 end has a poly(A) tract. The 5 0 and 3 0 UTRs are highly structured regions that interact with a variety of viral and host proteins in translation and RNA synthesis events.\r\n Cap-independent translation of the viral RNA takes place through the recruitment of host replication machinery at the internal ribosome entry site located in the 5 0 UTR of the viral RNA. The viral polyprotein can be divided into three precursor molecules (P1, P2 and P3) (Fig. 1) . P1 contains all the viral capsid proteins, VP1-4, and P2 and P3 carry the viral non-structural proteins. Functional viral proteins and precursor proteins are produced upon maturation cleavage of the polyprotein by the virusencoded proteases 2A pro and 3C pro . Negative RNA intermediates of Graphical overview of picornavirus replication. Virus particle first attaches to host cell surface via a cellular receptor before entering and uncoating to unveil the viral RNA genome. Viral RNA is translated by cellular translational machinery to give a polyprotein that is then cleaved by the virus-encoded proteases 2A pro and 3C pro to give functional precursor proteins (e.g. 2BC and 3CD) and individual proteins. Within virus-induced membrane vesicles, viral RNA (+) is copied by the viral RNA polymerase, 3D pol , to give (\u00c0) strand RNA intermediates, which in turn provide the template for the synthesis of (+) strand viral RNA. The (+) strand viral RNAs are used to generate more (\u00c0) strand viral RNAs, translated into viral proteins or packaged into progeny virions. Lysis of host cells will result in the release of progeny virions. Adapted and modified from Figure 2 in Ref. [10] and Figure 4 In Ref. [16] .\r\n the viral genome are also generated to serve as templates for the replication of positive-sense RNA viral genomes. These events typically take place in virus-induced membrane complexes within host cells. Progeny virions are then self-assembled from the synthesized viral proteins and RNA genomes before their subsequent release from the host cell [16] (Fig. 1 ).\r\n Receptor binding is an essential event in virus infection. The ability to recognize and bind specific receptors typically determines the host range and tissue tropism of viruses. The recent characterizations of EV71 receptors have opened the door to the development of antiviral strategies targeting EV71 entry into host cells. At least three cellular receptors for EV71 have been reported to date. Human scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2) was described as a receptor for EV71 strains from all three genogroups (A, B and C) [17] . SCARB2 is a type III double-transmembrane protein primarily located in endosomes, although surface expression of SCARB2 has also been demonstrated [17] . The second EV71 receptor, human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1\/ CD162), is a sialomucin membrane protein expressed mainly in leukocytes, including dendritic cells and macrophages [18] . PSGL-1 was postulated to facilitate the viremic phase of EV71 by enabling replication in circulating leukocytes [19] . Using monoclonal antibodies targeting different parts of PSGL-1, the authors identified the N-terminal region as a crucial interaction site for EV71. The sialic acid residue of PSGL-1 might also be important for EV71 interaction. In the study by Yang et al. [20] , sialidase removal of sialic acid residues from plasma membrane proteins was able to protect EV71-susceptible DLD-1 intestinal cells from infection. In another study, EV71 was found to infect immature dendritic cells via DC-SIGN. Infection was reduced by up to 50% when anti-DC-SIGN antibody was used to block DC-SIGN [21] .\r\n The potential for the development of antiviral strategies targeting EV71 receptor binding was demonstrated in all these studies. Anti-SCARB2 antibodies and soluble SCARB2-Fc conjugates were able to inhibit EV71 infection in a dose-dependent manner [17] . Likewise, soluble PSGL-1, monoclonal antibodies targeting the Nterminal of PSGL-1 [19] and sialylated glycans purified from human milk [20] displayed dose-dependent inhibition of EV71 in co-infection and pretreatment experiments. Unfortunately, these were unable to inhibit EV71 infection completely at the highest concentrations tested, suggesting the involvement of multiple receptors during EV71 infection. This can be addressed in the future by the combined administration of inhibitors targeting different EV71 receptors. The potential discovery of more EV71 receptors in the future (in particular, neural-specific receptors) might eventually lead to the development of effective receptor inhibitors that can prevent EV71-induced neuropathology.\r\n The hydrophobic pocket within the viral protein, VP1, is a wellknown target for antiviral design because its occupancy by suitable compounds will stabilize the virus capsid and prevent uncoating of virus for RNA release [22] . Some of the more prominent series of capsid-binding compounds include the WIN series from Sterling-Winthrop (e.g. Pleconaril) [23] , the SCH series from Schering Plough (e.g. SCH 48973) [24] and R 77975-related compounds from the Janssen Research Foundation (e.g. Pirodavir) [25] . Although antiviral activity was claimed for a broad spectrum of picornaviruses, EV71 was notably absent from the list of picornaviruses tested in these studies. The characteristics and clinical developments of picornavirus capsid-binding molecules are detailed in several comprehensive reviews [9, 13, 15] . After the 1998 Taiwan outbreak of EV71, Pleconaril was tested against EV71 but failed to prevent virus-induced cytopathic effects in cell cultures [26] . In view of the emergence of EV71 as a clinically important picornavirus, there is a need to re-evaluate more of these compounds against EV71.\r\n Using WIN compounds as templates, a series of imidazolidone derivatives were designed through computer modeling, synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit EV71-induced cytopathic effects in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. Several lead molecules with strong inhibition against all three genogroups of EV71 (EC 50 = 2.13-4.67 mM) and low cytotoxicity (CC 50 > 25 mM) were discovered. A series of publications by the same group later documented the various chemical modifications that improved antiviral activity, including substitutions on the phenoxyl group (BPROZ-194, EC 50 = 1.55 mM), oxime ether group addition (BPROZ-101, EC 50 = 0.0012 mM) and methyl group addition (BPROZ-033, EC 50 = 0.009 mM) [27] . These compounds were evaluated for anti-EV71 activity in a murine model with promising results, although a current lack of funding is impeding progress to clinical trials (S.R. Shih, pers. commun.).\r\n Oxime-ether derivatives of Pirodavir displayed improved metabolic stability and antiviral activity against a greater spectrum of picornaviruses relative to Pirodavir [28] . Most notably, one of these compounds, BTA39, inhibited EV71 with an EC 50 of 0.001 mM and a reported CC 50 ! 4.588 mM [29] .\r\n Bovine lactoferrin and human lactoferrin were found to inhibit EV71 infection in RD cells during early stages of infection at a mean EC 50 of 10.5-24.5 mg\/ml and 103.3-185.0 mg\/ml, respectively [30] . Bovine lactoferrin delayed EV71-induced paralysis and death for up to two weeks post-infection in 17-day-old mice when co-injected with EV71, and interaction assays using conjugated antibodies demonstrated direct binding of lactoferrin with VP1 and cell surfaces [31] . These suggested lactoferrin's role in preventing virus attachment by blocking cellular receptors and\/or receptor-interaction sites on EV71. The exact antiviral mechanism of lactoferrin remains to be determined; however, its potency as an early inhibitor of EV71 has led to the authors of these studies to propose investigating the ingestion of milk as a prophylaxis.\r\n Suramin, a polysulfonate, was shown to be an effective inhibitor of HIV replication in infected patients. Polysulfonates are known to be multi-targeting inhibitors of HIV, with viral targets including reverse transcriptase and the viral envelope gp120 glycoprotein [32] . A suramin analog, NF449, 4,4 0 ,4 00 ,4 000 -(carbonylbis(imino-5,1,3-benzenetriylbis(carbonylimino)))tetrakis-benzene-1,3-disulfonic acid, was identified as an early inhibitor of EV71 infection (virus uncoating or host receptor binding) with an EC 50 of 6.7 mM and CC 50 of >1000 mM in a screen for anti-EV71 compounds in the LOPAC1280 drug library (Sigma-Aldrich) [33] . NF449-resistant EV71 strains isolated in the same study displayed mutations in the viral capsid protein VP1, suggesting VP1 as a putative target of NF449.\r\n Translation of the viral RNA is the next key step of virus replication. Because the virus essentially uses cellular machinery for protein translation, it is important to develop antiviral strategies that inhibit viral protein synthesis without affecting host cell translation events. Currently, there are no reports of viral-specific small-molecule inhibitors of protein synthesis with activity against EV71. Amantadine was found to inhibit cap-independent translation initiated by the EV71 internal ribosome entry site in a bicistronic reporter system, although direct antiviral activity was not verified [34] . A more promising but non-conventional antiviral approach targeting viral RNA translation might be RNA interference (RNAi).\r\n The potential of nucleic-acid-based therapy can be seen from the FDA approval of fomivirsen (Vitravene) for use against cytomegalovirus retinitis [35] . Many RNAi-based antiviral therapeutics are currently undergoing various phases of clinical trials against viruses such as HIV-1, respiratory syncytial virus and hepatitis C virus [36] .\r\n Several highly conserved sequences have been identified as targets for RNAi in the EV71 genome. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and plasmid-encoded short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were found to effectively block replication of EV71 when targeted against 3 0 UTR [37] or regions encoding the structural proteins (e.g. VP1 and VP2) [38] and non-structural proteins (e.g. 2C, 3C and 3D) [37, 39] . Two of these studies reported the greatest inhibitory effects in targeting the viral RNA polymerase 3D [39, 40] . siRNA and plasmid-encoded shRNA targeting 3D were able to prevent EV71-induced paralysis, weight loss and death in suckling mice when delivered via the oral or intraperitoneal route [40] . The authors also observed similar antiviral effects for nucleotides delivered with or without a lipid carrier. These promising preclinical results should be followed up with clinical trials for RNAbased anti-EV71 therapeutics.\r\n Aside from their roles in the maturation cleavages of the viral polyprotein, the EV71-encoded proteases 2A and 3C also target several host proteins, such as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G [41] and cleavage stimulation factor 64 [42] , to halt host protein synthesis and induce apoptosis [43] . The essential roles of these proteases in virus replication make them attractive targets for antiviral therapeutics.\r\n Several peptide aldehydes were designed to irreversibly inhibit human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C pro by forming covalent adducts (reviewed in Ref. [9] ). One of these compounds, rupintrivir (AG-7088, Pfizer) reached phase II clinical trials but further studies were ceased after it displayed poor efficacy in natural infection cases of HRV [44] .\r\n Kuo et al. [45] developed a series of compounds based on rupintrivir and tested against EV71 3C pro in vitro. A compound, 10b, was identified as a potent inhibitor with EC 50 of 0.018 mM while showing no toxicity (CC 50 > 25 mM). Further studies are needed to evaluate the compound's efficacy in vivo. More recently, rupintrivir was shown to inhibit EV71 with an EC 50 of 0.8 mM using a real-time, cell-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay and plaque reduction assay [46] . Compound 1, an orally bioavailable 3C pro inhibitor developed in parallel with rupintrivir, also showed in vitro antiviral properties against several other human enteroviruses and should also be evaluated for anti-EV71 properties [47] .\r\n The highly conserved picornavirus protein 2C is a multifunctional protein that possesses nucleoside triphosphatase activity [48] and was shown to be involved in the synthesis of the viral negativestrand RNA [49] and encapsidation of progeny virions in poliovirus [50] . EV71 2C protein was reported to recruit host-encoded reticulon 3 in forming replication complexes [51] .\r\n Metrifudil, N-(2-methylphenyl)methyl-adenosine and N 6 -benzyladenosine were identified as inhibitors of EV71 in the same screen as NF449 (inhibitors of virus attachment, entry and uncoating). Reported EC 50 of 1.3 mM (metrifudil) and 0.10 mM (N 6 -benzyladenosine) were derived against EV71 pseudovirus (structural genes replaced by firefly luciferase gene). Metrifudil and N 6 -benzyladenosine, both adenosine receptor agonists, also showed low cytotoxicity with CC 50 of >50 mM and 3300 mM, respectively [33] . The authors managed to isolate drug-resistant EV71 with mutations in 2C proteins after three passages, thus suggesting non-conserved regions in 2C as probable targets of the compounds.\r\n Picornavirus 3A protein is an essential, multifunctional protein that has been shown to modulate the host cell's intracellular membrane transport [52] . Protein 3A functions primarily in its precursor form, 3AB, which has RNA-binding properties and is known to stimulate the cleavage of 3CD pro and the activity of 3D RNA polymerase 3D pol [53, 54] .\r\n Enviroxime is a benzimidazole derivative that inhibits rhinoviruses and poliovirus in vitro by targeting protein 3A [55, 56] . Recently, enviroxime was reported to have strong antiviral effects against EV71 with an EC 50 of 0.15 mM [57] . Enviroxime, however, was unable to show significant clinical effect (p > 0.05) against HRV9, with poor bioavailability and gastrointestinal side-effects observed in trial subjects [58] . Vinlyacetylene analogs of enviroxime were reported to display better oral bioavailability while retaining protein 3A targeting antiviral activity against poliovirus [59] and, therefore, should be evaluated for anti-EV71 activity ( Table 1) . \r\n Other scholars have reported several functional analogs of enviroxime that also target protein 3A. GW5074, 3-(3,5-dibromo-4hydroxybenzylidine-5-iodo-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one), is a Raf-1 inhibitor identified as an inhibitor of EV71 in the same drug library screen described previously for metrifudil (inhibitors of 2C protein). GW5074 was found to have a CC 50 of 170 mM and inhibited EV71 pseudovirus at an EC 50 of 2.0 mM. Post-infection addition of 50 mM of GW5074 also showed 10 2 to 10 3 -fold of inhibition [33] . The target of GW5074, identified in a later study, was found to be the same region targeted by enviroxime in the protein 3A [60] . GW5074 is currently being evaluated for in vivo anti-EV71 activity in a murine model (M. Arita, pers. commun.).\r\n The picornavirus 3D RNA polymerase is involved in several crucial replication events besides the incorporation of nucleotides during the synthesis of negative and positive viral RNA strands. Studies have shown that 3D pol is responsible for the uridylation of VPg, which confers the priming function of VPg during RNA replication [61] . Viral protein 3CD, the precursor form of 3D pol , is also involved in polyprotein processing [62] and promotes RNA synthesis by binding to the 5 0 cloverleaf structure on the viral RNA [63] .\r\n DTriP-22 is a synthetic compound from a series of piperazinecontaining, pyrazolo [3,4-d] pyrimidine derivatives that was identified as a novel class of compounds with anti-EV71 activities. This compound was evaluated to have an EC 50 of 0.15-0.98 mM against strains from all genotypes of EV71 and a CC 50 greater than 100 mM. It was found to suppress the synthesis of both positive and negative strands of viral RNA during EV71 infection, and subsequent analyses of resistant viruses identified DTriP-22's target as the RNA polymerase of EV71, 3D pol [64] .\r\n Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) is a polyanionic compound with broad-spectrum antiviral activity reported against a variety of viruses (e.g. HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus). It was recently reported to be a potent EV71 inhibitor with a plaque reduction assay derived EC 50 of 2.9 mM, while displaying low cytotoxicity in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells with a CC 50 of 211 mM [65] . The authors managed to rule out ATA targeting of viral adsorption, viral RNA translation and the viral proteases (2A pro and 3C pro ) while observing ATA inhibition of RNA elongation by EV71 3D pol .\r\n Ribavirin is a broad-spectrum antiviral that has been used in treating hepatitis C virus infections (in combination with interferon-a) [66] and severe respiratory syncytial virus infections [67] . Studies have shown that the main antiviral mechanism of ribavirin is through lethal mutagenesis of viruses during RNA replication events [68] . Ribavirin was found to inhibit EV71 in RD cells with EC 50 of 65 mg\/ml (266 mM) while preventing EV71-induced paralysis and death in mice [69] . With continued progress in antiviral development for EV71, ribavirin might prove to be clinically useful for EV71 infections in the future, when used at lower concentrations in combination with other antivirals.\r\n Epigallocatechin gallate. Polyphenolic compounds isolated from green tea leaves (Camellia sinensis) were tested for their antiviral properties against EV71. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was found to be the most potent of these compounds with postinfection addition of 10 mM of EGCG resulting in 54% reduction in plaque formation, while EV71-induced cytopathic effects were reduced by two-fold and viral RNA levels were significantly decreased (p < 0.05, treated vs control). EGCG's potency as an anti-EV71 agent among the polyphenols tested correlated with its high antioxidative capacity [70] . EV71 infection was observed to result in increased oxidative stress, while cells deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase supported more efficient EV71 replication [71] . The association between cellular redox status and EV71 replication led the authors to suggest EGCG inhibits EV71 replication by modulating oxidative stress. However, it remains unclear whether this association represents a direct causal relationship between EGCG and EV71 inhibition.\r\n The induction of Type I interferons (IFNs; e.g. interferon-a\/b) is an early, non-specific host immune response to viral infections that can lead to the induction of antiviral mechanisms. Injection of 10 mg of polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a potent IFN inducer, into mice 12 hours before EV71 inoculation resulted in increased serum levels of IFN-a, improved survival rate and significantly decreased tissue viral load (p < 0.05, treated vs control) and mortality [72] . Aloe-emodin. Aloe-emodin, a plant-derived anthraquinone derivative, was able to induce a 2.5-fold increase in IFN-a expression in human medullablastoma (TE-671) cells while showing low toxicity to both human promonocyte (HL-CZ) and TE-671 cell lines (CC 50 of 2632 mg\/ml and 2881 mg\/ml, respectively). Pretreatment of cells from both cell lines with aloe-emodin resulted in lowered plaque formation when infected with EV71 (EC 50 of 0.14 mg\/ml and 0.52 mg\/ml, respectively) [73] . The resulting high therapeutic index (CC 50 \/EC 50 ) values for aloe-emodin suggest its therapeutic potential as an anti-EV71 compound.\r\n Chloroquine was used as an inhibitor of virus uncoating in a study of EV71-induced apoptosis whereby the experiments were not designed to investigate chloroquine's anti-EV71 characteristics. Nonetheless, treatment with 1.2 mM of chloroquine resulted in a 10 4 -fold reduction of EV71 RNA synthesis [74] .\r\n The antimalarial drug chloroquine has gained interest as a potent antiviral drug, with studies showing its antiviral activities against diverse viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [75] and HIV [76] . Investigations into the inhibitory mechanisms of chloroquine on these viruses showed a variety of targets and processes involved. Given the varied antiviral pathways of chloroquine, the authors' claim of uncoating inhibition has to be verified with further experiments. However, the experience from the use of chloroquine in malaria treatment and its wide availability add to the appeal of investigating its anti-EV71 potential.\r\n Allophycocyanin. Allophycocyanin is a red fluorescent protein purified from the marine algae Spirulina platensis that has been found to prevent EV71-induced apoptosis, delay viral RNA synthesis and reduce plaque formation at an EC 50 of 0.1 mM and CC 50 of 1.52 mM in post-infection experiments on Vero cells [77] . The specific targets for inhibition by allophycocyanin are currently unknown.\r\n Raoulic acid. Raoulic acid was purified from whole-plant extract of a New Zealand plant, Raoulia australis, and tested for antiviral activity against a wide range of viruses. It has a CC 50 of 65.86 mg\/ ml in Vero cells and was able to inhibit EV71 with an EC 50 of less than 0.1 mg\/ml, giving it a therapeutic index of greater than 656.8 [78] . Drug treatment was performed post-infection, and the targets for inhibition were not investigated in the study.\r\n Ursolic acid. Ursolic acid is a triterpenoid purified from the water extract of Ocimum basilicum, a herb commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. Ursolic acid showed low cytotoxicity against Hep G2 (hepatoblastoma-derived) cells (CC 50 = 100.5 mg\/ml) and inhibited EV71-induced cytopathic effects (EC 50 = 0.5 mg\/ml) [79] . Time-of-addition studies revealed only post-infection inhibition of EV71 for the lower doses of ursolic acid tested (0.125 and 0.25 mg\/ml), although the exact mechanisms of inhibition remain unclear.\r\n Because most of the antiviral agents of EV71 in the literature are only in the preliminary stages of development (i.e. in vitro studies), promising candidates were selected based on their antiviral potencies and cytotoxicity profiles. Among the compounds mentioned in this review, those that are approved for clinical use in other diseases (e.g. chloroquine) or are generally non-toxic (e.g. lactoferrin) are attractive candidates for evaluation in vivo and in clinical trials.\r\n Earlier efforts in the development of antiviral agents against HRV and poliovirus have yielded compound series with antipicornaviral activities. Research into these series, however, seems to have ceased with the highly successful implementation of oral polio vaccine. These compounds might still prove useful as anti-EV71 agents or lead molecules for designing effective anti-EV71 agents, as exemplified by the development of anti-EV71 capsid binders, and should be evaluated against current EV71 strains. In fact, the extensive pharmacokinetic characterizations in various stages of clinical trials for compounds such as Pleconaril (capsid binder), rupintrivir (3C pro inhibitor) and enviroxime (3A inhibitor) can serve to inform future developments of anti-EV71 agents.\r\n The mechanisms behind the neuropathogenesis of EV71 infection are currently unknown. Several theories have been proposed, including host immune-mediated inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) and neural apoptotic cell death as EV71 infection spreads to the CNS [80] . A murine study reported retrograde axonal transport to be the major transmission route for EV71 neuroinvasion, in contrast to a hematogenous transmission with virus crossing the blood-brain barrier. Skeletal muscle was found to serve as an important site for viral replication and entry into the CNS via peripheral nerves innervating the infected site [81] . In fatal EV71 infection cases, patients usually present with three to five days of fever, headache, oral ulcers and vesicular rashes on hand, foot or buttocks that test positive for EV71 before rapid deterioration to severe disease [82] . The lag time between primary infection to severe neural disease might prove to be an important window of opportunity for antiviral intervention. Although the neuropathogenesis of EV71 would argue for a systemic antiviral that can cross the blood-brain barrier, other routes of administration might also prove to be useful in preventing EV71 neuroinvasion and transmission by inhibiting EV71 replication at other sites of infection (e.g. skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal lining and vesicular rashes on the skin).\r\n With no antiviral or prophylactic available for severe EV71 infections, all available antiviral options should be considered pending future progress in our understanding of disease progression in EV71 infection and future reports on the in vivo efficacies and pharmacokinetics of antiviral candidates. An effective antiviral is an essential tool in nullifying the growing threat of EV71 as a neurotopic virus. Even as the search for an EV71 vaccine continues, development of antiviral agents remain pertinent, as seen in the case of poliovirus, in which the lack of antiviral options is preventing a complete eradication of polio [56] .","sha":"c699dd5f1bbe89f93455603af615f8138fa6b56e","publish_time":"2010-12-31","authors":"Wu, Kan X.; Ng, Mary M.-L.; Chu, Justin J.H.","journal":"Drug Discovery Today","doi":"10.1016\/j.drudis.2010.10.008","Title":"Drug Discovery Today","H index":157.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"The spectrum of EV71-associated neurological diseases includes aseptic meningitis, brain stem encephalitis and poliomyelitis-like acute flaccid paralysis. There is currently no effective vaccine or antiviral against EV71. Treatments for acute EV71 infections with neurological manifestations mainly aim to alleviate symptoms. In contrast to poliovirus, against which highly effective vaccines are available, the global population remains largely unprotected against EV71. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral infection and replication can enable the identification of potential antiviral targets. Upon virus attachment and entry into the host cell, an uncapping event occurs to release the RNA genome into the cell. Covalently attached to the 5 0 end is a viral protein, VPg (3B), which is cleaved by a cellular enzyme during early infection, whereas the 3 0 end has a poly(A) tract. Negative RNA intermediates of Graphical overview of picornavirus replication. Viral RNA is translated by cellular translational machinery to give a polyprotein that is then cleaved by the virus-encoded proteases 2A pro and 3C pro to give functional precursor proteins (e.g. 2BC and 3CD) and individual proteins. The (+) strand viral RNAs are used to generate more (\u00c0) strand viral RNAs, translated into viral proteins or packaged into progeny virions. Adapted and modified from Figure 2 in Ref. [ Receptor binding is an essential event in virus infection. The recent characterizations of EV71 receptors have opened the door to the development of antiviral strategies targeting EV71 entry into host cells. The second EV71 receptor, human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1\/ CD162), is a sialomucin membrane protein expressed mainly in leukocytes, including dendritic cells and macrophages [18] . Using monoclonal antibodies targeting different parts of PSGL-1, the authors identified the N-terminal region as a crucial interaction site for EV71. The sialic acid residue of PSGL-1 might also be important for EV71 interaction. In another study, EV71 was found to infect immature dendritic cells via DC-SIGN. Infection was reduced by up to 50% when anti-DC-SIGN antibody was used to block DC-SIGN [21] . The potential for the development of antiviral strategies targeting EV71 receptor binding was demonstrated in all these studies. Bovine lactoferrin and human lactoferrin were found to inhibit EV71 infection in RD cells during early stages of infection at a mean EC 50 of 10.5-24.5 mg\/ml and 103.3-185.0 mg\/ml, respectively [30] . Bovine lactoferrin delayed EV71-induced paralysis and death for up to two weeks post-infection in 17-day-old mice when co-injected with EV71, and interaction assays using conjugated antibodies demonstrated direct binding of lactoferrin with VP1 and cell surfaces [31] . A suramin analog, NF449, 4,4 0 ,4 00 ,4 000 -(carbonylbis(imino-5,1,3-benzenetriylbis(carbonylimino)))tetrakis-benzene-1,3-disulfonic acid, was identified as an early inhibitor of EV71 infection (virus uncoating or host receptor binding) with an EC 50 of 6.7 mM and CC 50 of >1000 mM in a screen for anti-EV71 compounds in the LOPAC1280 drug library (Sigma-Aldrich) [33] . Currently, there are no reports of viral-specific small-molecule inhibitors of protein synthesis with activity against EV71. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and plasmid-encoded short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were found to effectively block replication of EV71 when targeted against 3 0 UTR [37] or regions encoding the structural proteins (e.g. VP1 and VP2) [38] and non-structural proteins (e.g. 2C, 3C and 3D) [37, 39] . One of these compounds, rupintrivir (AG-7088, Pfizer) reached phase II clinical trials but further studies were ceased after it displayed poor efficacy in natural infection cases of HRV [44] . Compound 1, an orally bioavailable 3C pro inhibitor developed in parallel with rupintrivir, also showed in vitro antiviral properties against several other human enteroviruses and should also be evaluated for anti-EV71 properties [47] .

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is known to function in the development of PAH. Losartan, a specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is a well-known antihypertensive drug with a potential role in regulating angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a recently found regulator of RAS. To determine the effect of losartan on smoke-induced PAH and its possible mechanism, rats were daily exposed to cigarette smoke for 6 months in the absence and in the presence of losartan. Elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), thickened wall of pulmonary arteries with apparent medial hypertrophy along with increased angiotensin II (Ang II) and decreased ACE2 levels were observed in smoke-exposed-only rats. Losartan administration ameliorated pulmonary vascular remodeling, inhibited the smoke-induced RVSP and Ang II elevation and partially reversed the ACE2 decrease in rat lungs. In cultured primary pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) from 3-and 6-month smoke-exposed rats, ACE2 levels were significantly lower than in those from the control rats. Moreover, PASMCs from 6-month exposed rats proliferated more rapidly than those from 3month exposed or control rats, and cells grew even more rapidly in the presence of DX600, an ACE2 inhibitor. Consistent with the in vivo study, in vitro losartan pretreatment also inhibited cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced cell proliferation and ACE2 reduction in rat PASMCs. The results suggest that losartan may be therapeutically useful in the chronic smoking-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH and ACE2 may be involved as part of its mechanism. Our study might provide insight into the development of new therapeutic interventions for PAH smokers.","text_body":"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a group of diseases characterized by a progressive increase of pulmonary vascular resistance that finally cause right ventricular failure and premature death (Chaouat et al., 2008) . It has been generally accepted and acknowledged that alterations in the pulmonary vasculature, commonly marked by vascular proliferation\/fibrosis, remodeling, and vessel occlusion, leads to most, if not all, forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (Humbert et al., 2004) . As a key factor blamed for the alterations in the pulmonary vasculature, cigarette smoking has been reported to result in muscularization of pulmonary vessels in the presence or absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Wright et al., 2003 (Wright et al., , 2004 Churg et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2002) . Moreover, increased expression of vasoactive mediators (e.g., endothelin-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor) have been detected in the guinea pig lungs after chronic smoke exposure and those mediators are reported to be associated with vascular remodeling and elevated pulmonary arterial pressure . However, the precise mechanisms by which chronic cigarette smoke exposure produces PAH are still poorly understood.\r\n The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH in a number of studies. For instance, increased expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in pulmonary arteries has been reported in PAH patients (Orte et al., 2000) . Increases in angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptors were both demonstrated in hypoxic and monocrotaline-treated pulmonary hypertensive rats (Chassagne et al., 2000; Ferreira et al., 2009 ). In the RAS, ACE plays a central role in generating Ang II from angiotensin I (Ang I) (Turner & Hooper, 2002) , and Ang II exerts a prominent role in the development of pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH (Jeffery & Wanstall, 2001) , particularly in promoting the growth of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) via AT1 receptors (Morrell et al., 1999) . Moreover, medication with either ACE inhibitor or AT1 receptor antagonist can attenuate pulmonary arterial remodeling and PAH in Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 245 (2010) [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] chronic hypoxia or monocrotaline-treated rats (Nong et al., 1996; Kishi et al., 2006) . Additionally, nicotine, an important component of cigarette smoke, and its metabolites can increase both the activity and the expression of ACE in cultured human endothelial cells (Saijonmaa et al., 2005; Ljungberg & Persson, 2008) . Furthermore, inhibition of ACE may improve endothelial function in chronic cigarette smokers (Butler et al., 2001) . Based on these previous findings, we hypothesized that activated RAS might also contribute to the development of chronic smoking-induced PAH.\r\n Losartan, a specific AT1 receptor blocker, exerts its influence on the RAS via inhibiting the stimulation of the AT1 receptor by Ang II. It has been reported that losartan treatment may attenuate pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH in hypoxic rats and in piglets with left-to-right shunts (Chassagne et al., 2000; Rondelet et al., 2005) . However, it has not been determined whether losartan has a therapeutic effect on chronic cigarette smoking-induced PAH. In addition, losartan has shown a modulatory effect on the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in hypertensive and cardiovascular diseases (Ishiyama et al., 2004; Koka et al., 2008) . ACE2, with a main role in cleaving Ang II into angiotensin (1-7) [Ang (1-7)] (Ferrario et al., 2005b) , is a recently found regulator of the RAS and has been implicated in multiple lung diseases, e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis and monocrotalineinduced PAH Kuba et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008; Ferreira et al., 2009 ). However, it has not been elucidated whether ACE2 has a role in chronic smoking-induced PAH. A recent study shows that the antihypertensive action of AT1 antagonists may be partially due to increased Ang II metabolism by ACE2 (Ferrario et al., 2005a) . Thus, in the present study, we sought to investigate whether losartan is therapeutically useful in smoke-induced pulmonary arterial remodeling and PAH and the possible participation of ACE2 in the mechanism.\r\n Animals. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 200 to 250 g (supplied by Experimental Animal Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University) were used. All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan University (Chengdu, China).\r\n Experimental design. Rats were exposed to the whole smoke of 15 commercial, nonfilter cigarettes (Five Oxen, Chengdu Cigarette Factor, China, per cigarette contains nicotine 1 mg and tar 14 mg) in ventilated whole-body smoking chambers (70 cm\u00d7 50 cm \u00d7 50 cm) for 30 minutes each time, twice per day for up to 6 months as previously described ) with minor modifications. The smoke total particulate matter (TPM) concentration inside the exposure chambers was 250 \u00b1 26 mg\/m 3 , determined by gravimetric analysis of filters at the exhaust port for the duration of the exposure. The control groups were exposed to fresh air under similar conditions. All rats were treated once a day, by oral gavage, with either saline or 10 mg\/kg losartan or 30 mg\/kg losartan 0.5 hour before the first smoke exposure each day.\r\n Hemodynamic analysis. After an observation of 6 months, rats were anaesthetized with pentobarbitone (50 mg\/kg i.p.) and were placed in a supine position, breathing room air. The right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was measured as previously described (Ferreira et al., 2009) . The cannula, filled with heparin-saline solution (50 U\/ml), was gently introduced through the right external jugular vein down to the right ventricle. The RVSP was recorded using a miniature liquid pressure transducer (Biopac System Inc., USA) and a computerized data acquisition system (MP150, Biopac System Inc., USA). Data was obtained from steady-state waveform for 5 minutes.\r\n Histological analysis and tissue preparation. After the RVSP measurement, all rats were killed by exanguination via external iliac artery and the lungs were harvested. The right lung was fixed in 4% polyformaldehyde (pH 7.4) overnight for paraffin embedding, sectioning, and histological staining. The left lung was dissected, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at \u221280\u00b0C for biochemical analysis.\r\n The paraffin sections (4 \u00b5m thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and van Gieson's elastic stain. Assessment of vascular morphology was carried out as previously described (Kishi et al., 2006) . Briefly, the medial wall thickness (MWT) in fully muscularized arteries with an external diameter of 50 to 100 \u00b5m was evaluated by calculating the percentage of medial wall thickness as (medial thickness \u00d7 2 \/ external diameter) \u00d7 100% along the shortest curvature. At least 10 muscular arteries per section were examined using Image Plus 5.0 System (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, USA) in a blinded fashion by a skilled investigator.\r\n For the immunohistochemical detection of ACE2, the sections were stained with anti-rat ACE2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). Images were acquired by an optical microscope (H600, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) fitted with a RT SPOT digital camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).\r\n Western blotting analysis of ACE2 and ACE in lung homogenates. Lung homogenates were prepared in lysis buffer, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mM NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and a protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, USA) as previously described ). The protein concentration in the lung homogenate was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Equivalent amounts of protein samples (30 \u00b5g) were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto 0.45 \u00b5M polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of ACE2 polyclonal antibody and a 1:1000 dilution of ACE polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA). Western blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\r\n Measurement of Ang II levels. Tissue Ang II levels were measured by iodine-125 radioimmunoassay (RIA) using the Ang II RIA kit (Beijing North Institute of Biological Technology, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions as previously described (Chen et al., 2002) . Briefly, lung tissue was washed with cold saline, minced and heated in 0.1 M HCl at 100\u00b0C for 10 minutes, and then homogenized. After centrifugation at 15,000 \u00d7 g for 30 minutes, the supernatant was lyophilized and redissolved in 400 \u03bcl assay buffer, and the radioactivity was measured by a \u03b3 counter.\r\n Measurement of ACE2 levels and cell proliferation in cultured primary pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells from control and smoke-exposed rats. Segments of pulmonary arteries were obtained from lungs of SD rats exposed to fresh air or cigarette smoke for 3 months or 6 months. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were isolated and cultured as previously described (Ogawa et al., 2005) with minor modifications. The arteries were excised and isolated, cut into small pieces and immersed in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1 mg of collagenase for 15 minutes. The endothelium and adventitia were gently removed. And the remainder of the vascular tissues was placed in culture plates. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U\/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin. And cell immunostaining was performed to confirm that cells were smooth muscle cells with anti-\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) monoclonal antibody (NeoMarkers, Lab Vision, Fremont, CA, USA). For the detection of ACE2 in PASMCs, cells were lysed in the lysis buffer as described above in the ACE2 and ACE assay in lung homogenates. Equivalent amounts of total protein (20 \u03bcg\/sample) were analyzed by Western blot with ACE2 antibody.\r\n Cell proliferation was assessed by [ 3 H]-thymidine incorporation as previously reported (Ogawa et al., 2005) . When PASMCs were cultured to reach to 90% confluence, cells were detached, seeded and grown for 16 hours at a first density of 10 \u00d7 10 5 cells\/ml. Subsequently, cells were incubated in low-serum culture media (DMEM, 0.1% FBS) to be kept quiescent for 24 hours. Then, DX600 (0.1 \u03bcM), an ACE2 inhibitor purchased from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (Belmont, CA, USA) was added to the culture media of the cells from cigarette smoke-exposed rats. In another 24 hours of incubation, cells were labeled with [ 3 H]-thymidine at 1 mCi\/ml for the last 3 hours. Then the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, 5% trichloroacetic acid, and 95% ethanol, followed by lysis in 0.5 M NaOH. Finally, aliquots of cell lysates were neutralized with HCl, and the radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation counter.\r\n Measurement of cell proliferation and ACE2 levels in cigarette smoke extract-challenged rat PASMCs. An extract of cigarette smoke in DMEM was prepared freshly for each experiment. Commercial, nonfilter cigarettes (the same cigarettes as used in Experimental design) were used. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was prepared as previously described (Oltmanns et al., 2005 ) with a few modifications. Briefly, cigarette smoke derived from one cigarette was drawn slowly into a 50-ml syringe and bubbled through 5 ml of DMEM. And one cigarette yielded 5 draws of 50 ml of the syringe, with each individual draw taking approximately 10 seconds to complete. The resulting solution, which represented \"100%\" strength, was then adjusted to pH 7.4 with concentrated NaOH and filtered before being diluted in DMEM to the required strength for application to PASMCs cultures.\r\n Cell growth was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo, Tokyo, Japan). PASMCs from control rats were plated in 96-well microplates at a first density of 2 \u00d7 10 4 cells\/ml per well. Before experiment, cells were incubated in low-serum culture media (DMEM, 0.1% FBS) to be kept quiescent for 24 hours. Then cells were left untreated or pretreated with 1 \u03bcM or 10 \u03bcM losartan for 30 minutes before exposure to 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, or 8% CSE for 24 hours, respectively. After addition of 10 \u03bcl of the CCK-8 reagent and 2 hours of incubation, the plates were read at 450 nm in a Model 680 microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA).\r\n All experiments were repeated at least three times, and each experimental condition was repeated at least in quintuplicate wells in each experiment. ACE2 levels were measured by Western blotting analysis as mentioned above.\r\n Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out using either Student's t test (for two-group comparison) or one-way ANOVA (for multiple-group comparison) followed by the least significant difference (LSD) test (SPSS for Windows version 13.0, Chicago, USA). A value of P b 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Values were expressed as means \u00b1 SD.\r\n To determine the effect of chronic cigarette smoking and losartan treatment on rat pulmonary arteries, we first examined the histopathology and hemodynamics of rat lungs. The percent medial wall thickness (%MWT) of pulmonary arteries, which is a marker of pulmonary arterial remodeling, was calculated. As presented in Figs. 1A and B, thick-walled pulmonary arteries with apparent medial hypertrophy were observed in smoke-exposed rats as compared to the normal pulmonary vascular structure in control rats. In addition, hemodynamic assessment shows a notable rise in RVSP after a 6month smoke exposure in rats (P b 0.05, Fig. 2 ). In contrast, medication with losartan apparently reduced the smoke-induced increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness and RVSP elevation, suggesting that losartan administration may attenuate pulmonary artery remodeling and PAH induced by chronic cigarette smoke exposure in rats.\r\n Ang II accumulation induced by cigarette smoke exposure and the effect of losartan treatment Activated RAS and increased Ang II levels have been detected in hypoxic and monocrotaline-treated pulmonary hypertensive rats (Chassagne et al., 2000; Ferreira et al., 2009) . To investigate whether Ang II accumulation also exists in smoke-induced PAH, we measured the Ang II concentration in rat lungs after a 6-month smoke exposure using RIA. As illustrated in Fig. 3 , chronic smoke exposure induced a marked increase in Ang II levels in the lung, which was significantly inhibited by losartan treatment (P b 0.05).\r\n To further examine the mechanism for Ang II accumulation in smoke-induced PAH in rats, we examined the ACE and ACE2 levels in smoke-exposed rats. Western blotting analysis for ACE and ACE2 protein expression and ACE2 immunohistochemical staining were performed. Immunohistochemistry results showed a notable decrease of ACE2 positive staining in lung sections in the smoke-exposed rats as compared to the control rats (Fig. 4A ). Densitometric analysis of Western blotting bands indicates that smoke exposure induced a significant elevation in ACE but a decrease in ACE2 levels in lung tissue (Figs. 4B and C). Losartan administration in rats significantly increased the abundance of the band identified by ACE2 antibody, while no significant difference was found in ACE expression between the smoke-exposed group and the group treated with smoke plus losartan. The results imply that losartan could partially reverse the smoke-induced ACE2 reduction but had no effect on ACE protein expression.\r\n To compare the expression levels of ACE2 in rat primary PASMCs from the smoke-exposed group and from the control group, cell lysis samples were used for Western blotting analysis. The results showed that ACE2 protein levels were significantly decreased in the PASMCs from the smoke-exposed rats (P b 0.05 vs Con), especially from the 6month exposed rats (Figs. 5A and B) , which was consistent with the findings of ACE2 expression in lung homogenates in our in vivo study.\r\n Enhanced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells has been reported in PAH patients (Yi et al., 2000) . Since PASMC proliferation is a major contributor and an important characteristic of PAH, rat primary PASMCs were isolated, and cell proliferation was evaluated by [ 3 H]-thymidine incorporation in vitro. As shown in Fig. 5C , the [ 3 H]-thymidine incorporation rates in PASMCs from the smoke-exposed rats, especially from 6-month exposed rats, were significantly higher than that from the control group, implying that smoke exposure may simulate PASMC proliferation in rat lungs. Furthermore, cells proliferated even more rapidly in the presence of DX600, an ACE2 inhibitor, implying a possible involvement of ACE2 in the proliferation of PASMCs. There was no significant difference in [ 3 H]-thymidine incorporation between the PASMCs from 3-month air-exposed rats and those from 6-month airexposed rats.\r\n To investigate the effect of CSE on cell proliferation of PASMCs in vitro, PASMCs from control rats were challenged with 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, or 8% CSE and cell proliferation was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 6A , CSE at concentrations of 0.5%, 1%, and 2% caused a significant increase in cell number compared with the control samples (P b 0.05), and the peak increase in PASMC viability was observed at a concentration of 2% CSE. In contrast, CSE at higher concentrations (N4%) appeared to be toxic to PASMC.\r\n Based on the cell proliferation results, the effects of losartan on cell proliferation and ACE2 expression in 2% CSE-challenged PASMCs were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 6B , 10 \u03bcM losartan pretreatment significantly inhibited 2% CSE-induced PASMC proliferation. In addition, 2% CSE also reduced ACE2 protein levels in PASMCs, which could be partially reversed by 10 \u03bcM losartan pretreatment (P b 0.05 vs. CSE; Figs. 6C and D) . These results were consistent with our findings in the in vivo study that losartan treatment may attenuate chronic smoking-induced pulmonary artery remodeling and ACE2 reduction in rat lungs.\r\n The present study mainly demonstrated that chronic cigarette smoke exposure significantly increased rat pulmonary arterial wall thickness and RVSP, along with an increase in Ang II and a decrease in ACE2 levels. Losartan treatment markedly reduced the pulmonary artery remodeling and RVSP elevation caused by cigarette smoke exposure and partially reversed the smoke-induced ACE2 decrease and Ang II elevation in rat lung. Consistent with our in vivo study results, in PASMCs from smoke-exposed rats, ACE2 levels were significantly lower than in those from the control rats in an exposure time-dependent manner. Moreover, PASMCs from 6-month exposed rats proliferated more rapidly than those from 3-month exposed or control rats, and cells grew even more rapidly by the ACE2 inhibition with DX600. In cultured PASMCs from control rats, in vitro CSE challenge could also stimulate cell proliferation and reduce ACE2 levels, which could be significantly inhibited by losartan pretreatment. Western blotting analysis for ACE2 in PASMCs from control rats (Con), 3-month smoke-exposed rats (SM, 3 month), and 6-month smoke-exposed rats (SM, 6 month) rats. Images are representative of three independent experiments. (B) Semiquantification of ACE2 levels by densitometry (ACE2\/\u03b2-actin ratio). (C) Measurement of cell proliferation rate by [ 3 H]-thymidine incorporation. Values are presented as mean counts per minute (cpm) of triplicate samples. DX600 (0.1 \u03bcM), an ACE2 inhibitor was added to the culture media of the cells from SM rats. Open bars: PASMCs from rats exposed to fresh air or cigarette smoke for three months (3 month); solid bars: PASMCs from rats exposed to fresh air or cigarette smoke for 6 months (6 month). \u204e P b 0.05, as compared with the Con group (3 month); # P b 0.05, as compared with the Con group (6 month); & P b 0.05, as compared with SM group (3 month); $ P b 0.05, as compared with the SM group (6 month). Thus, our results suggest that losartan may have a therapeutic role in the smoking-induced pulmonary artery remodeling and PAH, in which ACE2 may serve as part of the mechanism.\r\n It has been reported that guinea pigs exposed to cigarette smoke for 6 months produced an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and enhanced muscularization of small pulmonary arteries (Wright et al., 2003 . Similarly, elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure and increased muscularized pulmonary vessels have also been detected in rats after 16-week cigarette smoke exposure (Lee et al., 2005) . Consistent with these findings, in the present study, 6 months of smoke exposure induced a marked medial wall thickening in rat pulmonary arteries and significantly increased RVSP in rats. These results suggest that chronic cigarette smoking may directly lead to pulmonary artery remodeling and PAH.\r\n Recently, it has been found that both the expression and activity of ACE in human endothelial cells can be increased after the exposure to nicotine, an important component of cigarette smoke (Saijonmaa et al., 2005; Ljungberg & Persson, 2008) . Since ACE plays a key role in converting Ang I into Ang II in the RAS, we hypothesized that cigarette smoke exposure may increase Ang II production in vivo by activating the RAS. In the present study, we found a significant elevation in ACE expression and an almost two-fold increase in Ang II levels in the lungs from the PAH rats exposed to cigarette smoke for 6 months as compared to those from the control rats. Since Ang II is believed to play an important role in PAH via binding to AT1 receptors (Jeffery & Wanstall, 2001) , our results suggest that activated RAS may also be involved in the smoke-induced pulmonary artery remodeling and PAH.\r\n Losartan is a specific Ang II antagonist that directly blocks AngII at the AT1 receptor. Therapeutic effects of losartan on PAH in hypoxia rats and shunted piglets have been reported (Rondelet et al., 2005) . Our study showed that losartan treatment effectively suppressed pulmonary artery medial wall thickening and RVSP elevation in smoke-exposed rats as well as the CSE-induced cell proliferation in rat PASMCs. The inhibitory effect of losartan may be due to its property of directly blocking the AT1 receptor, which, as we speculate, might result in the accumulation of Ang II via an undetermined mechanism. But interestingly, in the rats treated with smoke exposure plus losartan administration, we observed a significant decrease in Ang II levels in the lung as compared to the rats exposed to smoke alone, implying the existence of additional potential mechanisms for losartan-attenuated PAH in the smokeinduced rat model. In other words, losartan can not only inhibit the effect of Ang II but may also decrease Ang II levels in cigarette smoking-induced PAH.\r\n In the RAS, ACE cleaves Ang I to generate the potent vasoconstrictor Ang II, whereas ACE2 hydrolyses Ang II to inactive Ang (1-7) and is a negative regulator of the system. In the present study, we found a significant decrease in ACE2 levels in the cigarette smoke-induced PAH rats and in the cultured CSE-challenged rat PASMCs, which could be partially restored by losartan treatment. On the contrary, losartan had no effect on the smoke-induced ACE elevation. In a previous study, Ferrario et al. (2005a) also found that losartan treatment (10 mg\/kg) showed no effect on plasma ACE activity in normotensive Lewis rats. Similarly, in another study in Wistar rats with experimental congestive heart failure (CHF), ACE activity in the myocardial homogenate did not differ between the treatment with and without eprosartan (another AT1 receptor antagonist) administration (Karram et al., 2005) . Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that losartan can efficiently increase both the expression and activity of ACE2 in rat heart or human kidney (Koka et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2009) . Increased ACE2 may augment the conversion of Ang II into Ang (1-7), leading to the decrease in Ang II concentration. Thus, these findings suggest that losartan treatment may have more influence on ACE2 than on ACE, and the reduction of Ang II in the attenuation of losartan-treated PAH is probably due to the losartan-induced elevation in ACE2 levels. As a result, the stimulation of the AT1 receptor in response to Ang II is reduced, which may also contribute to the attenuation of smokeinduced PAH by losartan treatment.\r\n There is now growing evidence to suggest that ACE2 may play an important part in PAH. It has been found that ACE2 plays a protective role but its expression is decreased in human and experimental pulmonary fibrosis (Li et al., 2008) . In a very recent study, chronic treatment with XNT, a synthetic activator of ACE2, prevented the elevation of RVSP, right ventricular hypertrophy, and thickness of pulmonary vessel wall in monocrotaline-induced PAH rat model (Ferreira et al., 2009 ). In our present study, we found that ACE2 protein expression was significantly decreased in the lung along with apparent pulmonary arterial remodeling and PAH in the 6-month smoke-exposed rats. Moreover, in our in vitro study, Western blotting results also showed that ACE2 was markedly decreased in the PASMCs from the smoke-exposed rats compared with those from the control rats. In addition, ACE2 inhibition with DX600 significantly increased PASMC proliferation rate above the level induced by smoke exposure alone, indicating a possible involvement of ACE2 in the smokeinduced growth of PASMCs. There is recent evidence that Ang II downregulates ACE2 via AT1 receptor-mediated ERK\/p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway (Koka et al., 2008) , therefore the decrease in ACE2 protein expression induced by chronic cigarette smoke exposure may be mediated by a mechanism dependent on Ang II and its receptors. The detailed mechanism itself warrants further study.\r\n In summary, chronic cigarette smoke exposure significantly induced pulmonary artery wall thickening, RVSP elevation, as well as Ang II accumulation and ACE2 decrease in rat lungs. Losartan administration effectively attenuated the smoke-induced pulmonary arterial remodeling and PAH, reduced Ang II elevation, and reversed ACE2 reduction. ACE2 inhibition with specific inhibitor in vitro further increased rat PASMC proliferation induced by smoke exposure. Similarly, losartan treatment significantly suppressed CSE-induced cell proliferation and ACE2 decrease in cultured rat primary PASMCs. These results suggest that losartan may attenuate the chronic smoking-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH in which ACE2 may serve as part of the mechanism. This study might provide insight into the development of new therapeutic interventions for PAH smokers.","sha":"52ef40cbfbd93f506eb4d57a15a7fac62a43e778","publish_time":"2010-05-15","authors":"Han, Su-Xia; He, Guang-Ming; Wang, Tao; Chen, Lei; Ning, Yun-Ye; Luo, Feng; An, Jin; Yang, Ting; Dong, Jia-Jia; Liao, Zeng-lin; Xu, Dan; Wen, Fu-Qiang","journal":"Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology","doi":"10.1016\/j.taap.2010.02.009","Title":"Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology","H index":153.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a group of diseases characterized by a progressive increase of pulmonary vascular resistance that finally cause right ventricular failure and premature death (Chaouat et al., However, it has not been determined whether losartan has a therapeutic effect on chronic cigarette smoking-induced PAH.

[1] [2] [3] PRRSV, equine arteritis virus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus, and lactate dehydrogenaseelevating virus are members of the family Arteriviridae. [4, 5] PRRSV is a positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA virus with a full-length genome of 15 kb that has a 5 cap and a 3 poly (A) tail. [4, [6] [7] [8] PRRSV was first reported in the United States in the late 1980s. [9] In 2006, several large-scale, severe outbreaks of highly pathogenic (HP) atypical PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) were reported in China and neighboring Asian countries. [2, 3, 10] Reported HP-PRRSV morbidity and mortality rates were much higher than previous pandemic PRRSV strains and associated with more severe clinical presentations and higher rectal temperature (>41\u00b0C). [11] The emergence of HP-PRRSV has caused great economic loss to the swine industry in China and made preventing and controlling PRRSV outbreaks difficult. Therefore, elucidating the causes of the greater virulence of PRRSV and the differences between the HP and attenuated pathogenic (AP) strains has become even more important. To this end, several trials have been conducted to identify virulence factors; these studies have resulted in some successes. [12, 13] However, changes in virulence and pathogenic mechanisms are difficult to discern. Other than virulence in vivo, many distinctions in the biological aspects of HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV have been noted, such as in viral binding and entry into pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). PRRSV exhibits highly restricted cell tropism both in vivo and in vitro. [14] The virus can be detected only in well-differentiated macrophages of lungs, lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, spleen, tonsils, and thymus. PAMs are the main target cells of PRRSV. [15] PRRSV can also replicate in vitro in the African www.advancedsciencenews.com www.proteomics-journal.com\r\n Membrane proteins (MPs) of PAMs infected by highly proteomic (HP)-and attenuated proteomic (AP)-PRRSV have been elucidated by LC-MS\/MS for label-free quantitative proteomics. Ninety-five differentially expressed proteins were identified and characterized. The most significant difference in the biological process between PAMs infected with HP-and AP-PRRSV is the metabolic process. Most different molecular functions were classified as binding and catalytic activities. Cellular component categories showed that 26 differentially expressed proteins were confirmed as MPs based on the annotation of UniProt database, such as RAP2A, VCL (Vinculin), IFITM3 function in cell-cell junctions, ERK signaling pathway, G protein signaling pathways, biotic stimulus, and so on. Among them, VCL is a kind of F-actin-binding protein which is involved in cell-matrix adhesion and cell-cell adhesion in humans. It was demonstrated that over expression of VCL could inhibit the replication of both HP-PRRSV and the attenuated PRRSV in the mRNA level. There were obvious differences in the inhibiting ability for HP-PRRSV and its attenuated strain. This is the first attempt to explore the differential characteristics between HP-PRRSV and its attenuated PRRSV-infected PAMs focusing on MPs which will be of great help to further understand the different infective mechanisms of HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV.\r\n green monkey kidney cell line MA-104 and its derivatives, MARC-145 and CL-2621, which are considered permissive cell lines for PRRSV. [16, 17] Reportedly, PRRSV targets cellular membrane proteins (MPs) and enters target cells through receptormediated endocytosis during viral infection. [18] Studies have investigated possible mechanisms employed by PRRSV to infect PAMs. [19] Elucidating the characteristics of viruses and interactions between viruses and host cells is increasingly important. However, exploring individual proteins within the many proteins in cells is difficult. Nonetheless, gradual advancements have come through use of proteomic techniques. Of these, MS-based quantitative proteomic techniques offer the advantage of better accuracy and sensitivity, and have been widely used to analyze host cell responses to viral infection. Among them, liquid chromatographytandem MS (LC-MS\/MS) for label-free quantitative proteomics (LFQP) is an important mass spectrometric tool to detect and quantify large amounts of proteins. [20] Compared with quantitative proteomics using stable isotope labeling such as stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, LFQP detects greater amounts of proteins and important signaling pathways and networks. The aim of this study was to determine potentially different infection mechanisms used by the HP strain vHuN4 [10] and its derivative attenuated strain vHuN4-F112 [21, 22] using LFQP.\r\n The animal study protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.\r\n HP-PRRSV strain vHuN4 [3, 10] at a titer of 10 5 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) mL \u22121 and cell-passaged attenuated virus strain vHuN4-F112 (AP-PRRSV) [21, 22] at a titer of 10 5 TCID 50 mL \u22121 were stored as viral stocks. Porcine circovirus 2, classical swine fever virus, PRRSV antibody, and antigen-free 15-day-old piglets were used. Animals were sacrificed in accordance with the ethics statement. Lungs were dissected and lavaged with PBS (PBS; Life Technologies, Inc., Gibco\/BRL Division, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 1% penicillinstreptomycin (Gibco\/BRL), then centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 g for 5 min, resuspended in PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS. PAMs were collected in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Gibco\/BRL) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco\/BRL) [23] and incubated in 10 cm dishes (Corning, Inc., Corning, NY, USA) for 12 h at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere.\r\n After PAMs were washed with PBS three times, dead and nonadherent cells were removed when confluency exceeded 95%. Three dishes were inoculated with vHuN4 and another three with vHuN4-F112 at multiplicity of infection 1. An additional three dishes were inoculated with DMEM (Gibco-BRL) as a blank control. All dishes were incubated at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 , as described previously. [13] After incubation for 1 h, inocula were discarded and PAMs were washed with PBS three times. Cell monolayers in all dishes were overlaid with RPMI-1640 medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere for 24 h.\r\n PAMs were digested with 2 mL 0.25% trypsinethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution (Gibco\/BRL), collected by gently pipetting, centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 g for 5 min and lysed using the ProteoExtract Transmembrane Protein Extraction Kits (NOVAGEN, EMD Biosciences, Inc., Madison, WI, USA), [24, 25] according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were resuspended in Extraction Buffer 1 and protease inhibitor cocktail, incubated for 10 min at 4\u00b0C with gentle agitation, and centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. After removing supernatants, pellets were resuspended in 0.2 mL Extraction Buffer 2A and protease inhibition cocktail, incubated for 45 min at room temperature with gentle agitation, and centrifuged at www.advancedsciencenews.com www.proteomics-journal.com 16 000 \u00d7 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were precipitated with 1 mL acetone and centrifuged at 12 000 \u00d7 g for 10 min. After evaporating to dryness, 150 \u03bcL SDT buffer (4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 100 mm Tris\/HCl at pH 7.6, 0.1 m dithiothreitol) was added and mixtures were heated in boiling water for 5 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were collected and quantified with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, USA). Fig. 1 \r\n Digestion of protein (250 \u03bcg for each sample) was performed according to the FASP (Filter-Aided Sample Preparation) procedure. Briefly, the detergent, DTT and other low-molecular-weight components were removed using 200 \u03bcL UA buffer (8 m Urea, 150 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by repeated ultrafiltration (Microcon units, 10 kD) facilitated by centrifugation. Then 100 \u03bcL 0.05 m iodoacetamide in UA buffer was added to block reduced cysteine residues and the samples were incubated for 20 min in darkness. The filter was washed with 100 \u03bcL UA buffer three times and then 100 \u03bcL 25 mm NH 4 HCO 3 twice. Finally, the protein suspension was digested with 3 \u03bcg trypsin (Promega) in 40 \u03bcL 25 mm NH 4 HCO 3 overnight at 37\u00b0C, and the resulting peptides were collected as a filtrate. The peptide content was estimated by UV light spectral density at 280 nm using an extinctions coefficient of 1.1 of 0.1% (g L \u22121 ) solution that was calculated on the basis of the frequency of tryptophan and tyrosine in vertebrate proteins. [26] \r\n The peptide of each sample was desalted on C18 Cartridges (Empore SPE Cartridges C18 (standard density), bed id 7 mm, volume 3 mL, Sigma), then concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in 40 \u03bcL of 0.1% (v\/v) trifluoroacetic acid. MS experiments were performed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer that was coupled to Easy nLC (Proxeon Biosystems, now Thermo Fisher Scientific). Five microgram peptide was loaded onto a C18-reversed phase column (Thermo Scientific Easy Column, 10 cm long, 75 \u03bcm inner diameter, 3 \u03bcm resin) in buffer A (2% acetonitrile and 0.1% Formic acid) and separated with a linear gradient of buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% Formic acid) at a flow rate of 250 nL min \u22121 controlled by IntelliFlow technology over 120 min. MS data was acquired using a datadependent top ten method dynamically choosing the most abundant precursor ions from the survey scan (300-1800 m\/z) for HCD fragmentation. Determination of the target value is based on predictive automatic gain control. Dynamic exclusion duration was 25 s. Survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 70 000 at m\/z 200 and resolution for HCD spectra was set to 17 500 at m\/z 200. Normalized collision energy was 30 eV and the underfill ratio, which specifies the minimum percentage of the target value likely to be reached at maximum fill time, was defined as 0.1%. The instrument was run with peptide recognition mode enabled. MS experiments were performed triply for each sample. [27] \r\n The MS data were analyzed using MaxQuant software version 1.3.0.5. MS data were searched against the uniprot Sus scrofa sequence database (including 34 253 sequences downloaded on 12\/27\/2014). An initial search was set at a precursor mass window of 6 ppm. The search followed an enzymatic cleavage rule of Trypsin\/P and allowed maximal two missed cleavage sites and a mass tolerance of 20 ppm for fragment ions. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was defined as fixed modification, while protein N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were defined as variable modifications for database searching. The cutoff of global false discovery rate for peptide and protein identification was set to 0.01. Label-free quantification was carried out in MaxQuant as previously described. Protein abundance was calculated on the basis of the normalized spectral protein intensity (LFQ intensity).\r\n All statistical analyses were performed using unpaired t-tests. A p-value <0.05 and ratio >2 or <0.5 were considered to indicate significant differences. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and functional classification of identified proteins was with Blast2GO ver. V2.6.2 with the current public database b2g_aug 12 (www.Blast2go.com). Identified proteins were classified www.advancedsciencenews.com www.proteomics-journal.com using Blast2go steps under default parameters: blast, mapping, and annotation. Protein-protein interaction networks were analyzed using (String software string-db.org\/) . Confidence view was assigned a score of 0.4, indicating medium confidence.\r\n Samples of PRRSV-infected and DMEM-inoculated PAMs were lysed at 24 h post infection and protein concentrations were determined. Samples (20 \u03bcg) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to 0.22 \u03bcm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with monoclonal antibodies against heat shock protein 70 (HSP70; ab5439; Abcam plc, Cambridge, UK) or KDEL receptor (ab69659; Abcam plc). After washing three times, membranes were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or antirabbit IgG (Abcam plc). Detection used chemiluminescence luminal reagents (Pierce Biotechnology, Waltham, MA, USA).\r\n The porcine vinculin (VCL) were amplified from the cDNA obtained from PAM cells. Restriction enzyme sites were incorporated into the primer sequences to facilitate molecular cloning. PCR products were cloned into the pCAGGS vector to produce the porcine VCL expression vector. For transfection, cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Corning) and transfected at 70-80% confluency with respective constructed plasmids DNA by using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The HP-HuN4 or HuN4-F112 was infected in MARC-145 cells at 36 h post transfection. Empty vector transfection samples served as controls in the experiment.\r\n At 48 h post infection, total RNAs of PRRSV-infected cells were extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), the viral RNAs in supernatants were isolated using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen), according to the instruction manual. All the isolated RNAs were used as the template for synthesis of firststrand cDNA by RT-PCR using RT primed by oligo (dT) 18 primer using the PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Perfect Real Time, TaKaRa), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then the cDNA templates were quantified using PRRSV-specific real-time RT-qPCR. [28] 3. Results\r\n A total of 2849 proteins were detected by LFQP and are displayed in a heatmap (Figure 2) . Statistical significance was determined using unpaired t-tests. For all tests, a p-value of <0.05 and ratio of >2 or <0.5 was considered to indicate a significant difference. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was the internal normalization control and the ratio of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase between HP and AP-PRRSV was 0.95 \u00b1 0.55. The \"only one exists\" group indicated that proteins were detected only in one group but not another group due to low expression level ( Table 1) . Correlation analysis indicated good repeatability of the technology (Figure 3) .\r\n A total of 95 differentially expressed proteins were identified ( Table 2) . A control group was used to exclude false-positive interference. Data from the control group was also used to elucidate functions of target proteins. Differentially expressed proteins between control and HP-PRRSV-infected cells (Con\/HP) and the www.advancedsciencenews.com www.proteomics-journal.com p <0.01 and ratio >2 or <0.5 indicated quantitative difference between two groups. The \"only one exits\" group indicated that proteins were detected three times in one, but not in the other group. HP-PRRSV group means proteins identified in the HP-PRRSV infected PAMs, while AP-PRRSV was proteins detected in the attenuated pathogenic PRRSV infected PAMs. Control was displayed as the mock.\r\n control and AP-PRRSV-infected cells (Con\/AP) are in Supporting Information.\r\n To extend the molecular characterization of quantitative differences and only-one-exists groups, UniProt and GO databases were used to characterize information about biological processes (BPs), molecular functions (MF), and cellular components (CC).\r\n BPs of H (vH\/vA >2, including 41 proteins) and A (vH\/vA < 0.5, including 54 proteins) groups are in Figures 4A and B BP. In group H, GO annotations were primarily distributed in response to stimulus (70.7%), metabolic process (68.3%), and immune system process (43.9%). Ratios were 63.0% response to stimulus, 90.7% metabolic process, and 33.3% immune system process in group A. The most significant difference in BP between PAMs infected with HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV was seen for metabolic process, which may be the major reason for the large differences among animals challenged with different virulence of PRRSV. Molecular function categories of H group and A group were shown in Figure 4A ,B MF. Most different molecular functions were classified as binding (87.8 and 90.7%) and catalytic activity (31.7 and 44.4%). Binding of H group included enzyme binding (31.7%), nucleic acid binding (31.7%) and protein complex binding (26.8%), while group A mainly involved nucleic acid binding (31.5%), nucleoside phosphate binding (27.8%) and nucleotide binding (27.8%) from the analysis of GO distribution by level 4. Enzyme code distribution suggested there were five transferases (12.2%), one hydrolase (2.4%), one lyase (2.4%), and two ligases (4.9%) detected in group H. while four oxidoreductases (1.9%), five transferases (9.3%), five hydrolases (9.3%), three lyases (5.6%), and three isomerases (5.6%) in group A.\r\n CC categories were illustrated in Figure 4A B CC. Ninety-five detected differentially expressed proteins were annotated and categorized to CCs of macromolecular complex (58.9%), membrane (57.9%), membrane-enclosed lumen (57.9%), and extracellular region (44.2%). Because of technological problems, we were unable to conclude that all the detected proteins were indeed MPs. However, 26 were confirmed based on the annotation of UniProt database and there also existed proteins partially anchored on the membrane or binding with the MPs.\r\n To verify the differentially expressed proteins via LC-MS\/MS for LFQP, Western blots were conducted for two proteins partially located on membranes. Expression of HSP70 and the KDEL receptor from cell lysates of vHuN4-infected and vHuN4-F112-infected PAMs, and DMEM-inoculated PAMs were tested with antibodies to the proteins. LFQP showed that the ratios between vHuN4infected and vHuN4-F112-infected PAMs reached 0.67 and 0.51, respectively. Western blots confirmed LFQP results ( Figure 5 ).\r\n To examine whether the differentially expressed proteins detected affects virus infection, the VCL transient overexpression vector was transfected into MARC-145 cells, followed by the HP HuN4 or its attenuated strain infection. The PRRSV-specific RT-qPCR results showed that VCL protein could inhibit both viruses, especially for HP-HuN4 strain. Compared with the empty vector \r\n In this study, LFQP of MPs of HP-PRRSV-, AP-PRRSV-infected PAMs and the control was performed. Important information about target proteins related to virus infection was obtained. The HP-PRRSV strain vHuN4 and its derivative, the serially cellpassaged attenuated strain vHuN4-F112, [29] revealed different infection mechanisms in PAMs. A total of 2849 proteins were identified among the control, AP-PRRSV-infected, and HP-PRRSV-infected PAMs. Of these, 2400 were detected in all three groups (Figure 7) . We focused on 95 differentially expressed proteins of AP-PRRSV-and HP-PRRSV-infected PAMs; among these, 43 were detected in only one group.\r\n PRRSV has been a threat to the global pig economy for several years because of its persistent infection, immune escape, and high mortality from inflammation and high fever. [30] The attenuated PRRSV vHuN4-F112 vaccine strain attenuated from HP-PRRSV vHuN4 by serial passages, which is now used in China. [31] We analyzed MPs to identify factors associated with immunological effects and determine differences between HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV. MPs classified based on GO analysis are in Table 3 .\r\n A heatmap based on the UniProt database was constructed to comprehend the functions and BPs of differently expressed proteins ( Figure 8B) , which revealed clustering and abundance of the 26 detected proteins that existed confidentially on the membrane based on UniProt database annotation. We first focused on proteins associated with immunology and inflammation with higher abundance in AP-PRRSV-infected PAMs. PTPN2 (vH\/vA = 0.419), a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family, functions as signaling molecule that regulates cellular processes related to the Jak-STAT, IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling pathways; dephosphorylation of nonreceptor kinases including JAK1, JAK3, STAT3, and STAT6; and negative regulation of IL-2-, IL-4, IL-6, and IFN-mediated signaling. PTPN2 also functions in the response to inflammation via NF-\u03baB. [32] [33] [34] SIPA1 (H-\/A+) is a mitogen-induced GT-Pase activating protein for Ras-related regulatory proteins. It was related to G-protein signaling and blood-brain barrier and immune cell transmigration: VCAM01\/CD106 (cluster of differentiation) signaling pathways. [35, 36] C5AR1 (H-\/A+) is the receptor for the chemotactic and inflammatory peptide anaphylatoxin C5a, which stimulates chemotaxis, granule enzyme release, intracellular calcium release, and superoxide anion production, participates in the innate and adaptive immune responses to www.advancedsciencenews.com www.proteomics-journal.com Table 3 . Statistics analysis of proteins that existed definitely on the membrane. the lectin-induced complement pathway. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] Polyribonucleotide 5 -hydroxyl-kinase Clp1 (CLP1) (vH\/vA = 0.136) mainly acts as a kinase that binds ATP hosting 5 -hydroxyl-kinase activity, and functions in mRNA cleavage and in siRNA loading onto the RNAinduced silencing complex involved in RNA interference and its destruction. The kinase hClp1 phosphorylates and licenses synthetic siRNAs to assemble into an RNA-induced silencing complex for cleavage of target RNA. [43] Expression of these molecules was higher in the AP-PRRSV-infected group and had a similar level to the control group. Therefore, we concluded that they might be related to the immune escape of HP-PRRSV and that the attenuated vaccine strain would not have side effects on these immune factors expression in the host cell, and these proteins above would contribute to the resistance of PRRSV. Some proteins related to immunology and inflammation had higher expression in HP-PRRSV-infected cells. Raftlin (vH\/vA = 2.554) protein is pivotal for maintenance of lipid rafts and may be involved in regulation of B-cell antigen receptor-mediated signaling. Raftlin promotes binding of double-stranded RNA, activations of B cell receptors and toll-like receptor 3 signaling pathways, and is involved in IL-17 production to release proinflammatory cytokines. Hence, the higher abundance of raftlin in the HP-PRRSV group compared to the AP-PRRSV and control groups may explain the more severe inflammation triggered by HP-PRRSV. [44, 45] IARS (H+\/A-), Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase is a target of autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases. [46, 47] VCL (H+\/A-), Vinculin is a cytoskeletal protein associated with cellcell and cell-matrix junctions, and is related to the IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF signaling pathways. [48] RAP2A (H+\/A-) is a member of the Ras oncogene family, small GTP-binding protein, of which active form interacts with several effectors [49] [50] [51] related to the ERK and G protein signaling pathways. [52, 53] It was reported that PRRSV could induces prostaglandin E2 production through cyclooxygenase 1 and is related to ERK signaling. [54] The differential expression of RAP2A may provide information for future research on the interaction between PRRSV and the ERK signaling pathway. The abundance of RAP2A was lower in AP-PRRSV-infected PAMs than in HP-PRRSV-infected PAMs and control cells, which had similar levels. Thus, we hypothesized that RAP2A was associated with immunization with the attenuated vaccine. IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3, IFITM3 (vH\/vA = 2.861), responds to biotic stimulus and had the highest expression levels among these proteins in the HP-PRRSV group, as compared to the proteins identified in the AP-PRRSV group but it was not detected in the control group. In humans, this protein negatively regulates the entry of multiple viruses, including influenza A virus, SARS coronavirus, Marburg virus (MARV), Ebola virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus (WNV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), into host cells. [55, 56] It could inhibit hemagglutinin protein -mediated entry of influenza virus, GP1, two-mediated viral entry of Marburg virus and Ebola virus, S protein-mediated viral entry of SARS coronavirus, and G protein-mediated viral entry of VSV, thereby playing a critical role in the structural stability and function of vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase). Establishing physical contact with the v-ATPase of endosomes is critical for proper clathrin localization and is required for v-ATPase to lower the pH in phagocytic endosomes, thus establishing an antiviral state. [57] High expression of both HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV suggests that IFITM3 may help inhibit PRRSV entry and promote resistance to HP-PRRSV infection. Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB, vH\/vA = 0.406) has peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity and is involved in protein folding and protein peptidyl-prolyl isomerization, which can accelerate protein folding. [58] PPIB is positively regulated by viral genome replication, is involved with the viral processes of hepatitis C virus (HCV), and interacts with and stimulates the RNA-binding activity of HCV NS5B. PPIB is critical for efficient replication of the HCV genome. [59] Compared with the control group, PPIB was downregulated in the HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV groups. The abundance of PPIB was lower in the HP-PRRSV group than the AP-PRRSV group, suggesting an association with PRRSV replication.\r\n String network analysis was used to elucidate interactions among differentially expressed proteins. The essential factors and receptors involved in the entry of PRRSV are reportedly CD163 (Q2VL90), nmHC II-A (MYH9, F1SKJ1), sialoadhesin (SN, A7LCJ3), CD151 (F1RYZ1), and vimentin (VIM) (P02543). [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] We assessed the involvement of these MPs together with proteins detected by string analysis on viral entry. Receptor proteins involved in PRRSV entry are in Figure 9 To better understand the characteristics of pathway-like regions, the GenomRNAi database was analyzed to annotate detected proteins. [66] Regions containing proteins with higher abundance in HP-PRRSV-infected PAMs are green and in AP-PRRSV-infected PAMs are red ( Figure 9A) . A search of the GenomRNAi database determined that linked proteins IK (IK cytokine), WD repeat domain 12, dyskerin pseudouridine synthase 1, and adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) in the green region of Figure 9A shared similar annotations and functioned to decrease expression of NF-\u03baB or IL-8, [67] which are related to inflammation. [44, 45] Hence, further analysis of these linked proteins may help explain differential mechanisms between HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV infection. Other proteins in the green-colored region of 9A are reported to influence virus infection. Nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 increases Sindbis virus infection [68] and ADSL increases human papilloma virus 16-GFP infection. [69] The lower abundance of nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein and ADSL in the HP-PRRSV-infected group may be related to the host immune response repression of PRRSV and may be used by HP-PRRSV during infection to self-upregulate. The red region of Figure 9A contains some linked proteins with some Figure 9 . Protein-protein interaction network determined by String software showing interactions among differentially expressed proteins between two virulent groups with CD163, VIM, and MYH9 added. Red, protein abundance higher in HP-PRRSV than AP-PRRSV; green, protein abundance in HP-PRRSV lower than in AP-PRRSV. Line colors represent type of evidence for association: green, neighborhood; red, fusion; purple, experimental; light blue, database; black, expression; blue, co-occurrence; yellow, text mining. Gene abbreviations are shown. vH, protein abundance in HP-PRRSV; vA protein abundance in AP-PRRSV. vH\/vA = 0, detected only in AP-PRRSV; vH\/vA = null, detected only in HP-PRRSV.\r\n information. Uridine monophosphate synthetase decreases HIV-1 infection, [70] while programmed cell death 5 decreases HCV replication, [71] both downregulate NF-\u03baB expression. [67] The lower abundance of these proteins in the HP-PRRSV group suggested that HP-PRRSV escaped inhibition through an unknown mechanism. Myosin-9 (MYH9) appears to function in cytokinesis, cell shape, and specialized functions such as secretion and capping. [72] MYH9 is an important factor for PRRSV infection and interacts with GP5 of PRRSV, [65] although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear because of limited research. As shown by our results, MYH9 was related to VCL in AP-PRRSV and ACTL6 in HP-PRRSV. VCL is an actin filament (F-actin)binding protein involved in cell-matrix adhesion and cell-cell adhesion in humans, regulation of cell-surface E-cadherin expression, and potentiation of mechanosensing, and may be important in cell morphology and locomotion by promoting binding with actin, alpha-catenin, cadherin, dystroglycan, and ubiquitin protein ligase. [73] In HIV research, transient overexpression of VCL reduced the susceptibility of human cells to infection with HIV-1 and negatively affected paxillin phosphorylation and limited retroviral infection. [74] Just like HIV-1, in our study, it was demonstrated that over expression of VCL could inhibit the replication of both HP-PRRSV and the attenuated PRRSV in the mRNA level. There were obvious differences in the inhibiting ability for HP-PRRSV and its attenuated strain. ACTL6A, which is an actin-like protein 6A, is involved in transcriptional www.advancedsciencenews.com www.proteomics-journal.com activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA-nucleosome topology) and mainly functions in chromatin binding and transcription coactivator activities. [75] We found that MYH9 may regulate AP-PRRSV and HP-PRRSV infection via different pathways. Through Super Pathways annotation (www.genecards.org), VCL and ACTL6A were identified as participants in the IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF, and TNF-\u03b1\/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, where they may help with differential mechanisms of PRRSV infection with different virulence.\r\n Using the GenomRNAi database, some linked proteins were found to be related to viruses or inflammation ( Figure 9B ). In the green region, GNAS complex locus (GNAS) increased human papilloma virus 16-GFP, [69] and serine\/arginine repetitive matrix 2 decreased HCV infection, influenza A replication and viral numbers, and IL-8 expression, [76, 77] Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U1 subunit 70 decreased influenza A replication and viral numbers. [77] IRF-3 decreased infection by HCV, West Nile virus, and Dengue virus. [76, 78] In the red region, HSF1 decreased HCV replication. [76] protein kinase CAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha decreased VSV infection. [79] Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 decreased IL-8 expression. RAP2A, MINK1, and GNAS are regulatory proteins in the RAS pathway. RAP2A and MINK1 were detected only in the HP-PRRSV group, whereas GNAS was detected only in the AP-PRRSV group, in accordance with a previous report that stimulation of RAS increases the replication ability of HCV by reducing IFN-JAK-STAT pathway activity. [80] We proposed that PRRSV was also related to the RAS pathway, and differed between HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV.\r\n CREB-binding protein (CREBBP) is composed of doublestranded RNA-activated transcription factor with IRF-3, and double-stranded RNA-activated transcription factor is activated in many virus-infected cells to promote apoptosis. [81, 82] CREBBP may interact with human herpes virus 8 vIRF-1, which could inhibit the binding of CREBBP to IRF-3. [83] Our results showed that IRF-3 abundance was tenfold lower in the HP-PRRSV than the AP-PRRSV group, which we proposed was a protective mechanism of PRRSV to escape from host immunity and ensure survival after viral infection. The ability of HP-PRRSV HuN4 to induce cell apoptosis is stronger than classical PRRSV (CH-1a) in immune organs and lungs of piglets. [84] We concluded that HP-PRRSV might interact with CREBBP and decrease IRF-3 expression to escape from host immunity and cause severe damage to the cell, highlighting a difference from AP-PRRSV.\r\n Notable differences exist during the infection of AP-PRRSV and HP-PRRSV. HP-PRRSV could inhibit host immune function and evade the immune response via unknown mechanism. [85, 86] Label-free MS was performed using AP-PRRSV-infected and HP-PRRSV-infected PAMs. This is the first attempt to explore the differential characteristics between HP-PRRSV and its attenuated PRRSV infected PAMs focusing on membrane proteins. By analyzing detected proteins in HP-infected, AP-PRRSV-infected, and control group, proteins related to the immune response or virus replication were identified that may elucidate unique pathways used by different virulent PRRSVs for cell entry, virus replication, and immune escape mechanisms. Researches on these detected proteins will help with the elucidation of the identity, the expression abundance, and significance of them, future study will be focused on functions of these key membrane proteins to deepen our understanding of differential mechanisms between HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV infection.","sha":"67b6aa7293bbb9a8fed752ae0e96553f4f5c44aa","publish_time":"2017-11-24","authors":"Qu, Zehui; Gao, Fei; Li, Liwei; Zhang, Yujiao; Jiang, Yifeng; Yu, Lingxue; Zhou, Yanjun; Zheng, Hao; Tong, Wu; Li, Guoxin; Tong, Guangzhi","journal":"Proteomics","doi":"10.1002\/pmic.201700101","Title":"Proteomics","H index":153.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been a leading economically significant viral pathogen of swine worldwide for almost 28 years. [ 11] The emergence of HP-PRRSV has caused great economic loss to the swine industry in China and made preventing and controlling PRRSV outbreaks difficult. Ninety-five differentially expressed proteins were identified and characterized. Most different molecular functions were classified as binding and catalytic activities. There were obvious differences in the inhibiting ability for HP-PRRSV and its attenuated strain. Nonetheless, gradual advancements have come through use of proteomic techniques. Among them, liquid chromatographytandem MS (LC-MS\/MS) for label-free quantitative proteomics (LFQP) is an important mass spectrometric tool to detect and quantify large amounts of proteins. [ HP-PRRSV strain vHuN4 [3, 10] at a titer of 10 5 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) mL \u22121 and cell-passaged attenuated virus strain vHuN4-F112 (AP-PRRSV) [21, 22] at a titer of 10 5 TCID 50 mL \u22121 were stored as viral stocks. Animals were sacrificed in accordance with the ethics statement. After PAMs were washed with PBS three times, dead and nonadherent cells were removed when confluency exceeded 95%. Cell monolayers in all dishes were overlaid with RPMI-1640 medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere for 24 h.\r\n PAMs were digested with 2 mL 0.25% trypsinethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution (Gibco\/BRL), collected by gently pipetting, centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 g for 5 min and lysed using the ProteoExtract Transmembrane Protein Extraction Kits (NOVAGEN, EMD Biosciences, Inc., Madison, WI, USA), [24, 25] according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 \r\n Digestion of protein (250 \u03bcg for each sample) was performed according to the FASP (Filter-Aided Sample Preparation) procedure. Finally, the protein suspension was digested with 3 \u03bcg trypsin (Promega) in 40 \u03bcL 25 mm NH 4 HCO 3 overnight at 37\u00b0C, and the resulting peptides were collected as a filtrate. The peptide content was estimated by UV light spectral density at 280 nm using an extinctions coefficient of 1.1 of 0.1% (g L \u22121 ) solution that was calculated on the basis of the frequency of tryptophan and tyrosine in vertebrate proteins. [ MS experiments were performed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer that was coupled to Easy nLC (Proxeon Biosystems, now Thermo Fisher Scientific). Dynamic exclusion duration was 25 s. Survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 70 000 at m\/z 200 and resolution for HCD spectra was set to 17 500 at m\/z 200. The instrument was run with peptide recognition mode enabled. MS experiments were performed triply for each sample. [ Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was defined as fixed modification, while protein N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were defined as variable modifications for database searching. The cutoff of global false discovery rate for peptide and protein identification was set to 0.01. All statistical analyses were performed using unpaired t-tests. A p-value <0.05 and ratio >2 or <0.5 were considered to indicate significant differences. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and functional classification of identified proteins was with Blast2GO ver. V2.6.2 with the current public database b2g_aug 12 (www.Blast2go.com). Confidence view was assigned a score of 0.4, indicating medium confidence. Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with monoclonal antibodies against heat shock protein 70 (HSP70; ab5439; Abcam plc, Cambridge, UK) or KDEL receptor (ab69659; Abcam plc). The porcine vinculin (VCL) were amplified from the cDNA obtained from PAM cells. Restriction enzyme sites were incorporated into the primer sequences to facilitate molecular cloning. Empty vector transfection samples served as controls in the experiment. All the isolated RNAs were used as the template for synthesis of firststrand cDNA by RT-PCR using RT primed by oligo (dT) 18 primer using the PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Perfect Real Time, TaKaRa), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results\r\n A total of 2849 proteins were detected by LFQP and are displayed in a heatmap (Figure 2) . A control group was used to exclude false-positive interference. Differentially expressed proteins between control and HP-PRRSV-infected cells (Con\/HP) and the www.advancedsciencenews.com www.proteomics-journal.com p <0.01 and ratio >2 or <0.5 indicated quantitative difference between two groups. Molecular function categories of H group and A group were shown in Figure 4A ,B MF. Binding of H group included enzyme binding (31.7%), nucleic acid binding (31.7%) and protein complex binding (26.8%), while group A mainly involved nucleic acid binding (31.5%), nucleoside phosphate binding (27.8%) and nucleotide binding (27.8%) from the analysis of GO distribution by level 4. Because of technological problems, we were unable to conclude that all the detected proteins were indeed MPs. However, 26 were confirmed based on the annotation of UniProt database and there also existed proteins partially anchored on the membrane or binding with the MPs. Western blots confirmed LFQP results ( Figure 5 ). A total of 2849 proteins were identified among the control, AP-PRRSV-infected, and HP-PRRSV-infected PAMs. 31] We analyzed MPs to identify factors associated with immunological effects and determine differences between HP-PRRSV and AP-PRRSV. MPs classified based on GO analysis are in Table 3 . 46, 47] VCL (H+\/A-), Vinculin is a cytoskeletal protein associated with cellcell and cell-matrix junctions, and is related to the IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF signaling pathways. [ 48] RAP2A (H+\/A-) is a member of the Ras oncogene family, small GTP-binding protein, of which active form interacts with several effectors [49] [50] [51] related to the ERK and G protein signaling pathways. [ Thus, we hypothesized that RAP2A was associated with immunization with the attenuated vaccine. IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3, IFITM3 (vH\/vA = 2.861), responds to biotic stimulus and had the highest expression levels among these proteins in the HP-PRRSV group, as compared to the proteins identified in the AP-PRRSV group but it was not detected in the control group. Establishing physical contact with the v-ATPase of endosomes is critical for proper clathrin localization and is required for v-ATPase to lower the pH in phagocytic endosomes, thus establishing an antiviral state.

Through Super Pathways annotation (www.genecards.org), VCL and ACTL6A were identified as participants in the IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF, and TNF-\u03b1\/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, where they may help with differential mechanisms of PRRSV infection with different virulence. Using the GenomRNAi database, some linked proteins were found to be related to viruses or inflammation ( Figure 9B ).

Complement protein, C1q, binds to and helps to clear immune complexes composed of immunoglobulins coupled to antigens. The antigenic stimuli for C1q activation in schizophrenia are not known. Food sensitivities characterized by elevated IgG antibodies to bovine milk caseins and wheat glutens have been reported in individuals with schizophrenia. Here, we examined the extent to which these food products might comprise the antigen component of complement C1q immune complexes in individuals with recent onset schizophrenia (n=38), non-recent onset schizophrenia (n=61) and non-psychiatric controls (n=63). C1q seropositivity was significantly associated with both schizophrenia groups (recent onset, odds ratio (OR)=8.02, p\u22640.008; non-recent onset, OR=3.15, p\u22640.03) compared to controls (logistic regression models corrected for age, sex, race and smoking status). Casein-and\/ or gluten-IgG binding to C1q was significantly elevated in the non-recent onset group compared to controls (OR=4.36, p\u22640.01). Significant amounts of C1q-casein\/gluten-related immune complexes and C1q correlations with a marker for gastrointestinal inflammation in non-recent onset schizophrenia suggests a heightened rate of food antigens in the systemic circulation, perhaps via a disease-associated altered intestinal permeability. In individuals who are in the early stages of disease onset, C1q activation may reflect the formation of immune complexes with non-casein-or non-gluten-related antigens, the presence of C1q autoantibodies, and\/or a dissociated state of immune complex components. In conclusion, complement activation may be a useful biomarker to diagnose schizophrenia early during the course of the disease. Future prospective studies should evaluate the impacts of casein-and gluten-free diets on C1q activation in schizophrenia.","text_body":"Immune system factors are becoming increasingly linked to the etiology and pathophysiology of complex neurodevelopmental brain diseases such as schizophrenia and autism (Abazyan et al., 2010; Brown, 2011; Brown and Patterson, 2011; Dohan, 1981; Onore et al., 2011; Reichelt and Landmark, 1995; Rossignol and Frye, 2011; Shi et al., 2009; Stefansson et al., 2009; Yolken and Torrey, 2008) . We have reported strong associations between schizophrenia and a variety of infectious disease and food-derived antigens Dickerson et al., 2010b; Leweke et al., 2004; Niebuhr et al., 2008; Severance et al., 2012; Severance et al., 2010a; Severance et al., 2011a; Yolken and Torrey, 2008) . If antigenic exposures play a part in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, we might expect that immune components involved in early stages of antigen clearance are also affected.\r\n The classic complement pathway immune mediator, C1q, is of particular relevance in this regard and to studies of brain disorders, because it functions both in antigen elimination and in synapse development (Boulanger, 2009; Stevens et al., 2007; Walport, 2001a; Walport, 2001b) . C1q is best known for its role in binding to and facilitating the clearing of antigenantibody immune complexes from systemic circulation (Walport, 2001a; Walport, 2001b) . In recent years, however, C1q has been identified as a cellular component involved in synaptic pruning during perinatal central nervous system development (Boulanger, 2009; Stevens et al., 2007) . Mouse models indicate a high level of early postnatal C1q expression in the brain, as well as a possible neural C1q reactivation in adults in response to cellular signals of neurodegeneration (Boulanger, 2009; Stevens et al., 2007) .\r\n Complement pathway activation may occur at increased rates in schizophrenia, and elevated levels of circulating immune complexes containing C1q have been found in individuals with schizophrenia compared to controls Boyajyan et al., 2008; Mailian et al., 2005; Mayilyan et al., 2008; Vetlugina et al., 1984) . Complement factor C3 proteins were also found to be a part of these complexes, but the antigenic protein initiating the immune response was not identified . Food sensitivities to bovine milk caseins and wheat glutens, as evident by antibody-based measures, have been reported in a number of studies of schizophrenia over the years (Cascella et al., 2011; Dohan, 1981; Dohan et al., 1972; Karlsson et al., 2012; Niebuhr et al., 2011; Reichelt and Landmark, 1995; Samaroo et al., 2010; Severance et al., 2010a) , an indication that these foods might be possible antigenic candidates for C1q binding. Indeed, we have previously reported that immune complexes containing casein are present in blood samples from people with psychiatric disorders (Severance et al., 2011b) .\r\n Here, we sought to examine if schizophrenia-associated C1q activation might co-occur with the formation of immune complexes that contain casein and gluten. We aimed to (1) quantify total IgG antibody binding to C1q, (2) define the subset of C1q immunoreactivity that can be attributed to the formation of immune complexes with food antigens, and (3) determine if either process occurs at altered rates in schizophrenia compared to controls. If food antigen exposure can be linked to a versatile, synaptically-active, basic immune protein such as C1q, future studies will be implemented to explore if caseins and glutens might impact neurodevelopment through a C1q-mediated pathway.\r\n Sixty-one individuals with non-recent onset schizophrenia, 38 individuals with a recent onset of schizophrenia and 63 individuals who had no history of psychiatric disorders were recruited from the Sheppard Pratt Health System, Baltimore, MD, U.S.A. Identification and characterization of individuals into diagnostic groups was performed according to criteria defined by DSM-IV for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder and schizoaffective disorder, as previously described Severance et al., 2010a; Severance et al., 2011a) . In these previous studies, the recent onset schizophrenia group was part of a larger designation of recent onset psychosis, but in the present paper, only those with these DSM-IV schizophrenia-related diagnoses were included Severance et al., 2010a; Severance et al., 2011a) . The two schizophrenia groups (recent onset and non-recent onset) were distinguished from each other by the inclusion criteria that the recent onset group have an onset of psychotic symptoms for the first time within the past 24 months. Individuals without a history of psychiatric disorder were recruited from posted announcements and were screened to rule out current or past psychiatric disorders with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (First, 1998) . Basic demographic data and mean durations of illness of the study populations are shown in Table 1 . Diagnostic groups differed significantly in age, sex, and smoking status as determined by t-tests and chi-square tests. These variables were included in the multivariate analyses described below.\r\n Blood samples were obtained by venipuncture, and serum separated and assessed for antibodies in the assays described below.\r\n The studies were approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of the Sheppard Pratt Health System and the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution according to established guidelines. All participants provided written informed consent after study procedures were explained. The work described was carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans.\r\n Measurement of IgG antibody to C1q-Specific IgG antibodies were measured by ELISAs as previously described with some modification (Severance et al., 2012; Severance et al., 2010a) . Human complement factor C1q was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). In brief, microplate wells were incubated with 100ng C1q protein in 50\u03bcl carbonate buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C, and microplates were blocked for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with 1% (wt\/vol) human serum albumin (HSA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) diluted in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Microplates were then incubated with serum samples diluted 1:200 in PBS-Tween 20 (PBST) for 2h at 37\u00b0C. Microplates were washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-human IgG secondary antibodies for 30min at 37\u00b0C (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, U.S.A.). 2,2\u2032-azino-di-(3ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) hydrogen peroxide solution (KPL Protein Research Products, Gaithersburg, MD, U.S.A.) was added for color development, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm, with a reference wavelength of 490 nm, in an automated microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA, U.S.A.).\r\n Detection of immune complexes-For immune complex detection immunoassays, 100ng of C1q protein in 50ul carbonate buffer was bound to microplates overnight, blocked with 1% HSA and incubated with serum samples as described above. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed at casein or gliadin (a major protein component of gluten) were diluted 1:5000 in PBST and were incubated on the microplates at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. These polyclonal antibodies specific to different subunits of the casein protein molecule were produced as previously described (Senocq et al., 2001) , and the rabbit anti-gliadin antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Microplates were washed, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30min with goat-anti rabbit peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies, washed again and then developed as described above.\r\n Overview-For each microplate, absorbance levels were mean-normalized to the value of that generated by control individuals in order to correct for plate-to-plate variation, as previously described (Severance et al., 2010a) . Multivariate regression models were used to evaluate associations of quantitative antibody levels and seropositivity with diagnosis and to generate disease-specific odds ratios. All multivariate models incorporated the covariates of age, sex, race and smoking status. A p-value of 0.05 or below was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA version 12 (STATA Corp LP, College Station, Texas, U.S.A.).\r\n Quantitative C1q antibody levels-In multiple linear regression models, we examined associations of C1q IgG antibody levels as the dependent variable with the independent variables, diagnosis, age, sex, race, smoking status. We also performed multiple linear regressions to detect correlations of C1q IgG antibody levels with previously generated antibody level data for a variety of antigens including casein, gliadin, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA, a marker of gastrointestinal inflammation), Epstein Barr virus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, measles and Toxoplasma gondii (Severance et al., 2012) . To further quantify relative differences in quantitative antibody levels between diagnostic groups and between sex, race and smoking status subgroups, ANOVAs followed by posthoc Bonferonni and t-tests were used. We also estimated the effect sizes for each schizophrenia group compared to controls using Cohens d definition and corresponding interpretation: small, d=0.2, medium d=0.5, large, d=0.8 (Cohen, 1988) .\r\n C1q antibody and C1q-immune complex seropositivity-C1q and C1q-food antigen seropositivity limits were established based on a cut-off value equivalent to 90% of the control group antibody levels, as previously described (Severance et al., 2010a ). An individual was designated seropositive for an immune complex if she or he was then positive to any one of the casein or gluten polyclonal antibodies tested using the above C1qfood antigen seropositivity definition. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to generate odds ratios for disease association based on these seropositivity designations. In these logistic regressions, diagnostic group served as the dependent variable with C1q seropositivity status as the independent variable (along with age, sex, race and smoking status as covariates).\r\n The immunoassay used to measure all C1q-related IgG is diagrammed in Figure 1 panel A. As shown, this assay detects C1q recognition of IgG-bound antigens in immune complexes as well as C1q autoantibodies. Quantitative levels of total C1q IgG are shown in histogram form in Figure 2 panel A. Multiple linear regressions containing the covariates age, sex, race and smoking status yielded significant associations of C1q antibody levels with diagnosis but not with any of the other covariates (coefficient=0.17, CI=0.06-0.27, p\u22640.002). C1q antibody levels were highest in individuals with recent-onset schizophrenia and moderately elevated in non-recent onset schizophrenia compared to controls (mean + SEM: recent onset 1.81\u00b10.26, non-recent onset 1.41\u00b10.19, controls 1.00\u00b10.12; ANOVA, F=4.50, p\u22640.01; Bonferroni post hoc recent onset vs controls p\u22640.01; one-tailed t-test non-recent onset vs controls (t=\u22121.84, p\u22640.03). Effect size calculations yielded large effect sizes for both the recent onset group (Cohen's d =4.06, r=0.90 ) and the non-recent onset group (Cohen's d =2.58, r=0.80 ).\r\n C1q IgG seropositivity was calculated based on 90% C1q IgG levels found in control individuals. C1q seropositivity according to diagnosis is shown in Figure 2 panel B. Casecontrol differences in seropositivity generated significant age-, sex-, race-and smoking status-corrected odds ratios of 8.02 for recent onset schizophrenia (CI=1.71-37.57, p\u22640.008) and 3.15 for non-recent onset schizophrenia (CI=1.09-9.13, p\u22640.03). There were no significant associations of C1q IgG seropositivity with age, sex, race or smoking status.\r\n We employed the assay diagrammed In Figure 1 panel B to determine if the food antigens, milk casein or wheat gluten, might contribute to the formation of C1q-associated immune complexes. In multinomial logistic regressions, age-, sex-, race-and smoking statuscorrected odds ratios revealed statistically significant associations of immune complex seropositivity with the non-recent onset group compared to controls (OR=4.36, CI=1.38-13.73, p\u22640.01; Figure 3 ). Odds ratios generated separately for casein-containing immune complexes and for gluten-containing immune complexes were also statistically significant for the non-recent onset group compared to controls; these data are shown in Table 2 . Immune complex seropositivity was not significantly associated with the recent onset group in these multivariate regression models.\r\n In the non-recent onset group, multinomial logistic regressions showed a significant association of C1q-food antigen seropositivity with age (OR=1.15, CI=1.06-1.26, p\u22640.001), but not sex, race or smoking status. We further investigated this association and found that individuals in the non-recent onset group who were seropositive for immune complexes were younger (mean years\u00b1SEM 33.20\u00b12.68 vs 45.21\u00b11.48; t=3.99, two-tailed p\u22640.0002) and had a shorter duration of illness (mean years\u00b1SEM 14.00\u00b12.73 vs 23.08\u00b11.66, t=2.75, two-tailed p\u22640.008) than those who were seronegative. Similarly in the recent onset group, individuals who were seropositive for C1q-food antigen immune complexes were also significantly younger than those who were seronegative (19.17\u00b11.46 vs 23.40\u00b11.21, t=1.7, one-tailed p\u22640.05). Conversely, in the control group, seropositive individuals were significantly older than those who were seronegative (38.42\u00b15.42 vs 30.93\u00b11.41, t=\u22121.7, one-tailed p\u22640.05).\r\n C1q IgG antibody levels were significantly associated with casein IgG, gliadin IgG, and ASCA (a marker of GI inflammation) in multiple linear regressions including age, sex, race and smoking status covariates. These data are listed in Table 3 . C1q IgG levels were positively correlated with casein and gluten IgG in both controls and the non-recent onset schizophrenia groups. C1q IgG was further significantly correlated with gliadin IgG in the recent onset group. The ASCA measure of GI inflammation was only correlated with C1q in the non-recent onset schizophrenia group. None of the other antigens tested (influenza A virus, influenza B virus, measles, or T. gondii) were significantly associated with C1q IgG, although the Epstein-Barr virus showed a significant negative correlation with C1q IgG.\r\n This study uncovered two major findings. First, we found significantly elevated levels of complement C1q activation and large effect sizes of C1q antibody levels in individuals with schizophrenia compared to controls. This C1q activation was particularly notable in the recent onset group where the odds ratio of C1q seropositivity for disease association was 8.02 and the effect size was 0.90. The corresponding odds ratio for disease association in the non-recent onset group was also significant at 3.15, with an effect size of 0.80. Secondly, we established that milk casein and wheat gluten comprise the antigen component of C1q-based immune complexes in a prominent portion of individuals with non-recent onset schizophrenia. In this chronically affected group, the presence of an immune complex containing C1q and a casein or gluten food antigen yielded a significant odds ratio for disease association of 4.36.\r\n The recent onset group had a particularly high level of C1q activation, but this heightened C1q was not detected in a bound state to food antigen IgG, a finding that has several possible explanations. The measured C1q immunoreactivity could reflect C1q binding to immunoglobulins coupled to other types of bound antigens, such as antigens from microbial agents. C1q immunoreactivity, however, was not strongly correlated with IgG from a series of infectious disease antigens, but was correlated to IgG from food antigens. Therefore, even though the recent onset group did not show significant numbers of intact food antigenrelated immune complexes, the relevant constituents, C1q and food antigen IgG, were nevertheless present and correlated. It may be that immune complexes were not yet formed in this early stage disease group, or perhaps other conditions led to the dissociation of the components.\r\n Early clinical studies of food antigen-related immune complexes underscore the temporal dynamics of immune complex component interactions (Cunningham-Rundles et al., 1978; Paganelli et al., 1983) . Following milk ingestion, peak levels of unbound circulating bovine casein corresponded to a period when immune complex concentrations were at a minimum, an indication that antigen excess might be involved with complex dissociation . One of the first studies published to examine the role of immune complex formation in schizophrenia reported that levels of immune complexes in patients tended to correlate with disease duration (Vetlugina et al., 1984) . This result is consistent with our discovery of food antigen-based immune complexes predominately in the longer-term schizophrenia group as compared to those with a recent onset of disease. However, within each of the schizophrenia groups, we found that immune complexes were more often present in individuals who were younger compared to older seronegative counterparts. These data suggest that food sensitivities may more likely affect younger subsets of patients, even for those who have been afflicted with the disease for longer periods of time (i.e. recent onset vs non-recent onset).\r\n Another explanation for the heightened C1q immunoreactivity in the recent onset group could be the presence of C1q autoantibodies produced early during disease pathogenesis. The assay used to determine total C1q activation would also detect antibodies generated against the C1q protein. Autoimmune diseases are known risk factors for the development of schizophrenia (Benros et al., 2011) , and a number of studies have documented the increased presence of antibodies to a variety of cellular proteins such as the \u03b17 nicotinic receptor, smooth muscle actin, cardiolipin, serotonin, and transglutaminase-6 in individuals with schizophrenia (Cascella et al., 2012; Chandley et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2011; Laske et al., 2008; Schott et al., 2003) . In other reports, anti-gluten antibodies formed in children with autism were strongly associated with anti-peptidase antibodies, perhaps suggesting an autoimmune response directed at a bound gluten-peptidase complex (Vojdani et al., 2004a; Vojdani et al., 2004b; Vojdani et al., 2003) . Anti-gluten and anti-casein peptide antibodies were also found to associate with the immune molecule anti-CD26 and anti-CD69 autoantibodies, thus suggesting another source of food antigen-associated autoantibody target (Vojdani et al., 2003) .\r\n We also found that in the non-recent onset schizophrenia group, C1q was associated with a marker of GI inflammation, ASCA, which is used to aid the diagnosis of Crohns Disease. We recently reported elevated levels of this type of inflammation in individuals with schizophrenia and found it to be correlated with antibodies to food antigens (Severance et al., 2012) . GI permeability brought on by inflammation represents a logical means by which food antigens might be introduced into systemic circulation. Cunningham-Rundles and colleagues put forth years ago that the formation of milk casein-related complexes is likely a response to a greater circulating peptide load following the excessive absorption of milk proteins across the gastrointestinal tract (Cunningham-Rundles et al., 1978; Cunningham-Rundles and Carr, 1986 ). As stated above, the general lack of correlation of C1q with the infectious disease antigen IgG and a strong correlation with food antigen antibodies further reinforces a GI origin of the observed C1q activation.\r\n A number of issues limit the extent to which our results can be fully interpreted. The current study is cross-sectional, and therefore, any changing levels of immune complex components over time are not captured in this type of study. Age, sex and smoking status were all identified as possible confounding variables, and thus were included in the multivariate regression models utilized here. As discussed earlier, immune complexes were more often found in younger individuals in both schizophrenia groups; for sex and smoking status, we found no significant associations of these variables with the present results. In previous studies of mood disorders, we were able to disentangle a particular association of food antigen antibodies with clinical features of mania and psychosis (Dickerson et al., 2012; Severance et al., 2010b ). In the current study, however, evaluation of the clinical impact of our findings in schizophrenia is limited. Large-scale, well-controlled, prospective clinical studies are required to identify specific symptoms that might be affected by casein and gluten intake in individuals with schizophrenia and to evaluate how dietary modifications might affect symptom severity.\r\n The interaction of genes and environmental factors is increasingly implicated in complex neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. In the context of the present study, we can speculate that an altered function of complement and other immune-related genes might allow the decreased clearance of circulating antigens, which might in turn reflect an imbalance in immune complex components. Genetic studies of the complement pathway in schizophrenia reveal that variants containing single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the C1QB gene, in complement control-related genes and in the complement surface receptor gene CD46 all segregate with the disorder (Havik et al., 2011; Zakharyan et al., 2011) . Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are also of interest to our C1q findings, because MHC class I proteins may similarly act to modify synaptic plasticity during neurodevelopment (Boulanger, 2009; Shatz, 2009 ). Genome-wide association studies in schizophrenia identified the chromosomal area housing the MHC genes as a potentially important candidate region (Purcell et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2009; Stefansson et al., 2009) . These associations suggest the possibility that genetic variants in MHC alleles might control how antigens are recognized and which antibodies are actually generated.\r\n We can further hypothesize that the presence of these anti-C1q or anti-food antigen antibodies during pregnancy or in breast milk could potentially expose the developing brain to unanticipated C1q activation. In a large birth registry-based study in Sweden, elevated levels of maternal anti-gliadin IgG were recently found to increase the risk of nonaffective psychosis in offspring (Karlsson et al., 2012) . Maternally-derived food antigen IgG, therefore, could in theory contribute to fetal or postnatal activation of C1q. If this process occurs during a critical period of C1q-mediated synaptic pruning, then it is reasonable to predict that there will be adverse effects on synaptic organization in the brain. Upon reexposure as adults, food antigens separately or in conjunction with C1q reactivation could contribute to and\/or aggravate psychiatric symptoms and behaviors.\r\n In conclusion, a significant portion of C1q activation in non-recent onset schizophrenia can be attributed to the formation of immune complexes with the food antigens, milk caseins and wheat glutens. In individuals who are in the earlier stages of their disease, C1q activation is most prominent and may reflect the generation of C1q autoantibodies, formation of immune complexes with non-food-related antigens, or the dissociated state of immune complex components. Our data provide a starting point to examine if perinatal exposure to food antigens in susceptible individuals represents a plausible means by which C1q synaptic pruning defects could be generated and ultimately result in symptoms and behaviors characteristic of schizophrenia.\r\n \u2022 We identified significant C1q activation in schizophrenia compared to controls.\r\n \u2022 Milk caseins and wheat glutens were prominent antigens of C1q immune complexes.\r\n \u2022 Especially elevated C1q activity in recent onset schizophrenia may aid early stage diagnosis.\r\n \u2022 Disease-associated C1q activation has implications in synapse pruning processes.\r\n Immunoassays to measure total C1q IgG levels and C1q-food antigen associated immune complexes.

Sixty-one individuals with non-recent onset schizophrenia, 38 individuals with a recent onset of schizophrenia and 63 individuals who had no history of psychiatric disorders were recruited from the Sheppard Pratt Health System, Baltimore, MD, U.S.A. Identification and characterization of individuals into diagnostic groups was performed according to criteria defined by DSM-IV for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder and schizoaffective disorder, as previously described Severance et al., Diagnostic groups differed significantly in age, sex, and smoking status as determined by t-tests and chi-square tests. Blood samples were obtained by venipuncture, and serum separated and assessed for antibodies in the assays described below. The studies were approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of the Sheppard Pratt Health System and the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution according to established guidelines. All participants provided written informed consent after study procedures were explained. 2,2\u2032-azino-di-(3ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) hydrogen peroxide solution (KPL Protein Research Products, Gaithersburg, MD, U.S.A.) was added for color development, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm, with a reference wavelength of 490 nm, in an automated microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA, U.S.A.). Microplates were washed, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30min with goat-anti rabbit peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies, washed again and then developed as described above. All multivariate models incorporated the covariates of age, sex, race and smoking status. A p-value of 0.05 or below was considered statistically significant. We also estimated the effect sizes for each schizophrenia group compared to controls using Cohens d definition and corresponding interpretation: small, d=0.2, medium d=0.5, large, d=0.8 (Cohen, 1988) . C1q antibody and C1q-immune complex seropositivity-C1q and C1q-food antigen seropositivity limits were established based on a cut-off value equivalent to 90% of the control group antibody levels, as previously described (Severance et al., There were no significant associations of C1q IgG seropositivity with age, sex, race or smoking status. We employed the assay diagrammed In Figure 1 panel B to determine if the food antigens, milk casein or wheat gluten, might contribute to the formation of C1q-associated immune complexes. In the non-recent onset group, multinomial logistic regressions showed a significant association of C1q-food antigen seropositivity with age (OR=1.15, CI=1.06-1.26, p\u22640.001), but not sex, race or smoking status. Conversely, in the control group, seropositive individuals were significantly older than those who were seronegative (38.42\u00b15.42 vs 30.93\u00b11.41, t=\u22121.7, one-tailed p\u22640.05). C1q IgG antibody levels were significantly associated with casein IgG, gliadin IgG, and ASCA (a marker of GI inflammation) in multiple linear regressions including age, sex, race and smoking status covariates. None of the other antigens tested (influenza A virus, influenza B virus, measles, or T. gondii) were significantly associated with C1q IgG, although the Epstein-Barr virus showed a significant negative correlation with C1q IgG.\r\n This study uncovered two major findings. First, we found significantly elevated levels of complement C1q activation and large effect sizes of C1q antibody levels in individuals with schizophrenia compared to controls. We recently reported elevated levels of this type of inflammation in individuals with schizophrenia and found it to be correlated with antibodies to food antigens (Severance et al., 1978; Cunningham-Rundles and Carr, 1986 ). A number of issues limit the extent to which our results can be fully interpreted. As discussed earlier, immune complexes were more often found in younger individuals in both schizophrenia groups; for sex and smoking status, we found no significant associations of these variables with the present results. In the context of the present study, we can speculate that an altered function of complement and other immune-related genes might allow the decreased clearance of circulating antigens, which might in turn reflect an imbalance in immune complex components.

As lung is steadily exposed to multiple infectious agents, antigens and host-derived danger signals, the inhabiting stromal and myeloid cells of the lung express an aggregate of TLRs which perceive the endogenously derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) along with pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and trigger the TLR-associated signalling events involved in host defence. Thus, they form an imperative component of host defence activation in case of microbial infections as well as noninfectious pulmonary disorders such as interstitial lung disease, acute lung injury and airways disease, such as COPD and asthma. They also play an equally important role in lung cancer. Targeting the TLR signalling network would pave ways to the design of more reliable and effective vaccines against infectious agents and control deadly infections, desensitize allergens and reduce inflammation. Moreover, TLR agonists may act as adjuvants by increasing the efficiency of cancer vaccines, thereby contributing their role in treatment of lung cancer too. Overall, TLRs present a compelling and expeditiously bolstered area of research and addressing their signalling events would be of significant use in pulmonary diseases.","text_body":"Lungs are repeatedly divulged to several environmental stimuli including chemicals, dust, pollen along with numerous microorganisms. They are competent enough to oppose these environmental stimuli with the help of various host defences. Composite nasal passage geometry, airways branching pattern, secretion of mucus and soluble mediators like surfactant proteins, lysozyme, secretory IgA and antimicrobial peptides are the exemplifications of host defences. Furthermore, alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells provide a perpetual vigilance for pathogenic components. At the same time, they are also implicated in inhibiting T cell responses against non-pathogenic antigens [1] . These normal processes of host defences are trivial, but an inflammatory response is anticipated in case of a prolonged exposure to pathogenic antigens or highly virulent microbes. Prompt commencement of an inflammatory response is accomplished with the help of unique and conserved Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present on the surface of myeloid cells, lung epithelial cells and lymphoid tissue. PRRs comprise of Toll like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) and NOD like receptors (NLRs). These receptors are activated upon binding to their respective ligands, which trigger the release of cytokines and chemokines that calls for recruitment of antigen presenting cells and leukocytes at the site of infection and consequently induces the adaptive immunity [2] .\r\n Perpetual communication of respiratory tract with the environmental stimuli put a constraint on the host immune system to differentiate innoxious and pathogenic exposures in a robust manner. To accomplish this, TLRs selectively recognize unique microbial patterns called Pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [3, 4] . Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan in cell wall of gram-positive bacteria, flagellin of bacterial flagella, dsRNA and ssRNA of viruses etc. act as PAMPs [5] [6] [7] . PAMPs are recognized by the receptor called Pattern recognition receptors or PRRs present on the cells of the innate immunity, i.e. monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils etc., non-immune cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells etc., and in various intercellular compartments like endosome and lysosome. Thus, PRRs can detect extracellular as well as intracellular pathogens. There are different types of PRRs and each type can recognize multiple pathogenic species that share a particular type of PRR and TLR is one among them [3] . TLRs are crucial components of the innate immune system, used to recognize and defend against invading pathogens. Toll is a gene in fruit fly and toll-like proteins have been found in animals and are known as TLRs. They are conserved and there are about 10 functional TLRs (TLR1 to TLR10) in humans and 12 (TLR1 to TLR9, TLR11 to TLR13) in mice. Human TLRs; TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6 and TLR10 are expressed on cell surface, while TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are expressed on the membrane of intracellular vesicles [5] [6] [7] [8] .\r\n Other than PAMPs, studies have reported the existence of Damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are known to be the ligands of TLRs. It was first suggested by studies on heat shock proteins [9] . These DAMPs originate from the host such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), hyaluronan and heat shock proteins as they are released from damaged tissues [5] [6] [7] , act as danger signals to alert the cells. In case of an injury, damaged tissues release certain intracellular components into the surroundings, some of which specifically activate TLRs. Detection of endogenous ligands may also lead to the incipience of autoimmune responses. For instance, HMGB1 proteins normally reside in the nucleus, but when released from apoptotic cells in a complex with nucleosomes can give rise to lupus like symptoms upon activation of TLR2 [10] . Breakdown of extracellular matrix also act as damage signals. Similarly, ischemic injury results from temporary blood flow loss and oxygen supply. Cell deaths during ischemia release damage signal and allow influx of WBCs, which instigate more detrimental and highly exaggerated inflammatory response [8] .\r\n Each TLR is a horse shoe like structure with variable number of Leucine rich repeats (LRRs) at N-terminal facing the extracellular matrix, if present, on surface of the cell; while face lumen if present in intracellular vesicles. The intracellular or cytoplasmic domain is designated as Toll\/IL-1R (TIR) as it shares similarity with Interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R). TIR is involved in mediating the interaction between TLR and adaptor proteins and transducing signal while LRRs is believed to recognize ligands [11] . Signalling pathways activated downstream of the adaptor molecule interacting with TIR domain promote the expression of cytokines, chemokines, interferons, which assist in pathogen removal by recruitment of other immune cells and activation of specific adaptive immunity. Some TLRs work in dimer form, either homodimer or heterodimer [12] . It is also associated with other protein families like MD2 and CD14 to increase ligand diversity (Table 1) [13, 14] . After the binding of ligand to the receptor, TIR interact with intracellular adaptor proteins like MyD88, TRIF (TICAM-1), TIRAP (MAL), TRAM (TICAM-2) and activate the downstream signalling pathways. MyD88 dependent pathway and TRIF dependent pathways are the two primarily involved signalling pathways, however, other adaptor proteins act as bridge molecules. MyD88 acquires three domains: an amino-(N-) terminal death domain (DD), a carboxy-(C-) terminal Toll\/IL-1R (TIR) domain and a short linker sequence. One of its intermediate domain (ID) is in connection with IL-1R-associated kinases 4 (IRAK4) involved in TLR signalling [15, 16] . All TLRs except TLR3 use MyD88-dependent signalling. On the other hand, TRIF (a large protein consisting of 712 amino acids in humans) binds to TLR3 directly and indirectly to TLR4 by means of an adaptor protein, TRIF related adaptor molecule (TRAM) [15] . It is known to possess a significant role in induction of inflammatory mediators, that consequently induce antiviral innate immune responses via TLR3 and TLR4 mediated signalling. This was confirmed upon defective expression of IFN-related genes, mediated by TLR3 and TLR4 in TRIF knockout mice. However, TLR4 mediated MyD88 pathway activation and early phase activation of NF-\u03ba\u03b2 was also observed. Thus, TLR4 is unique as it uses both pathways [3] . Activated TLRs initiate a cascade of events which involves variety of protein kinases that eventually leads to the activation of certain transcription factors like NF-\u03ba\u03b2, MAPKs, IRFs, AP1 [4, 12] . These factors enter the nucleus, binds DNA, transcribe and translate proteins that consequently enhance innate immune response and initiate adaptive immune responses against the pathogen ( Fig. 1) [7, 17, 18] . Inappropriate or unregulated activation of TLR signalling can lead to chronic inflammation and autoimmune disorders.\r\n TLRs are extensively expressed on resident as well as infiltrating myeloid and lymphoid cells in the lung tissue. TLR1 to TLR10 are expressed on primary bronchial epithelial cells, and consequently release CXCL8 (IL-8) upon activation of TLRs by several ligands [19] . Lower levels of TLR3, TLR5, TLR9 and higher levels of TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR8 have been found to be expressed on the surface of human alveolar macrophages [20] . TLR4 is expressed on lung endothelial cells and is imperative for capillary concealment and neutrophil recruitment after systemic administration of LPS [21] . Recruited neutrophils also express TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 [22] . These markers and anatomical locations can be used to distinguish different subsets of dendritic cells (DCs) [23] . Significantly high levels of TLR7 and TLR9 have been found to be expressed on lung plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), which give rise to regulatory T cells and are also involved in suppressing allergic response [24] .\r\n TLR mediated responses are cell or tissue location dependent. This can be illustrated as -In the basal layers of airway epithelium, TLR2 and TLR4 are most relevant and maintained at low expression levels, but in inflamed cells and pathogenic infection, there is an upsurge in their MyD88, TIRAP  MyD88  TLR-3  Intracellular  CD14, TRIL  dsRNA  Viruses  TRIF  TRIF  Poly(I:C)  Synthetic analogue of dsRNA  TLR-4  Cell surface  CD14, MD-2  LPS, F-Prot  Bacteria  MyD88, TIRAF, TRIF, TRAM  MyD88, TRIF  RSV, VSV, Env-prot, MMTV others.  Viruses  TLR-5  Cell surface  Flagellin  Bacteria  MyD88  MyD88  TLR-7  Intracellular  CD14  ssRNA  Viruses  MyD88  MyD88  TLR-8  Intracellular  CD14  ssRNA  Viruses  MyD88  TLR-9 Intracellular CD14, HMGB1 Unmethylated CpG DNA Bacteria, protozoa and viruses MyD88 MyD88 Mitochondrial DNA Endogenous expression levels [25, 26] . Moreover, TLR4 is intracellular but can be willingly transferred to the surface of the cell for pathogen recognition [27] . It has been found that TLR4 is one of the host extracellular and cellular proteins, along with MD-2, HBD-2, CD14 and LBP (LPS binding protein); required for a precise response to several endotoxins. Human airway epithelial cells abundantly express TLR4 very little HBD-2 and little or no MD-2, thus they have to induced in these cells upon exposure to specific bacterial or host products in order to generate an appropriate response against the endotoxins [28] . In addition, TLR3 and TLR5 in the human airway epithelia also play important roles in ligand recognition [11, 29, 30] . Additionally, levels of TLR expression in cells cannot always be coordinated with the functional response [20, 31] . This can be explained as enhanced secretion of TNF-\u03b1 by alveolar macrophages, IL-6 and IL-10 by interstitial macrophages has been observed even when the levels of TLR mRNA are comparable [20] . Moreover, cellular activation of lung tissue can also be achieved via co-operative interactions with TLR expressing lymphoid cells. This was demonstrated by activation of airway smooth muscle cells, by IL-1\u03b2 released by monocytes stimulated by LPS. Therefore, both intrinsic cellular mechanisms and co-operative interactions between resident and recruited cells play a significant role in determination of response to TLR ligands in the lung.\r\n A large number of commensal organisms are in continuous contact with the upper epithelium of respiratory tract which includes nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx [32] . In case of a respiratory disease or allergic conditions, production of mucus and anti-microbial substances is the primitive response of epithelial cells [11, 17] . Mucins (protein component of mucus) expression is induced either directly or indirectly by TLR signalling [11, 33] . In the lower respiratory tract; trachea, bronchi,  and lungs express TLR3 on the luminal and basal side, whereas TLR2,  TLR6 and TLR1 on basolateral side. TLR6 are present in high levels,  lower levels of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR10 along with TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 are present on both cell surface as well as intracellular compartments [34] . In response to various TLR ligands, primary bronchial epithelial cells express TLR1 to TLR10 and secrete the chemokine CXCL8 (IL-8) [3, 19] . TLR4 expressed in lung endothelial cells is crucial for neutrophil recruitment [22] and capillary sequestration [3, 21] . Dendritic cells of lungs act as sentinels and bridge innate and adaptive immunity. TLR7 and TLR9 are highly expressed by lung pDCs (plasmacytoid DCs) that suppress the allergic response and regulatory T cells are raised by regulatory lung DCs [3, 24] . It has been shown that alveolar macrophages express TLR3, TLR5 and TLR9 and higher levels of TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR8 [3, 20, 31] . Thus, TLR signalling is implicated in secretion of cytokines, chemokines, interferons like TNF\u03b1, IL-8, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, RANTES, GRO-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03b3, IL-6, IL-5 and TGF\u03b2 which are necessary for promoting influx of professional phagocytic\/ killing cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, NK cells, macrophages and DCs that are ultimately responsible for removal of pathogen [11, 35, 36] . In addition, TLR signalling is also involved in production of anti-microbial substances such as defensins, lysozyme, nitric oxide (NO) and IL-37 in lower respiratory tract [11] . Boron has been found to equilibrate the LPS-CD14\/TLR4\/MD2 complex in a study, leading to release of pro inflammatory cytokines by M1 macrophages [37] . 1 . TLR signalling -TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6 and TLR10 are expressed on the surface of the cell whereas TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 in intracellular vesicles like endosome and lysosomes. All TLRs except TLR3 activates MyD88 pathway, TLR3 and TLR4 activate TRIF pathway. When ligand binds to the TLR receptors, adaptor molecules MyD88 and TRIF bind to the TIR domain either directly or indirectly via bridge molecules TIRAP and TRAM. MyD88 now recruits IRAK4 which in turn phosphorylate and activate IRAK1\/2. The activated IRAKs now interact with TRAF6. This IRAK-TRAF6 complex recruits and activates TAK1. It also gets activated directly by MyD88 and RIP1. Activated TAK1 activates IKK complex and MAPKs. IKK complex phosphorylates and subsequently degrade I\u03ba\u03b2 by proteasomes leading to release of transcription factor (TF) NF-\u03ba\u03b2 whereas activated MAPKs releases transcription factor AP1 by activating JNK1\/2 and p38. These TFs translocate into the nucleus and bind to their corresponding TF binding segment on the DNA to induce transcription of cytokines, chemokines, interferons, interleukins etc. In TRIF pathway, TRIF binds to TIR domain via bridge molecule TRAM. TRIF binds TRAF3 and TRAF6. By binding to TRAF6 it normally activates MyD88 pathway whereas by binding with TRAF3 it activates TKB1 which further phosphorylates and activates IRF3 and IRF7. Their homodimers enter nucleus and binds to its binding segment on DNA and transcribe IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2.\r\n Pathogen identification is a crucial component for induction of innate immune system in case of inflammation and is moderated through receptors termed PRRs, the pattern recognition receptors, which detect conserved molecular motifs on pathogens called PAMPs (pathogen associated molecular patterns) [38] . PRRs induce multitude of signalling pathways for accomplishment of early host response upon PAMP recognition, which is essential to kill infectious pathogens.\r\n The first recognized PRRs were TLRs. TLRs identify broad array of PAMPs [13, [39] [40] [41] . In humans, ten members of TLR family have been recognized and each one sense specific PAMPs derived from several pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, mycobacteria (Table 2 ) [4, 39] . Identification of particular PAMPs by TLR initiate signalling cascade, upon recruitment of adaptor molecule (for example MyD88), leading to discharge of interferon, chemokines and host defence peptides; which initiate macrophage activation, stimulation of interferonstimulated genes (ISGs) and recruitment of neutrophils causing infected microbe killing [4, 42] . Certain TLRs are localized to intracellular vesicles while some are localized to the cell surface. TLR9, TLR8, TLR7 and TLR3 sense nucleic acids and are localized in intracellular vesicles. Cell surface TLRs such as TLR6, TLR5, TLR4, TLR2 and TLR1 sense microbial structures [43] .\r\n TLR-deficient mice have been used to study the role of TLRs in bacterial infections. The gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus comprises numerous TLR PAMPs. Lipoteichoic acid and lipoprotein are sensed by the TLR6-TLR2 heterodimer. After the infection with Staphylococcus aureus, there was decline in TLR2 deficient mice survival [44] . After sinus and eye infection, TLR2 deficient mice signify increase in disease severeness and bio burden [45] suggesting that the TLR2 mediated sensing of the bacterial lipoproteins stimulates an immune response against Staphylococcus aureus. But in case of bacterial brain abscess, both mice groups (control and TLR2 deficient) showed indistinguishable responses on bioburden and survival [46] . According to study of Miller et al. and Takeuchi et al 2000, in several mice infection groups, TLR2-deficient mice group was less vulnerable to bacterial infection than MyD88 deficient mice group, which proposed the role of another TLRs and IL-1R family members in stimulating immune responses [44, 46] . Thus, both TLR2 signalling and IL-1R, in conjoint have been found to initiate immune responses against Staphylococcus aureus infection.\r\n The gram-negative bacterium Salmonella typhimurium comprise numerous PAMPs sensed by TLRs. Cytidine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) DNA sensed by TLR9, lipoprotein sensed by TLR2, flagellin sensed by TLR5 and LPS sensed by TLR4 [45] . After the infection with Salmonella typhimurium, TLR4-deficient mice indicated growth and Salmonella typhimurium accumulation inside Mesenteric lymphadenitis and was found to be more vulnerable to bacterial infection than control group. Weiss et al. reported that even during lack of functional TLR4, TLR2 efficiently respond to the infection as TLR4 and TLR2-deficient group was more vulnerable to the infection than TLR4 knock-out group [47] .\r\n Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), the causative pathogen of tuberculosis is present in aerosol particles. M. tuberculosis reproduce in the phagosome of dust cells (alveolar macrophages). TLR9, TLR4 and TLR2, expressed on the surface of alveolar macrophages recognize the primary Mycobacterium infection and initiate transcription of IL-6, TNF\u03b1 and IL-12 inflammatory cytokines in order to regulate infection [45, 48] . According to some reports, M. tuberculosis inhibited the MyD88 dependent TLR2 signalling [4, 49] . MyD88 deficient mice group infected with M. tuberculosis was highly vulnerable to the infection and exhibited high bioburden and reduced secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12, suggesting that sensing of M. tuberculosis by TLR generated innate immunity against Mycobacterium infection [48] . According to several reports, high dosage of Mycobacterium infection into TLR9 and TLR2 deficient mice groups showed high vulnerability to infection but some reports suggested that low dosage of Mycobacterium infection into TLR9, TLR4 or TLR2 deficient mice group showed very less vulnerability to infection [48] . According to Holscher et al. [270] , both control and TLR9-TLR4-TLR2 deficient mice groups infected with Mycobacterium exhibited controlled growth of M. tuberculosis in lung. Hence, TLRs sensing discrete M. tuberculosis PAMP are mostly superfluous in stimulating the innate immune response against low dose aerosol infection of M. tuberculosis.\r\n Invasive candidiasis is an infection caused by fungus Candida and is a life-threatening infection for immunosuppressed individuals. Dendritic cells recognize the Candida infection and initiate the secretion of cytokines as well as the upregulation of molecules that cause na\u00efve T cells differentiation in T helper 17 cell (Th17), T helper 2 cell (Th2), T helper 1 cell (Th1) and Regulatory T (Treg) cells. It has been reported that innate immunity is repressed by inducing a detrimental Treg and Th2 cells response in a mouse model infected with Candida albicans. However, Th17 and Th1 cell responses play a vital role in protection against Candida albicans infection. Candida species comprise numerous PAMPs such as mannan, nucleic acids, chitin and \u03b2-glucan and these PAMPs are sensed by TLR9, TLR7, TLR6, TLR4 and TLR2 [50, 51] .\r\n PAMP such as mannans is expressed through Candida albicans (C. albicans) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) is sensed by TLR4 leading to the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 [50] . According to the Netea and Marodi, TLR4 defective C3H\/HeJ mice infected with C. albicans exhibit reduced secretion of cytokines and chemokines through macrophages and the group was more vulnerable to the infection than control mice. Moreover, TLR4 deficient mice group primarily infected with less virulent Candida yeast and re-infected with Candida hyphae exhibited vulnerability to the infection. But some reports also suggested that when TLR4-deficient mice are infected with Candida hyphae, they live more than control mice group [50] .\r\n MyD88 deficient mice infected with Candida albicans show high vulnerability to the infection. The role of IL-1R\/TLR mediated responses has been owed to the high vulnerability of mice [52] . There are some conflicting studies on specific TLRs function to stimulate host immune responses against Candida spp. According to some reports, TLR2 plays redundant role against fungal infection in in vivo conditions. TLR2 deficient mice group is more vulnerable to the Candida fungal infection than the control mice group and secrete low level of chemokines and TNF-\u03b1. Furthermore, Both TLR2 deficient mice group and control mice group are defended against another challenge with virulent Candida albicans, even though, TLR2 deficient mice group exhibit reduced production of antibody against less virulent Candida species than control mice group [50] . Several reports suggested that, TLR2 mediated sensing of Candida species can be detrimental for the host species, as TLR2 deficient mice show reduced production of IL-10 and elevated secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 and due to this, TLR2 deficient mice exhibit more resistance against Candida species infection Fungus  TLR7  RNA  TLR4, TLR2  Mannan  TLR6, TLR2  \u03b2-Glucan, zymosan  TLR9  DNA  Mycobacteria, bacteria  TLR7  RNA  TLR4  Lipopolysaccharide  TLR9  DNA  TLR6, TLR2, TLR1  Lipoproteins  TLR5  Flagellin  Viruses  TLR8, TLR7, TLR3  RNA  TLR9  DNA  TLR4, TLR2 Structural protein than control group [53, 54] .\r\n In viruses, nucleotides act as PAMPs and are sensed by several TLRs. Viral nucleic acids like DNA is sensed by TLR9, dsRNA is sensed by TLR3, and ssRNA is sensed by TLR8-TLR7 [7] . Viral DNA rich in CpG domains are sensed by TLR9 [39, 43, 55, 56] . The TLR-mediated recognition of viral nucleotides stimulates the secretion of cytokines and IFN type-1 [57] .\r\n TLR4 and TLR2 are the cell surface TLRs which detect viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion proteins are sensed by TLR4 and initiate secretion of cytokines. TLR4 also senses envelop protein of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). TLR4 deficient mice exhibit reduction in IL-12 secretion and reduced levels of mononuclear cells infiltration leading to the reduction in viral clearance [39] . Inactivated H5N1 avian influenza virus causes acute lung injury into mice and TLR4 deficient mice group is defended against the injury. Oxidative stress recognized by TLR4 also play role in inflammation [58] . Viral products like Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Measles virus hemagglutinin (MV-H) glycoproteins are recognized by TLR2 and produce inflammatory cytokines [2] . Moreover, TLR2 also initiate IFN type-1 production in cell type specific manner. After infection with inactivated vaccinia virus (VV), dendritic cells and macrophages produce inflammatory cytokines but not IFN type-1 via TLR2 whereas inflammatory monocytes induce IFN type-1 through TLR2 [59] . Furthermore, TLR2 mediated stimulation of IFN type-1 does not need nucleotides [60] .\r\n TLR3 induces secretion of IFN type-1 and inflammatory cytokines needed for virus elimination. However, there are conflicting reports regarding the demand of TLR3 in in vivo conditions for protection against viral infection. When TLR3 deficient mice group is infected with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), it exhibits depletion in IFN type-1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12p40 secretion and depletion in activation of Natural Killer and Natural Killer T cells. Due to this, TLR3 deficient mice group is more vulnerable to viral infection than control mice group [61] . Negishi et al., reported that, in Coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) infection, TLR3 dependent IFN-\u03b3 signalling is required for protection against the infection whereas IFN type-1 signalling is not required for protection [62] . Furthermore, TLR3 deficient mice group is more vulnerable to the virulent West Nile virus (WNV) infection than the control mice group [63] . Wang et al. [271] reported that TLR3 deficient group exhibits more survival rate against the WNV infection than the control group. Although, some reports suggested that, after infection with viruses like MCMV, Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Reoviruses and Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), deficiency of TLR3 does not influence CD8+ T and CD4+ T cells. Thus, it can be said that TLR3 is not required for protection against viruses [64] .\r\n Acute lung injury (ALI) is a lethal disease described by an exaggerated host defence immune response in which influx of inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, into the lung tissue perpetuates a vicious cycle of inflammation that amplifies the accumulation of these cells [65] . A central pathogenic feature underlying ALI is the breakdown of lung epithelial-endothelial barrier function due to widespread cell death and disassembly of endothelial adherens junctions [65] [66] [67] . An intact barrier tightly controls lung vascular permeability [66] and leukocyte recruitment [68] , whereas its disruption results in tissue oedema, neutrophil influx, activation of procoagulant pathways, and release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 [65] . ALI may be caused by bacterial or viral infection or could be a repercussion of non-infectious outrage including hyperoxia, trauma or environmental toxins such as ozone, heavy metals. Also, lungs are invariably exposed to circulating pathogens and bacterial endotoxins such as the LPS, which are known to induce inflammatory responses and are key for the pathogenesis of ALI [69] . TLRs conciliate ALI by identifying specific PAMPs such as LPS or endogenous DAMPs such as HMGB1, heat shock proteins, fibrinogen or hyaluronan [70, 71] , which, in turn activates inflammation [72] [73] [74] . The inflammatory response could be benign or adverse for host, depends upon the nature and severity of the instigating stimulus. Alterations in macrophage polarization may also influence the severity of acute inflammation in lung [75] . It could be beneficial for the preservation of tissue integrity and repair of host tissues but prolonged inflammatory responses may lead to aggravated fibrosis and accumulation of fluid in the lungs which could be detrimental for the lung tissue [58, 76] . Severe bacterial pneumonia is one of the most common causative factor of ALI, ARDS and lung injury leading to enhanced pneumonia associated mortality and morbidity. TLR4 plays an important role in bacterial clearance in case of Pseudomonas pneumonia as well as Klebsiella pneumonia. This effect is mediated by GM-CSF (Granulocyte -macrophage colony stimulating factor), a pleiotropic growth factor that possess cytoprotective effects on alveolar epithelium [77] . GM-CSF is responsible for governing the intensity of inflammation by regulating the activation of Akt and Erk kinases, leading to activation of NF-\u03ba\u03b2 and AP-1transcription factor complex respectively. Moreover, suppression of GM-CSF has direct effects on activation of these kinases, generating anti -inflammatory effects, which could have clinical implications too in inflammatory diseases [78] .\r\n It has been found that Hemorrhagic shock (HS), customarily seen in trauma patients leads to excessive inflammatory responses resulting in development of ALI [79] . Studies based on mouse models of HS-induced ALI with LPS as the secondary stimulus have demonstrated that increased secretion of inflammatory mediator CXCL8, pulmonary oedema and enhanced neutrophils incursion are a result of cross talk between TLR2 and TLR4 [73, 79, 80] . Similarly, TLR4 is implicated in protection against hyperoxia-induced ALI by promoting the expression of Bcl-2 and Phospho Akt (anti apoptotic factors) [81] . On the other hand, TLR3 promotes ALI as evident from study demonstrating that TLR3 deficient mice show reduced neutrophil influx, increased expression of surfactant proteins and stimulation of pro-apoptotic factors which protects them from ALI [82] . Furthermore, TLR2 and TLR4 are also involved in mediating macrophage inflammatory responses to hyaluronan fragments in case of Bleomycin-induced lung injury [83] .\r\n TLR7 has been associated with production of IFN type-1, important for clearance of viruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV). TLR4 and MyD88 also possess a protective role in case of SARS infection [84, 85] . TLR7 also plays a significant role in case of influenza infection. They are expressed on pDCs and mediate cell specific immune response via MyD88-dependent IFN induction. Bcell isotype switching is also observed in case of influenza infection and is mediated by MyD88 and IPS-1 (adaptor molecule involved in cytosolic RIG-I pathway) [86] . TLR3 is seen to be highly upregulated in human alveolar bronchial and epithelial cells during influenza infection. Moreover, RIG-I, NLRP3 and NOD-2 have also been found to be associated with immune response against influenza infections [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] .\r\n Cystic Fibrosis, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder is described by chronic inflammation, caused by prolonged bacterial colonization. Acute pneumonia or chronic lung disease with sharp, intermittent aggravations, as a result of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection are the major causes of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis [92] [93] [94] [95] . It has been observed that functional TLRs are expressed on both CF and non-CF lung epithelial cells but does not affect the susceptibility of chronic and gradual P. aeruginosa infection [96] . This has been confirmed by a study in which expression of surface TLR1 to TLR5 and TLR9 was observed in both human CFTE29o (CFTR) and 16HBE14o (bronchial non CF) cell lines [96] . TLR6 mRNA was found to be expressed in both cell lines but only CF cells retorted to MALP-2, a TLR2\/TLR6 agonist [96] . Recently, it has been shown that bacterial flagellin and expression of TLR5 plays a significant role in enhanced inflammatory responses, observed upon stimulation of IB3-1 cells (CF airway epithelial cells) with clinical Pseudomonas isolates as compared to cell line expressing wild type CFTR gene. Moreover, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CF patients also displayed aggravated inflammatory response upon stimulation with TLR ligands and P. aeruginosa in comparison to healthy controls. They also expressed higher levels of TLR5, suggesting the role of TLR5 in modulating host immune response via an undetermined mechanism. TLR5 was also selectively increased in airway but not circulating neutrophils from CF patients, but not in patients with Bronchiectasis and healthy controls [22] . TLR5 expression on neutrophils can be functionally related to chronic infection as they are implicated in phagocytosis, respiratory burst and flagellin dependent IL-8 secretion [22] . This association was confirmed by a study which showed abbreviated neutrophil recruitment, MCP-1 production and bacterial clearance, upon low dose stimulation with flagellated P. aeruginosa as compared to isotypic non flagellated strains [97] . In addition, TLR 4 detects LPS and TLR2\/TLR4 detects ExoS toxin of P. aeruginosa [16, 30, 98] . Similarly, MyD88 also exhibit a momentous role during the early phase of inflammation as loss of MyD88 may confer hyper-susceptibility, enhanced bacterial load, reduced neutrophil influx while TLR deficiency does not collogue susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection [97, 99, 100] . TLR2 and TLR4 signal via MyD88 dependent and independent pathways, whereas TLR5 signals via MyD88 exclusively. However, the complicated pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infection leads to inconsistent results in studies for determination of relative contribution of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5 [101] .\r\n Other than P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Burkholderia cenocepacia are also correlated with early and progressive lung disease associated with CF, respectively [102, 103] . Severe pneumonia and sepsis in CF patients is a result of B. cenocepacia infection and stimulates damage to lung epithelial cells along with secretion of TNF-\u03b1 [104, 105] . Higher mortality has been observed due to flagellin mediated activation of TLR5 and MyD88 in case of B. cenocepacia infection [105] . MyD88 plays a very important role in inflammation associated with B. cenocepacia also, as demonstrated by a study which showed that loss of MyD88 decreased inflammation and mortality of mice despite higher loads of infection [106] .\r\n COPD is a respiratory disorder designated by irreversible limited expiratory airflow and aberrant inflammation [4] . Smoking is the most provocative risk factor for COPD in humans and the disease prevalence is age associated [107] . Disease pathogenesis is not well appreciated but impaired function of alveolar macrophages, defective mucociliary clearance and aberrant expression of airway antimicrobial polypeptides are customarily observed in COPD [108] . Consequently, there is a gradual loss of lung function, due to an atrocious circle of inflammation generated upon establishment of pathogens in the lower respiratory tract [109] . Evidences have suggested that a typical innate immunity contributes to the disease pathogenesis [110] . Recent studies show that TLR4 perpetuates the lung oxidant\/antioxidant balance by regulating the expression of NADPH oxidase 3 in structural cells. This was confirmed when increased oxidant stress, elastolysis and tissue necrosis (all features of age-related emphysema) were observed in TLR4 and MyD88 deficient mice. Thus, it was also hypothesized that free radicals and oxidants of tobacco smoke may supersede innate immunity, resulting in cell necrosis and damage to lung tissue [111] . A brief exposure of cigarette smoke leads to TLR4, MyD88 and IL-1R1 mediated neutrophilic airway inflammation in mice [112, 113] . However, C3H\/HeJ mice having naturally impaired TLR4 signalling establish less chronic inflammation after cigarette smoke exposure for 5 weeks [114] . Cigarette smoke exposure in for the long haul induced strain dependent emphysema in mice, while no association with TLRs was established [115] . There are several studies discussing the association of TLR function and expression in smokers, non-smokers and COPD patients. One of the studies has shown that the expression of TLR2 reduces in alveolar macrophages of smokers and COPD patients upon ex vivo ligand stimulation. However, the relative expression of TLR4 was insignificant. Other study reported the commensurate level of expression of TLR2, TLR4, CD14 or MD2 but stimulation of alveolar macrophages with ligands of both TLR2 or TLR4 decreases the expression of mRNA and protein of inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) and chemokines (such as RANTES and IL-8), exhibit defective NF-\u03ba\u03b2 activation, concealed IRAK-1 and p38 phosphorylation in smokers [116] . Therefore, it was suggested by authors that TLR2 and TLR4 mediated inflammatory response is dependent upon exposure time of LPS via cigarette smoking that selectively reprograms alveolar macrophages [117] . Another study reported decreased expression of TLR2 mRNA with no changes in TLR4 expression in nasal and tracheal epithelial cells of smokers in comparison to non-smokers [118] . However, expression of TLR4 and HBD-2 (an inducible antimicrobial peptide) is found to be increased in case of mild COPD. On the other hand, advanced COPD reduces their levels of expression [118] . Thus, several studies have been carried out to determine the inflection of TLR expression upon exposure to cigarette smoke and it was concluded that various factors such as degree of bacterial colonization, content of LPS in cigarette smoke and persistent inflammatory conditions, account for modulation of levels of TLR expression. Hence, a more powerful host response in case of mild COPD corresponds to enhanced TLR4 expression, and reduced expression in case of severe COPD can be correlated with impaired innate immunity [118] .\r\n Moreover, cigarette smoke gaseous and particulate phase contains 4500 or more components encompassing noxious particles, reactive chemicals and free radicals and an overly studied risk factor for COPD. The components of cigarette smoke instigate and augment immune cells such as the macrophages [119] . Damage to lung tissue occurs due to hypersecretion of mucus, mucociliary malfunction and inflammation. The cigarette smoke provocative response accumulates neutrophils, monocyte, dendritic cells, proinflammatory mediators, ROS, factors attracting T-lymphocyte and proteolytic enzymes. These responsive features are crucial players in COPD [120, 121] .\r\n Toll like receptors associated to cigarette smoke-induced inflammation are TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9. An extensive research has been done on TLR4 function such as by Karimi et al., who showed TLR4 involvement in cigarette smoke-persuaded cytokine production [122] . Sarir et al. revealed that TLR4 surface manifestation is reduced upon brief exposure of cigarette smoke [123] . Pace et al. corroborated TLR4 involvement in cigarette smoke-inciting CXCL8-lung inflammation employing epithelial cells [124] . Maes et al. demonstrated that on subacute cigarette exposure neutrophils, lymphocyte levels in BALF were reduced in TLR4 knockout mice when compared with control wild type mice [115] . TLR4 role in COPD evidence comes from a population study which reported connotation between TLR4 polymorphism (TLRD299G, TLR2R753Q, TLR4T3991) and in 240 heavy smokers COPD development was investigated [125] . Deteriorated polymorphic TLR4T3991 contribute to COPD development in smokers, an exposition to upsurge susceptibility to infections whereas polymorphism of D299G TLR4 has been linked to reduce COPD severity due to LPS hypo reactivity. To fully explicate the function of TLR-polymorphism in COPD, more research is needed. Deficiency of TLR4 in mice results in pulmonary emphysema [111] . This shows TLR4 participation in healthy tissue homeostasis. Overall, above knowledge summarizes TLR4 mediated inflammation generated by components of environment as well as deregulated TLR4 in disease.\r\n TLR2 altered function and expression, upon exposure of cigarette smoke has also been linked to COPD. When COPD patients and cigarette smokers were compared with wild type, a decreased expression of TLR2 on macrophages were observed [117] . Moreover, mRNA and protein expression of TLR2 was not elevated after triggering macrophages with LPS in smokers and COPD patients. Howbeit, Pons et al. reported increased TLR2 expression on monocytes from COPD patients [126] . This shows disagreement with the Droemann et al. findings [117] , but Pons study was on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), signifying a dissimilarity in TLR2 expression in terms of alveolar and systemic effects.\r\n Role of TLR9 in cigarette smoke-persuading signalling has been elaborated by a group who established in vitro, implication of TLR9 in cigarette-induced production of CXCL8 by neutrophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells [127] . Evidence supporting role of TLR9 instigation in cigarette smoke-persuading inflammation invent from a study in which transfected cell line TLR9 human embryonic kidney (HEK) were used. TLR9 deficient cells showed decrease production of CXCL8. Synthetic CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), a TLR9 ligand targeting mice lung gave rise to infiltration of neutrophils, systemic inflammation along with increased pulmonary permeability [128, 129] . This oligonucleotide inciting inflammation has been implied to be based on TNF\u03b1. TLR9 was also found to be rodent specific due to increased transcription of TLR9 in rodent lung [130] . On the other hand, LPS treatment can upregulate TLR9 expression in lungs of horses. Henceforth, in non-rodent mammals, the expression of TLR9 and CpG-ODNs response might increase due to specific co-stimulatory patterns [131] . TLR9 stimulation induces various host defence genes expression, including IFN-\u03b1\/\u03b2, which is required for antimicrobial immunity. Howbeit, on exposure of cigarette smoke extract, this effect is suppressed in vitro. Surprisingly cigarette smoke stimulates TLR9 mediated IL-8 expression and influx of neutrophils implying that ongoing smoking potentiates detrimental inflammation in airways in response to infection, in addition to impaired host airway defence.\r\n Among viral ligands, TLR4 also interacts with viral pneumococci toxin pneumolysin [132] However, TLR4 interactions seems to be specific for nasopharynx as indicated by a study in which TLR4 deficient mice possessed very mild impairment of host immune response, upon direct infection of lower respiratory tract with pneumococcal toxin [133, 134] . Pneumococcal infection also upregulates the expression of TLR2 and aggravates the host inflammatory response [135, 136] . Other PRRs are also involved in case of Streptococcus pneumoniae infections as indicated by a study wherein there is clearance of high and low infectious doses of S. pneumoniae with a moderate reduction in production of inflammatory mediators in TLR2 deficient mice [134, 137] . TLR4 recognizes pneumolysin, an intracellular toxin secreted by Streptococcus pneumonia. Despite TLR2 plays a decisive role in host defence against gram positive bacteria, nevertheless S. pneumoniae can be perceived by TLR4, even in the absence of TLR2 [138] . TLR9 also plays a role, as TLR9 deficiency increases the susceptibility to pneumococcal infection [139] . On the contrary, reduced production of inflammatory mediators (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1), unconstrained systemic bacterial dissemination and airway pneumococcal growth has also been observed in case of rescission of MyD88 signalling [140] . The severity of response against S. pneumonia is enormously increased in case of MyD88 deficiency rather than single or combined deletion of TLR2 and TLR4 respectively [141] .\r\n COPD aggravations are also associated with non-typeable H. influenza (NTHi) infection. Although both TLR2 and TLR4 ligands are involved, but TLR4\/MyD88 is the most assertive immune signalling pathway involved in in vitro and in vivo bacterial clearance. TLR3 also exhibit a role in production of inflammatory mediators but their bestowal in bacterial clearance is ambiguous [142] .\r\n Asthma is a deadly disease that causes chronic airway inflammation described by discursive bronchoconstriction, hyperplasia of goblet cells, excessive secretion of mucus and tissue remodelling that eventuates in childhood. Host immune response against environmental stimuli of asthma i.e. pollen or dust particles constitutes the inhabitance of antigen specific Th2 cells secreting antigen specific IgE in lung [143, 144] .\r\n Innate immunity plays a significant role in pathogenesis of disease as viral and bacterial infections can be correlated with stimulation or defence against asthma [145] . It has been reported by several epidemiological, human and animal studies that time and degree of LPS exposure and hence activation of TLR4 determines the type of response i.e. whether a defensive Th1 response or an acquiescent Th2 response is generated [146] . This can be illustrated as Th2 response develops upon intranasal administration of low dose of LPS in lung whereas a robust Th1 response is generated upon administration of LPS elsewhere in the body. Nonetheless, airway hyperresponsiveness, allergic sensitization and eosinophilic inflammation is repressed upon treatment with TLR agonists or microbes [147] [148] [149] . Recent studies have shown that intranasal administration of Acinetobacter lwoffii F78 into pregnant mice provides protection against ovalbumin-induced asthma in the progeny. The protective effect depends upon maternal pattern of TLR expression and recognition of microbes by maternal TLRs during pregnancy primes the foetal lung environment for a later Th1 response against these antigens [150] . TLR4 expressing lung resident cells recognize house dust mite (a pervasive home allergen) and induces Th2 cell response to produce IL-25, IL-33, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and thymic stromal lymphopoietin. These cytokines leads to activation and polarization of ingenuous lymphocytes. Also, neurotoxin derived from eosinophil stimulates TLR2 activation, that eventually leads to enormous secretion of IL-6, IL-10 and Th2 polarization [152] . Similarly, basophils also lead to Th2 cell activation [153] .\r\n TLRs are also implicated in augmentation of allergic asthma as shown by numerous genetic association studies. For instance, TLR7 and TLR8 are correlated with progression of asthma whereas their ligands safeguard against airway remodelling in experimentally lured asthma [154] . The ligands for TLR10 are not defined yet, but their SNPs share correlation with asthma in two independent samples. TLR4 and TLR9 are associated with wheezing, while TLR4 is related to secretion of allergen specific IgE [155] . Hence, TLR9 ligands are in clinical trials for prevention or treatment of asthma at present [156] . Furthermore, bacterial infections such as Mycoplasma pneumonia, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumonia may worsen the disease conditions [157] . It was shown that MyD88 deficient mice infected with C. pneumonia exhibited reduced cytokine and chemokine expression, deferred recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, and inability to clear lung bacterium resulting in chronic inflammation and high mortality [158] . However, secretion of IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3 and other inflammatory mediators may be enhanced at later stages through MyD88 independent pathway but that are incompetent to preclude C. pneumonia associated mortality [159] .\r\n TLR2 and TLR4 either act in concert or other PRRs are also involved in C. pneumoniae infection as indicated by normal recovery of TLR2 and TLR4 deficient mice with proper bacterial clearance from C. pneumoniae infection [160] . M. pneumoniae infection leads to hypersecretion of airway mucin and upregulation of TLR2. However, TLR2 is inhibited during allergic inflammation caused by M. pneumoniae infection, along with reduced production of IL-6 and other mediators, needed for bacterial clearance [161] . Antibiotic treatments are highly effective in treating asthmatic patients with M. pneumoniae infections as they improve their pulmonary function and are suggestive of the contributions of bacterial interactions with the host immune system in asthma aggravations and mortality [162, 163] . Other PRRs are also involved in case of Streptococcus pneumonia infections as indicated by a study wherein there is clearance of high and low infectious doses of S. pneumonia with a moderate reduction in production of inflammatory mediators in TLR2 deficient mice (Cite reference [118, 121] ). The severity of response against S. pneumonia is enormously increased in case of MyD88 deficiency rather than single or combined deletion of TLR2 and TLR4 respectively (cite reference [124] ).\r\n Viruses such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) also contribute to development and aggravations associated with asthma. RSV, in particular causes acute bronchiolitis and wheezing in children, that subsequently progresses into asthma [164, 165] . Wheezing due to serious infection with RSV in early years of life is associated with enhanced Th2 response, IL-10 secretion and eosinophilia [166, 167] . As a result, TLRs are found to be extensively upregulated in human tracheal epithelial (9HTEo) cells. In the course of RSV infection, virus attaches to the lung epithelial cells via G protein, followed by fusion of viral envelope with host cell plasma membrane mediated by F protein [168, 169] . TLR4 recognizes the viral F protein and stimulate NK cells [164, 170] . Thus, TLR4 deficient mice possess elevated viral load and defective NK cells [171, 172] . According to a study, inadequate TLR4 signalling is also associated with enhanced worsening in pre-term infants [173] . Additionally, dsRNA formed during RSV replication stimulates TLR3 mediated signalling in human lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells, resulting in exaggerated secretion of the chemokines RANTES and IP-10 [170] . Deficiency of TLR3 signalling leads to enhanced mucus secretion, airway eosinophilia and increased expression of IL-5 and IL-13. Recently, it has been demonstrated that expression of IFN-\u03b2 induced by RIG-I, in the time of RSV infection, brings about TLR3 activation, suggesting the role of TLR3 in mediating secondary immune signalling pathway. Contrastingly, RSV viral clearance is totally mediated by TLR2\/TLR6 heterodimers. Thus, allergic asthma can be mediated by infection and worsened by genetic predispositions. These infections may lead to protective inflammatory responses in some cases or acute allergic responses in other cases or may be permissive towards prolonged Th2 response.\r\n Lung cancer is one of the foremost causes of cancer associated deaths all over the world. Inflammation is one of the hallmarks of cancer and tumor microenvironment also consists of cells that play highly significant roles in inflammation. These cells thus, actively participate in innate immune responses, wherein TLRs also play key roles. TLRs present on cells of the innate immune system are activated upon recognition of specific ligands and induce host adaptive immune responses consequently. Thus, TLRs act as a double edged sword where on one side identify cancer specific antigens and activate innate responses and on the other side, promote latent chronic inflammation by inducing persistent adaptive responses which promote the process of tumorigenesis [174] [175] [176] . Since TLRs are extensively expressed on resident as well as infiltrating myeloid and lymphoid cells (responsible for activation of adaptive responses), the maintenance of a fine equilibrium between stromal and haematopoietic cells become very crucial in case of cancer. TLR activation on both types of cells calls for recruitment of immune stimulating or tolerogenic cells, both of which participate in the process of oncogenesis. This can be explained as -activation of TLRs present on epithelial cells induce production of chemokines (such as IL-8, a strong neutrophils chemoattractant) and growth factors such as the Vascular endothelium-derived growth factor (VEGF) that is a key factor of angiogenesis [177] [178] [179] [180] . Similarly, TLR activation on innate immune cells helps in processing of antigens and their presentation, promotes the expression of CD80\/86 (co-stimulatory molecules) which are involved in activation of T cells and finally secretes IL-6 that modulates the activity of Treg cells [181, 182] . Activation of TLRs also promotes the production of IL-12p19 or IL-12p35 and IL-27, favouring Th1 or Th17 immunity, respectively [183] . Th1 exerts anti tumor immunity while Th17 can possess either pro-tumor or anti tumor activity, that is tissue or organ dependent [184] . One of the study has demonstrated the anti tumor activity of Th17 immunity in IL-17 knockout mice [185] . Thus, Th1 response generates a protective response, however, Th2 response bedews the host immune response, promoting latent chronic inflammation. This chronic inflammation can lead to the proliferation of transformed cells that can evade the immune system in cancer conditions. Interestingly, Treg cells are involved in these alterations of Th2 responses and hence play crucial roles in tumor immunology, determining the destiny of lung cancer cells. Moreover, several studies have displayed the role of TLRs in cancer development and progression [177] . Nonetheless, the debate on their protective role in immune system activation to fight against cancer and their cancer promoting role by facilitating chronic inflammation is still on [186] .\r\n As in other cases, TLRs expressed on dendritic cells play equally important roles in lung cancer too as upon TLR ligation and activation, they act as guards to look for antigens which are then presented and processed by T cells to generate adaptive immune responses. Thus, they act as a bridge between innate and adaptive immune system [187] . TLR 1 to TLR9 are expressed on both human and mouse myeloid dendritic cells, but their roles in lung carcinoma have not been elucidated yet. pDCs express TLR7\/8 and TLR9 responsible for the production of IFN\u03b1\/\u03b2 in MyD88 dependent manner [188, 189] . IFN type-1 plays significant role in CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, NK cell activation and proliferation, production of cytokines and TRAIL-mediated cell death [190] , but their functions in lung carcinoma have not been defined yet. However, it is speculated that tumor microenvironment debilitates their anti tumor functions [191] . In addition, TLR2, TLR4, TLR7\/8 and TLR9 are highly expressed in lung carcinoma tissues, and stimulate the production of IFN type-1 and IFN-\u03b3, which in turn, promotes the production of IL-10, TGF-\u03b2 (immunosuppressive cytokines) and tolerogenic enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) [189, 192] . As a consequence, these cytokines and tolerogenic enzyme induces the production of adaptive and natural Tregs, involved in host immune alterations [193] . pDCs bind Treg through PD-1\/PD-L1 (immune checkpoint regulators) while TGF-\u03b2 (induced by TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9) stimulates production of Treg or Th17 [194, 195] . TLR9 activation by CpG-ODN enhances lung metastasis in IL-17 knockout mice, however tumor burden reduces in other tumor models [185] . This discrepancy could be due to tissue specificity.\r\n On the other hand, B cells express TLR7 and TLR9 in an enormous level. TLR9 binds to CpG and causes B-cell polarization to acquire B-1 phenotype, which promotes tumor regression in mice [189, 196] . However, in other study B cells act as antigen presenting cells and immunoglobulin producing cells, leading to tumor regression in mouse model [197] . Moreover, roles of other TLRs in B-cell derived immunity needs further elucidation. Similarly, lung macrophages express high levels of TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR6 as compared to TLR7 and TLR9. Tumor macrophages are polarized to M2 phenotype, upon TLR stimulation. These macrophages are termed as Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), expressing high levels of TLR2. Stimulation of TLR2 signalling pathway promotes lung metastasis [198] . Likewise, TLR4 signalling in TAMs also increases cancerous lesions [199] . CpG-ODN (type B) activation of TLR9, recruits an enormous amount of macrophages into the lungs of mice poised with tumor [200] . Deficiency of MyD88 reduces tumor growth owing to reduced incursion of macrophages to the tumor microenvironment [201] . MyD88 mediated signalling activates M2 phenotype while TRIF dependent signalling, strongly induced by TLR3 activation, stimulates M1 phenotype of macrophages. TLR activation on macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) repress immune surveillance of tumor cells [202] . It was confirmed in a recent study wherein TLR2 activation on MDSCs promotes tumor immune evasion, thereby enhancing tumor growth in lung adenocarcinoma, lymphoma and colon carcinoma [203] . Additionally, MDSCs are recruited to the lung upon administration of CpG-ODN (ligand of TLR9) into the mice bearing tumor [197] . Thus, MDSCs and Tregs, both have important contributions in progression of lung tumors and are swayed by activation of TLRs; elucidation of their roles in lung cancer would be therapeutically very beneficial.\r\n NK cells, one of the leading effector cells against tumors are scarcely activated by MyD88 dependent pathway, but TRIF dependent pathway lures their cytotoxicity. It has been found that absence of TRIF mediates tumor progression upon administration of Poly I:C (a ligand of TLR3) [204] . However, in case of prostate cancer, Poly I:C administration regresses tumor growth as activation of TLR3 can also result in apoptotic cascade [205] . TLR7 and TLR9 signalling reduces upon viral infection [206] , thereby reducing innate immune response in the course of tumorigenesis. NK cells are also activated upon activation of TLR2-MyD88 on mDCs. However, reduced lung metastases have been observed due to NK cell activation upon administration of ligands of TLR3, TLR7\/8 [207] [208] [209] . Similarly, mast cells are also present in several tumor types and the activation of mast cell receptors and TLRs stimulate a number of growth stimulatory mediators and pro-angiogenic factors that enhance tumor proliferation. Contrastingly, TLR2 activation on mast cells reduced lung carcinoma growth upon subcutaneous implantation of LLC1 cells in mouse model [210] . Oldford et al. have demonstrated that TLR2 activation on mast cells facilitate release of IL-6 and CCL1, responsible for consequent increase in antitumor activities and recruitment of NK and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells [200, 211] . Although lung cancer bears Th2 based pathology, the role of mast cells in tumor progression remains elusive.\r\n Development and progression of lung cancer involves anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2 [212] , IL-10 and growth factors such as VEGF and Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), which are induced by activation of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9. In lung epithelial cells, TGF-\u03b21 has been recognized to facilitate apoptosis and inflammation [212] . However, TLR2 and TLR4 activation induces extracellular matrix remodelling and EGFR-mediated signalling, respectively, stimulating progression of lung carcinoma [213, 214] . Exceptionally, TLR9 signalling along with cetuximab (an inhibitor of EGFR signalling) regresses tumor growth [215] . However, activation of TLR9 by CpG-ODN promotes the growth of human tumor epithelial lung cells [216] . Further, TLR9 activation induces release of VEGF, thereby promoting the growth of tumor cells [217] . The role of TLR3 and TLR7 signalling has not been yet explored in lung carcinoma. Although, TLR3 and TLR7 activation induces apoptosis and hence facilitate tumor regression in prostate and melanoma models of mouse as well as in in vitro studies conducted on human lung cancer cell line treated with imiquimod, a TLR7 ligand [218] . VEGF released from CpG-ODN induced lung carcinoma, acts as a pro-tumor factor, expediting the angiogenesis of cancer cells and recruitment of inflammatory cells, favouring anti-tumor activity [213, 217, 219] . Thus, VEGF may act as both pro-tumorigenic and antitumorigenic. More significantly, TLR2 and TLR4 activation also causes the extradition of extracellular matrix proteins such as fibrin and hyaluronan, which may act as DAMPs, exaggerating the inflammatory processes [213, 220] . Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and chemokines such as IL-8, and ICAM-1 are released upon activation of TLRs present on endothelial cells, and bolsters the recruitment of leukocytes to the lung [221] . Surprisingly, endothelial cells upregulate PD-1 and secrete high levels of IL-10, TGF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, thereby promoting recruitment of immunosuppressive cells such as pDCs which interacts with Tregs, to the lung, and hence enhance the immunosuppressive abeyants of activated Tregs [222] . Immunosuppressive effects could also arise from activation of MDSCs mediated by MyD88 signalling. These MDSCs are also associated with release of DAMPs such as HMGB1, vimentin, hsp72 into the tumor microenvironment. HMGB1 is recognized by TLR4 and TLR9, whereas hsp72, vimentin and HMGB1, all act as ligands for TLR2, which upon activation initiate a series of inflammatory processes associated with cancer development and progression [176, 203] .\r\n Extensive studies over the years have revealed a broad array of role played by TLRs in activation of innate immune response against various infectious agents and intrinsic molecules suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. Dysregulation of TLR in induction of pro-inflammatory signalling cascade leads to continued cytokines and chemokines secretion. This makes TLRs a causative reason for several diseases such as auto-immune disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), asthma, allergic rhinitis and ischemia reperfusion injury [223] .\r\n Consequently, TLRs are being targeted in a dual way -by development of small molecule ligands (agonists) which have the ability to bind with TLRs and augment host immune capabilities and also act as adjuvants in vaccine therapies and by inhibiting TLRs through specific antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, oligopeptides and by improving endogenous anti-TLR molecules. Also, negative regulation of signalling pathways involving TLRs are also gaining interest as a novel therapeutic strategy. Apart from infectious and inflammatory diseases, targeting TLRs have demonstrated promising effects in non-infectious diseases, including lung airway disease, ALI, and interstitial lung disease (ILD) [224] .\r\n Emerging data have shown that TLRs like TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7 and TLR9 are linked with various diseases and could be activated by agonists making them compelling immunomodulators and adjuvants. These agonists are catalogued either as cell surface or intracellular molecules on the basis of TLRs location. TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, and TLR10 are cell surface TLRs whereas TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are included in intracellular TLRs [225] . TLR4 is unique in itself as it can be active on the cell surface and also intracellularly in specific cells [225] . The microbial component, LPS, can activate TLR4 and its signalling by inducing the formation of a symmetric M-shaped TLR4-MD-2-LPS multimer which, in turn stimulates the production of TNF-\u03b1, as well as increase the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in tumor cells, making it a possible therapeutic strategy for lung cancer treatment [226] . A TLR4 agonist MPL (monophosphoryl lipid A), derived from lipid A of Salmonella minnesota is an approved vaccine adjuvant in the Europe for hepatitis B and HPV virus [227] . Further, MPL works potently as an adjuvant in allergy vaccines and is used to treat asthma as it specifically activates the TRAM\/TRIF pathway in TLR4 signalling and regulates CD80\/86 complex which is vital for conferring MPL vaccine adjuvant ability [228] . MPL is also recently being used in combination with other molecules to synthesize novel vaccines such as Pollinex Quattro, which is currently in a Phase III clinical trial against seasonal airway allergies [229, 230] . In addition, OM-174, a TLR4 agonist which is a purified form of lipid-A developed from E. coli has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in mice models by increasing IFN-\u03b3 production [231, 232] . Few chemically synthesized TLR4 agonists, for example E6020 are vaccine adjuvants [233, 234] . Apart from this, the aminoalkyl glucosaminide phosphates which are lipid A derivatives, are safe and effective adjuvants for influenza virus vaccine [235, 236] . In a murine model of allergic type lung inflammation, poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid (\u03b3-PGA) which is a TLR4 agonist is seen to cause downregulation of Th2 cytokines, airway inflammation and eosinophilia while increasing the manifestation of co-stimulatory molecules, CD80, CD86 and CD40 on dendritic cells [237] . Recently, a synthetic TLR4 agonist (ER803022) has been developed which shows potential against asthma in mouse models in a TLR-dependent MyD88 activation and IL-12\/IFN-\u03b3 production [238] . TLR2 is LPS receptor and identifies several ligands especially that of Gram-positive bacteria, a synthetic TLR2 agonist known as Pam3CSK4 shows anti-asthmatic properties by reducing Th2 cytokine release, airway inflammation and other symptom. Pam3CSK4 has two thioester linked lipid chains through which it binds to a TLR2 pocket and a small channel of TLR1, hence forming a bridge between the two molecules [239] . SMP-105 is a TLR2 agonist from Mycobacterium bovis that consists of mycolic acids, and peptidoglycans is an approved drug for bladder cancer [240] . This compound upregulates NF-\u03ba\u03b2 in a TLR2 dependent and TLR4 independent manner leading to decrease in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels and can be used as an adjuvant as anti-inflammatory agent [240] . Another ligand, Macrophage activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2) binds to TLR2\/ TLR6 heterodimer and is effective against asthma. It is acquired from Mycoplasma fermentans and induces IFN-\u03b3, CD80 (B7-1), CD86 (B7-2), MHC I and II in response to allergies [241] . A study showed that in a murine model of asthma, MALP-2 causes the decrease of AHR, eosinophilia and Th2 cytokines. In addition, it stimulates T cell, B cell and natural killer cell accumulation in lungs of adult mice [242] . Similarly, Lipoprotein 1 and Lipopeptide-CGP40774 are TLR2 agonists capable of controlling asthma and airway inflammation by suppressing IgE production, IL-4 and IL-13 production [243, 244] . Accumulating evidence have indicated that activating TLR7 not only suppresses Th2mediated airway inflammation but also decreases the manifestation of IgE, additionally it significantly inhibits IL-17 and IL-13 production through IL-10 mediated pathway [245] . Therefore, TLR7 is thought to recuperate airway diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. Indeed, Imiquimod is a clinically approved TLR7 agonist for basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis and external genital wart [246, 247] . This drug also works against asthma and viral induced lung and airway infection by increasing IFN-\u03b1 via TLR7-MYD88 dependent pathway. Another compound Resiquimod (R-848), a TLR7 and TLR8 agonist displayed great tendency to induce IFN-\u03b1, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 production while reducing lung eosinophilia and airway inflammation in in vivo models [248, 249] . A synthetic TLR7 agonist SA-2 regulates T cell production through IFN-\u03b1, IL-27 and IL-10 and shows promising therapeutic potential [250] . ANA773 is a small molecule TLR7 agonist which is under phase I clinical trial for its anti-viral potential [251] . One of the most investigated class of compound developed for exacerbation of asthma known as CpG-ODN, is a TLR9 agonist [252] . It interacts with TLR9 present on leukocytes, B cells and T cells and stimulates the secretion of IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12 and CD4 T lymphocytes, in turn eliciting a Th1 type of inflammatory response along with enhanced IL-12 and IL-10 production [253] . It also suppresses Th2 cytokine, airway eosinophilia, IgE levels, and bronchial hyperreactivity in in vitro and in vivo models [254] [255] [256] . CpG-ODN has shown encouraging results in clinical trials against asthma and allergic rhinitis as well [257] . Other TLR9 agonists like indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase, IMO-2055, MO-2125 and IMO-2134 are reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic responses [258, 259] . A TLR3 agonist, Rintatolimod is also being experimented for treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza, hepatitis infections and cancer. It is reported to modulate cellular RNase L enzyme levels in patients [260] .\r\n Recent advances related to the structure and role of TLRs in normal physiology as well as in diseased conditions have led to their exploitation for developing novel therapeutic strategies. In this pursuit, TLR antagonists are being examined for treatment of various diseases mainly autoimmune disorders, although none of them have succeeded to be taken further than clinical trials. Antagonist treatment can reduce unwarranted inflammation by hindering the interaction between TLRs and pro-inflammatory ligands and their downstream signalling molecules. TLR2 and TLR4 antagonists are well studied and show great promise in preventing several diseases. Recently, a TLR4 antagonist, under acylated form of Rhodobacter sphaeroides LPS (RS-LPS) when inhaled, reduced the symptoms of asthma by inhibiting eosinophilia and lymphocytosis, also by reducing the levels of Th2 cytokines and lower airway hyperresponsiveness [261] . RS-LPS acts as a TLR4 antagonist by inhibiting the induction of IkBz (gene NFKBIZ, a member of the NF-kB family, playing a significant role in functioning of epithelial cells) in bronchial epithelial cells, consequently leading to inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines -IL6 and GMCSF in a co-culture based study of bronchial epithelial cells and monocytes stimulated with house dust mite mix (HDM) [262] . One of the few synthesized antibodies that target TLRs is NI-0101, which is specific to TLR4 and blocks TLR4 dimerization. It has the potency to reduce cytokine secretion and averts flu and its symptoms in ex vivo and in vivo models. This drug has successfully completed phase I clinical trial and is proven to be a safe and non-toxic drug at various concentrations [263] . 1A6, another anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibody is effective in reducing inflammatory disorders and has positive role in lung injury models [264] . Lipid A analogues specifically targets TLR4 signalling and has become potential therapeutic tool against airway diseases. Eritoran TM (E5564) is a TLR4 antagonist that affects TLR4\/MD-2\/LPS complex formation is the most advanced TLR agonist and is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trial for treatment of sepsis [265] . A fully humanized IgG4 monoclonal TLR2 specific antibody, OPN-305 blocks TLR2-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in pre-clinical phase I studies [266] .\r\n Antagonists of TLR7 are also in focus for their anti-asthmatic effects along with their bronchodilatory mechanism which leads to protection from airway obstruction during viral infections. One such TLR7 antagonist is R837 that plays a critical role in relaxing the airway passage through production of nitric oxide in a TLR7 dependent manner in in vitro as well as in vivo models [267] . Recently, capsazepine and its analogues have been considered as TLR3 inhibitors and they have shown to repress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 in asthmatic patients [268] . Apart from synthesized compounds, a natural product known as Resveratrol that is found in grapes and peanuts down regulates TLR3 and one of its adapter molecule (TRIF) and provides a defensive mechanism against asthma development [269] . Though, antagonist therapy shows great potential, but their use can cause damage to the local immune defence and can result in development of other opportunistic disorders.\r\n Despite the substantial amount of research going on for development of novel TLRs agonist or antagonist in the treatment of airway as well as other diseases only limited success have been achieved. The failure of these drugs at clinical trials is most probably a result of inappropriate dosage, toxicity, lack of proper time and route of administration. However, continuous effort and holistic approaches would open newer ways for utilizing these compounds as medicinal agents in the near future.\r\n An extended exposure of lung to environmental aggravations and likely pathogens perpetuates the innate immune system to acquire a critical role in maintenance of lung tissue homeostasis. TLRs are principally involved in activation of innate immune system and an enormous amount of research has been carried out in recent years to explore the role of TLRs in host defence and tissue homeostasis. The acumens of this work have enabled us to predicate general principles associated with lung innate immunity. These principles involve development of acute pulmonary diseases (for instance -bronchiolitis and ALI) customarily lead to progression of chronic inflammatory conditions such as fibroproliferative ARDS or may lead to exposition of relapsing or remitting conditions as found in asthma. Secondly, infections (bacterial, fungal or viral) are the most prominent causes of prolonged inflammation in lung tissue, as represented by severe RSV infection preceding asthma development and progression of ARDS following severe influenza and pneumonia. Furthermore, aberrations in innate immune system lead to the evolution of chronic obstructive lung diseases. These disorders may be due to direct or indirect predilection of host to infection as in case of chronic P. aeruginosa infections leading to Cystic fibrosis, and S. pneumonia infections leading to subtle aggravations of COPD. Irrevocably, tissue remodelling, and repair are imperative for pathogenesis of lung inflammation along with host defence, and TLR mediated mechanisms reconcile these processes. Similarly, TLRs are also involved in lung cancer development and progression. Contemporary studies have demonstrated the tumor promoting as well as tumor suppressing roles of TLR signalling. Activation of TLRs on cells of tumor microenvironment can promote immune evasion by alterations of Tregs, thereby promoting tumor cell proliferation. On the other hand, they are also involved in activating immune system to generate anti-tumor immunity. Moreover, it has been reported that TLRs mediate activation of immune cells present in tumor microenvironment, which may result in anti-tumor as well as pro-tumor effects, but the role of TLRs in tumorigenic effects have not yet been fully elucidated.\r\n Although, TLR activation plays a critical role in progression of lung inflammatory diseases, there are still many questions that have to be answered. Besides this, using TLRs as therapeutic targets involve use of TLR agonists or antagonists. Few TLR agonists and antagonists have been used a therapeutic modality in case of airway diseases but success has not yet been achieved due to several reasons involving dosage toxicity and inappropriate time and route of administration. Thus, more studies are needed to explore their potential as a therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, a profound understanding of TLR associated mechanisms will help us elucidate the links between innate immune system and development of chronic inflammatory conditions in lung tissue. This knowledge will benefit us to identify TLRs as novel therapeutic targets that could limit the burden of pulmonary diseases.\r\n Not applicable.\r\n Not applicable.\r\n Not applicable. \r\n The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest associated with this manuscript.","sha":"e87197f407ee7d0428c28ec1a6983c3aa0167b03","publish_time":"2019-09-15","authors":"Arora, Shweta; Ahmad, Shaniya; Irshad, Rasha; Goyal, Yamini; Rafat, Sahar; Siddiqui, Neha; Dev, Kapil; Husain, Mohammad; Ali, Shakir; Mohan, Anant; Syed, Mansoor Ali","journal":"Life Sciences","doi":"10.1016\/j.lfs.2019.116671","Title":"Life Sciences","H index":150.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Lungs are repeatedly divulged to several environmental stimuli including chemicals, dust, pollen along with numerous microorganisms. Prompt commencement of an inflammatory response is accomplished with the help of unique and conserved Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present on the surface of myeloid cells, lung epithelial cells and lymphoid tissue. PRRs comprise of Toll like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) and NOD like receptors (NLRs). To accomplish this, TLRs selectively recognize unique microbial patterns called Pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [3, 4] . non-immune cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells etc., and in various intercellular compartments like endosome and lysosome. Thus, PRRs can detect extracellular as well as intracellular pathogens. There are different types of PRRs and each type can recognize multiple pathogenic species that share a particular type of PRR and TLR is one among them [3] . Toll is a gene in fruit fly and toll-like proteins have been found in animals and are known as TLRs. Human TLRs; TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6 and TLR10 are expressed on cell surface, while TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are expressed on the membrane of intracellular vesicles [5] [6] [7] [8] . It was first suggested by studies on heat shock proteins [9] . These DAMPs originate from the host such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), hyaluronan and heat shock proteins as they are released from damaged tissues [5] [6] [7] , act as danger signals to alert the cells. Breakdown of extracellular matrix also act as damage signals. Similarly, ischemic injury results from temporary blood flow loss and oxygen supply. Some TLRs work in dimer form, either homodimer or heterodimer [12] . One of its intermediate domain (ID) is in connection with IL-1R-associated kinases 4 (IRAK4) involved in TLR signalling [15, 16] . However, TLR4 mediated MyD88 pathway activation and early phase activation of NF-\u03ba\u03b2 was also observed. Lower levels of TLR3, TLR5, TLR9 and higher levels of TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR8 have been found to be expressed on the surface of human alveolar macrophages [20] . These markers and anatomical locations can be used to distinguish different subsets of dendritic cells (DCs) [23] . TLR mediated responses are cell or tissue location dependent. This can be illustrated as -In the basal layers of airway epithelium, TLR2 and TLR4 are most relevant and maintained at low expression levels, but in inflamed cells and pathogenic infection, there is an upsurge in their MyD88, TIRAP  MyD88  TLR-3  Intracellular  CD14, TRIL  dsRNA  Viruses  TRIF  TRIF  Poly(I:C)  Synthetic analogue of dsRNA  TLR-4  Cell surface  CD14, MD-2  LPS, F-Prot  Bacteria  MyD88, TIRAF, TRIF, TRAM  MyD88, TRIF  RSV, VSV, Env-prot, MMTV others. Moreover, cellular activation of lung tissue can also be achieved via co-operative interactions with TLR expressing lymphoid cells. In case of a respiratory disease or allergic conditions, production of mucus and anti-microbial substances is the primitive response of epithelial cells [11, 17] . Boron has been found to equilibrate the LPS-CD14\/TLR4\/MD2 complex in a study, leading to release of pro inflammatory cytokines by M1 macrophages [37] . This IRAK-TRAF6 complex recruits and activates TAK1. It also gets activated directly by MyD88 and RIP1. IKK complex phosphorylates and subsequently degrade I\u03ba\u03b2 by proteasomes leading to release of transcription factor (TF) NF-\u03ba\u03b2 whereas activated MAPKs releases transcription factor AP1 by activating JNK1\/2 and p38. These TFs translocate into the nucleus and bind to their corresponding TF binding segment on the DNA to induce transcription of cytokines, chemokines, interferons, interleukins etc. In TRIF pathway, TRIF binds to TIR domain via bridge molecule TRAM. TLRs identify broad array of PAMPs [13, [39] [40] [41] . Identification of particular PAMPs by TLR initiate signalling cascade, upon recruitment of adaptor molecule (for example MyD88), leading to discharge of interferon, chemokines and host defence peptides; which initiate macrophage activation, stimulation of interferonstimulated genes (ISGs) and recruitment of neutrophils causing infected microbe killing [4, 42] . The gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus comprises numerous TLR PAMPs. After sinus and eye infection, TLR2 deficient mice signify increase in disease severeness and bio burden [45] suggesting that the TLR2 mediated sensing of the bacterial lipoproteins stimulates an immune response against Staphylococcus aureus. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), the causative pathogen of tuberculosis is present in aerosol particles. Invasive candidiasis is an infection caused by fungus Candida and is a life-threatening infection for immunosuppressed individuals. It has been reported that innate immunity is repressed by inducing a detrimental Treg and Th2 cells response in a mouse model infected with Candida albicans. Moreover, TLR4 deficient mice group primarily infected with less virulent Candida yeast and re-infected with Candida hyphae exhibited vulnerability to the infection. According to some reports, TLR2 plays redundant role against fungal infection in in vivo conditions. TLR2 deficient mice group is more vulnerable to the Candida fungal infection than the control mice group and secrete low level of chemokines and TNF-\u03b1. Viral nucleic acids like DNA is sensed by TLR9, dsRNA is sensed by TLR3, and ssRNA is sensed by TLR8-TLR7 [7] . TLR4 and TLR2 are the cell surface TLRs which detect viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion proteins are sensed by TLR4 and initiate secretion of cytokines. Furthermore, TLR2 mediated stimulation of IFN type-1 does not need nucleotides [60] . When TLR3 deficient mice group is infected with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), it exhibits depletion in IFN type-1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12p40 secretion and depletion in activation of Natural Killer and Natural Killer T cells. Due to this, TLR3 deficient mice group is more vulnerable to viral infection than control mice group [61] . ALI may be caused by bacterial or viral infection or could be a repercussion of non-infectious outrage including hyperoxia, trauma or environmental toxins such as ozone, heavy metals. TLR7 also plays a significant role in case of influenza infection. They are expressed on pDCs and mediate cell specific immune response via MyD88-dependent IFN induction. TLR3 is seen to be highly upregulated in human alveolar bronchial and epithelial cells during influenza infection. It has been observed that functional TLRs are expressed on both CF and non-CF lung epithelial cells but does not affect the susceptibility of chronic and gradual P. aeruginosa infection [96] . Recently, it has been shown that bacterial flagellin and expression of TLR5 plays a significant role in enhanced inflammatory responses, observed upon stimulation of IB3-1 cells (CF airway epithelial cells) with clinical Pseudomonas isolates as compared to cell line expressing wild type CFTR gene. TLR2 and TLR4 signal via MyD88 dependent and independent pathways, whereas TLR5 signals via MyD88 exclusively. Evidences have suggested that a typical innate immunity contributes to the disease pathogenesis [110] . Thus, it was also hypothesized that free radicals and oxidants of tobacco smoke may supersede innate immunity, resulting in cell necrosis and damage to lung tissue [111] . One of the studies has shown that the expression of TLR2 reduces in alveolar macrophages of smokers and COPD patients upon ex vivo ligand stimulation. However, expression of TLR4 and HBD-2 (an inducible antimicrobial peptide) is found to be increased in case of mild COPD. On the other hand, advanced COPD reduces their levels of expression [118] . An extensive research has been done on TLR4 function such as by Karimi et al., who showed TLR4 involvement in cigarette smoke-persuaded cytokine production [122] . Deficiency of TLR4 in mice results in pulmonary emphysema [111] . This shows disagreement with the Droemann et al. TLR9 deficient cells showed decrease production of CXCL8. This oligonucleotide inciting inflammation has been implied to be based on TNF\u03b1. On the other hand, LPS treatment can upregulate TLR9 expression in lungs of horses. The severity of response against S. pneumonia is enormously increased in case of MyD88 deficiency rather than single or combined deletion of TLR2 and TLR4 respectively [141] . COPD aggravations are also associated with non-typeable H. influenza (NTHi) infection. Although both TLR2 and TLR4 ligands are involved, but TLR4\/MyD88 is the most assertive immune signalling pathway involved in in vitro and in vivo bacterial clearance. Recent studies have shown that intranasal administration of Acinetobacter lwoffii F78 into pregnant mice provides protection against ovalbumin-induced asthma in the progeny. The protective effect depends upon maternal pattern of TLR expression and recognition of microbes by maternal TLRs during pregnancy primes the foetal lung environment for a later Th1 response against these antigens [150] . These cytokines leads to activation and polarization of ingenuous lymphocytes. Also, neurotoxin derived from eosinophil stimulates TLR2 activation, that eventually leads to enormous secretion of IL-6, IL-10 and Th2 polarization [152] . TLR4 and TLR9 are associated with wheezing, while TLR4 is related to secretion of allergen specific IgE [155] . It was shown that MyD88 deficient mice infected with C. pneumonia exhibited reduced cytokine and chemokine expression, deferred recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, and inability to clear lung bacterium resulting in chronic inflammation and high mortality [158] . M. pneumoniae infection leads to hypersecretion of airway mucin and upregulation of TLR2. However, TLR2 is inhibited during allergic inflammation caused by M. pneumoniae infection, along with reduced production of IL-6 and other mediators, needed for bacterial clearance [161] . Antibiotic treatments are highly effective in treating asthmatic patients with M. pneumoniae infections as they improve their pulmonary function and are suggestive of the contributions of bacterial interactions with the host immune system in asthma aggravations and mortality [162, 163] . Other PRRs are also involved in case of Streptococcus pneumonia infections as indicated by a study wherein there is clearance of high and low infectious doses of S. pneumonia with a moderate reduction in production of inflammatory mediators in TLR2 deficient mice (Cite reference [118, 121] ). Lung cancer is one of the foremost causes of cancer associated deaths all over the world. Inflammation is one of the hallmarks of cancer and tumor microenvironment also consists of cells that play highly significant roles in inflammation. TLRs present on cells of the innate immune system are activated upon recognition of specific ligands and induce host adaptive immune responses consequently. Thus, TLRs act as a double edged sword where on one side identify cancer specific antigens and activate innate responses and on the other side, promote latent chronic inflammation by inducing persistent adaptive responses which promote the process of tumorigenesis [174] [175] [176] . This chronic inflammation can lead to the proliferation of transformed cells that can evade the immune system in cancer conditions. As in other cases, TLRs expressed on dendritic cells play equally important roles in lung cancer too as upon TLR ligation and activation, they act as guards to look for antigens which are then presented and processed by T cells to generate adaptive immune responses. pDCs bind Treg through PD-1\/PD-L1 (immune checkpoint regulators) while TGF-\u03b2 (induced by TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9) stimulates production of Treg or Th17 [194, 195] . This discrepancy could be due to tissue specificity. Moreover, roles of other TLRs in B-cell derived immunity needs further elucidation. Tumor macrophages are polarized to M2 phenotype, upon TLR stimulation. These macrophages are termed as Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), expressing high levels of TLR2. CpG-ODN (type B) activation of TLR9, recruits an enormous amount of macrophages into the lungs of mice poised with tumor [200] . However, in case of prostate cancer, Poly I:C administration regresses tumor growth as activation of TLR3 can also result in apoptotic cascade [205] . However, reduced lung metastases have been observed due to NK cell activation upon administration of ligands of TLR3, TLR7\/8 [207] [208] [209] . Similarly, mast cells are also present in several tumor types and the activation of mast cell receptors and TLRs stimulate a number of growth stimulatory mediators and pro-angiogenic factors that enhance tumor proliferation. The role of TLR3 and TLR7 signalling has not been yet explored in lung carcinoma. Thus, VEGF may act as both pro-tumorigenic and antitumorigenic. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and chemokines such as IL-8, and ICAM-1 are released upon activation of TLRs present on endothelial cells, and bolsters the recruitment of leukocytes to the lung [221] . Immunosuppressive effects could also arise from activation of MDSCs mediated by MyD88 signalling. Extensive studies over the years have revealed a broad array of role played by TLRs in activation of innate immune response against various infectious agents and intrinsic molecules suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. Also, negative regulation of signalling pathways involving TLRs are also gaining interest as a novel therapeutic strategy. Apart from this, the aminoalkyl glucosaminide phosphates which are lipid A derivatives, are safe and effective adjuvants for influenza virus vaccine [235, 236] . Recently, a synthetic TLR4 agonist (ER803022) has been developed which shows potential against asthma in mouse models in a TLR-dependent MyD88 activation and IL-12\/IFN-\u03b3 production [238] . In addition, it stimulates T cell, B cell and natural killer cell accumulation in lungs of adult mice [242] . Therefore, TLR7 is thought to recuperate airway diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. CpG-ODN has shown encouraging results in clinical trials against asthma and allergic rhinitis as well [257] . RS-LPS acts as a TLR4 antagonist by inhibiting the induction of IkBz (gene NFKBIZ, a member of the NF-kB family, playing a significant role in functioning of epithelial cells) in bronchial epithelial cells, consequently leading to inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines -IL6 and GMCSF in a co-culture based study of bronchial epithelial cells and monocytes stimulated with house dust mite mix (HDM) [262] . One of the few synthesized antibodies that target TLRs is NI-0101, which is specific to TLR4 and blocks TLR4 dimerization. Eritoran TM (E5564) is a TLR4 antagonist that affects TLR4\/MD-2\/LPS complex formation is the most advanced TLR agonist and is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trial for treatment of sepsis [265] . However, continuous effort and holistic approaches would open newer ways for utilizing these compounds as medicinal agents in the near future. An extended exposure of lung to environmental aggravations and likely pathogens perpetuates the innate immune system to acquire a critical role in maintenance of lung tissue homeostasis. The acumens of this work have enabled us to predicate general principles associated with lung innate immunity. Secondly, infections (bacterial, fungal or viral) are the most prominent causes of prolonged inflammation in lung tissue, as represented by severe RSV infection preceding asthma development and progression of ARDS following severe influenza and pneumonia. Contemporary studies have demonstrated the tumor promoting as well as tumor suppressing roles of TLR signalling. Activation of TLRs on cells of tumor microenvironment can promote immune evasion by alterations of Tregs, thereby promoting tumor cell proliferation. Although, TLR activation plays a critical role in progression of lung inflammatory diseases, there are still many questions that have to be answered. Few TLR agonists and antagonists have been used a therapeutic modality in case of airway diseases but success has not yet been achieved due to several reasons involving dosage toxicity and inappropriate time and route of administration. Thus, more studies are needed to explore their potential as a therapeutic strategy. The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest associated with this manuscript."},{"Unnamed: 0":86,"Unnamed: 0.1":86,"doc_id":"7684a38d0d7d2c6e65a82b43ec39ffa64fda2297","title":"Age-and gender-related difference of ACE2 expression in rat lung","abstract":"Epidemiologic data suggested that there was an obvious predominance of young adult patients with a slight female proneness in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was very recently identified as a functional receptor for SARS virus and is therefore a prime target for pathogenesis and pharmacological intervention. Rats of both genders at three distinct ages (young-adult, 3 months; middle-aged, 12 months; old, 24 months) were evaluated to determine the characteristic of ACE2 expression in lung and the effect of aging and gender on its expression. ACE2 was predominantly expressed in alveolar epithelium, bronchiolar epithelium, endothelium and smooth muscle cells of pulmonary vessels with similar content, whereas no obvious signal was detected in the bronchiolar smooth muscle cells. ACE2 expression is dramatically reduced with aging in both genders: young-adult vs. old P < 0.001 (by 78% in male and 67% in female, respectively) and middle-aged vs. old P < 0.001 (by 71% in male rats and 59% in female rats, respectively). The decrease of ACE2 content was relatively slight between young-adult and middle-aged groups (by 25% in male and 18% in female, respectively). Although there was no gender-related difference of ACE2 in young-adult and middle-aged groups, a significantly higher ACE2 content was detected in old female rats than male. In conclusion, the more elevated ACE2 in young adults as compared to aged groups may contribute to the predominance in SARS attacks in this age group. D","text_body":"The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the first known human homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is an important regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (Donoghue et al., 2000) . Since its discovery in 2000, ACE2 has been implicated in heart function (Crackower et al., 2002) , hypertension and diabetes (Tikellis et al., 2003) . Unexpectedly, it was very recently identified as a functional receptor for the coronavirus (CoV) that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), serving as the cellular entry point for the SARS virus . The receptor is therefore a prime target for pathogenesis and pharmacological intervention.\r\n SARS, an acute pulmonary syndrome characterized by an atypical pneumonia that results in progressive respiratory failure and death in close to 10% of infected individuals, is responsible for the first pandemic of the 21st century . SARS-CoV spreads mainly via the respiratory route (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Drosten et al., 2003; Fouchier et al., 2003) , and the lungs are the main targets (Ding et al., 2003) . The spike protein of the coronavirus (a surface glycoprotein) mediates coronavirus entry into receptor-bearing cells, after which viral replication begins in the cytoplasm . Interestingly, the epidemiologic data of SARS suggested that there was an obvious predominance of young adult patients in SARS attacks. The largest outbreak of SARS struck Beijing in spring 2003 and about 2521 cases of probable SARS occurred. Attack rates were highest in those 20 -39 years of age (mean age 33), which account for 53.0% (Liang et al., 2004) . The age-specific attack rates of SARS were supported by other outbreaks of SARS (Zhao et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Hsu et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003; Booth et al., 2003) . Some of these data also showed a slight female proneness for SARS attacks. It seems likely that aging and gender might be implicated in SARS infection susceptibility. Thus, it can be hypothesized that age-or gender-related difference of ACE2 expression in lung tissue might contribute to different pathological processes in SARS-CoV attacks. In this study rats of both genders at three distinct ages (3 months indicates young-adult, 12 months middle-age, 24 months old) are evaluated for the characteristic of ACE2 expression in lung tissue and the effect of aging and gender on its expression, which may be helpful for the elucidation of the pathogenesis and future treatment options for SARS.\r\n Healthy male and female Sprague Dawley rats were purchased from the Animal Experimental Center of Zhejiang Medical Research Institute. Upon arrival, rats were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility and kept on a 12-h light, 12h dark cycle at 22 -C. Water and food were available ad libitum to all animals. Experiments were completed taking into account the entire age-scale encompassing the young adult, middleaged and the old. Six groups of ten SD rats were used, at three ages of both genders: 3, 12 and 24 months to represent different stages in early, middle and later life of rats (Smith et al., 1995; Mendelson and Bergmann, 2000; Sniecinski and Liu, 2004; Kotz et al., 2005) .\r\n The rats were killed by an intraperitoneal overdose of sodium pentobarbital. The lungs were rapidly removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogon. Frozen tissues were transferred to a \u00c0 80 -C freezer until processed. At least three tissue blocks were examined per case from different lung regions, in both immunohistochemical study and Western blotting. The results were the mean value of three measures. All animal procedures were in accordance with guidelines set by Animals Research Committee of School of Medicine, Zhejiang University.\r\n Immunohistochemistry staining for ACE2 was performed as outlined below. Frozen sections of rat lung were cut at sixmicrometer thickness, mounted on charged slides, fixed in cold acetone (Sigma), and immersed in 3% (vol\/vol) hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase. A 1 : 2000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-ACE2 (Millenium Pharmaceuticals) (Donoghue et al., 2000) was applied in 5%BSA\/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Specific staining was detected with the standard ABC (avidin -biotin complex) method. Briefly, slides were incubated for 20 min with the secondary antibody (Amersham) at a concentration of 1 \/ 250. The Vectastain ABC system (Vector Laboratories) was then applied for 20 min. After thorough washing, the final detection step was carried out with the use of 3,3V -diaminobenzidine (Sigma) as the chromogen. Sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. For the negative control, the primary antibody was replaced with normal rabbit sera (Jingmei Biotech) or PBS. These control sections do not reveal any staining (Fig. 1C ). Fig. 1 . The immunohistochemical analysis of ACE2 expression in normal rat lung. A: Positive staining for ACE2 in alveolar epitheliums (empty arrowhead) and bronchiolar epitheliums (arrow), but no obvious signal in the bronchiolar smooth muscle cells (black arrowhead). B: ACE2 present in alveolar epithelial cells (type I black arrow and type II empty arrowhead) and capillary endothelium (black arrowhead) in larger magnification. C: Control section stained with normal rabbit serum instead of anti-ACE2 shows no staining in rat lung. Original magnification A and C, \u00c2400; B \u00c2 800.\r\n Rat lungs were quickly removed and minced with a scalpel blade, homogenized in buffer (10 mmol\/L HEPES, 150 mmol\/L NaCl, 1 mmol\/L EGTA, 5 mmol\/L MgCl 2 , and 0.02% NaN3, PH 7.4, containing 0.5 Ag \/mL pepstatin [Sigma], 0.25Ag \/mL leupeptin [Sigma], 50 Ag\/mL PMSF[Sigma]). The homogenates were then centrifuged at 1000 g (4 -C) for 30 min. Samples (50 Ag of total protein) was loaded and run on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate denaturing gel, and proteins were transblotted onto nitrocellulose filters (Santa Cruz) through the use of a transfer tank at 200 mA for 90 min in 4 -C. At the end of the transfer, the filters were blocked with 10% nonfat skim milk powder in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. The membrane was incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-ACE2 (1 : 2000, Millenium Pharmaceuticals) (Donoghue et al., 2000) and anti-hactin (1 : 2000, sigma) at a overnight at 4 -C in 1% BSA\/TBST. hactin was used as loading control. The following day, the blot was washed in 1% TBS\/Tween (3\u00c2 15 min) and then incubated in goat -anti-rabbit HRP antibody (1 : 500, Zhongshan Biotech, China) for 1 h at room temperature and washed (3 \u00c2 15 min TBST). Signal was detected using the ECL plus kit (Amersham). Exposed films of bands representing ACE2 protein were quantified on an Automated Imaging System (Kodak). Rabbit normal sera were used as negative controls. A molecular weight marker (Invitrogen) was used for estimation of the ACE2 molecular weight.\r\n Data were expressed in mean T SEM. The significance of aging difference among groups was determined by one-way ANOVA with SPSS version 10.0 software followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests. For comparisons gender difference between two groups, Student's t-tests were used. P < 0.05 was considered significant.\r\n Although it had been reported that ACE2 protein was expressed in bronchus and lung parenchyma as well as in the heart, kidney and gastrointestinal tract (Donoghue et al., 2000; Harmer et al., 2002; Hamming et al., 2004) , the histocytochemical characteristics of ACE2 in lung tissue has not been elucidated adequately.\r\n In immunohistochemical study, the major site of ACE2 protein was in alveolar type I epithelium, alveolar type II epithelium, bronchiolar epithelium, endothelium and smooth muscle cells of pulmonary vascular structure, whereas no obvious signal was detected in the bronchiolar smooth muscle cells. The ACE2 intensity of bronchiolar epithelium is similar to alveolar epithelium or endothelium of vascular structure (Fig. 1A, B) , whereas Hamming et al. reported that the ACE2 content was not similar in bronchial epithelial and alveolar epithelium (Hamming et al., 2004) .\r\n ACE2 expression in rat lung was quantified by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 , an approximately 90 kDa immunoreactive band was present and its content significantly diminishes with age in rat lung of both genders. The ACE2 content is dramatically reduced in old rats of both genders: young-adult vs. old P < 0.001 (by 78% in male and 67% in female, respectively) and middle-aged vs. old P < 0.001 (by 71% in male rats and 59% in female rats, respectively), as Fig. 2 . ACE2 protein content was decreased with age in rat lung tissue of both genders: male (A) and female (B). The amounts of ACE2 were determined by Western analysis as described in Methods section. h-actin was used as loading control. Values represent means T SEM (n = 10). 3 m, young-adult group (3 months); 12 m, middle-aged group(12 months); 24 m, old group (24 months). The sizes of the molecular weight markers are shown to the right and indicate the 100 kDa and 86 kDa proteins. **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001. compared to the 3-month and 12-month old groups (Fig. 2) . Compared with old rats, there is only a weak decrease of ACE2 content between young-adult and middle-aged groups (by 25% in male and 18% in female, respectively).\r\n The age-associated change in ACE2 protein content was also roughly shown in immunohistochemical analysis. A significant decline in the number of cells stained for this enzyme and the intensity of immunostaining in rat lung tissue was observed in both genders during the aging process (Fig. 3) .\r\n In order to see whether there was any gender-related difference in ACE2 expression during the aging process, we compared age-associated ACE2 content between male and female rats. The results showed that there was no significant difference in ACE2 content either between young male and female rats or between middle-aged male and female rats, but a significantly higher content was found in old female rats than male ( P < 0.05) (Fig. 4) . The content of ACE2 decreased by 67% and 78% in the lung of 24-month old female and male rats, respectively, as compared with 3-month old rats.\r\n In this study, the involvement of aging and gender in ACE2 protein expression in rat lung is explored for the first time. We assess three distinct ages (3, 12, and 24 months) and provide three major findings: 1) ACE2 is predominantly expressed in alveolar epithelium, bronchiolar epithelium, endothelium and smooth muscle cells of pulmonary vessels with similar content; whereas no obvious signal was detected in the bronchiolar smooth muscle cells. 2) There has been a significant agespecific decline of ACE2 expression in rat lung of both genders, especially during the later aging process. 3) Although the concentrations of ACE2 were similar between male and female rats in either young-adult group or middle-aged group, male rats seemed to experience more dramatic age-associated decrease in ACE2 expression than did female rats in lung tissue. Fig. 3 . Immunohistochemical staining of ACE2 in rat lung of both genders at three distinct ages: female young-adult (A), male young-adult (B), female middle-aged (C), male middle-aged (D), female old (E) and male old (F). Original magnification: \u00c2400.\r\n These data, although obtained from rats, may provide helpful clues to understanding the SARS pathogenesis, especially in lung tissue.\r\n SARS is spread via the respiratory tract and is mainly a lower respiratory tract disease, causing pulmonary lesions and respiratory distress (Ding et al., 2003) . Recent studies in an autopsy series using viral isolation, culture techniques, and in situ hybridization showed that SARS-CoV is present in alveolar epithelial cells and, to a lesser extent, macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells . The localization of ACE2 protein in human lung was detected very recently (Hamming et al., 2004) . The results from the present study are consistent with the previous findings about SARS pathology and the coronavirus histological distribution. But in our study ACE2 content in alveolar epithelial cells and bronchial epithelial cells are similar, while Hamming et al. identified that ACE2 content was weak in bronchial epithelial. Interestingly, compared with the smooth muscle cells of pulmonary vessels, there was no obvious positive deposits are detected in the bronchial smooth muscle cells. High levels of ACE2 are seen in endothelial cells, but viral infection has not been demonstrated extensively in these cells of human tissues in previous studies (Ding et al., 2003) . These differences might be a clue for disclosing the severe vasculitis without equivalent bronchiolar inflamma tion in SARS pathology. We could postulate that the efficiency of the virus replication is distinct in different respiratory cell types although the contents of ACE2 in these cell types are similar.\r\n Although SARS has attacked all age groups and both genders, the young adults seem to be more prone to SARS. The largest outbreak of SARS struck Beijing in spring 2003 and about 2521 cases of probable SARS occurred. Attack rates were highest in those 20 -39 years of age (mean age 33), which account for 53.0% (Liang et al., 2004) . The age-specific attack rates of SARS in Beijing support findings from other outbreaks of SARS. The mean age of affected patients is 28 years in Guangzhou (190 cases) (Zhao et al., 2003) , 39 years in Hongkong (138 cases) and 28 years in Singapore (20 cases) (Hsu et al., 2003) , whereas it was 45 years (154 cases) in Canada Booth et al., 2003) . The patients enrolled in the former 4 reports are all Chinese ethic, which might be related to the slight discrepancy between the data from Asia and from Canada. But the total tendency is obvious that age might be an independent factor for the risk of susceptibility to SARS. Considering that ACE2 serves as the cellular entry point for the SARS virus, agerelated difference of ACE2 expression might be related to the highest attack rates in the young adult. However, it is inconsistent with the high mortality in old patients in these reports. But the entry of virus into the alveolar pneumocytes in Fig. 4 .

Some reports showed the ratio of male to female in SARS patients is 0.58 : 1 (70 : 120) in Guangzhou, 0.8 : 1 (174 : 214) in Hongkong and 0.33 : 1 (5 : 15) in Singapore (Zhao et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Hsu et al., 2003) , but Liang et al. reported that male patients had similar rates as female patients in a large sample of 2521 cases of probable SARS in Beijing (Liang et al., 2004) . The slight female predominance of SARS patients in previous reports might be related to the increased likelihood of exposure among nurses in early clinical work without enough personal protection equipment.\r\n In summary, the study gives the profile of age-and genderrelated ACE2 expression in rat lung, and suggests that the more elevated ACE2 in young adults as compared to aged groups may contribute to the predominance in SARS attacks in this age group, although these data are based on animal studies with limited numbers.","sha":"7684a38d0d7d2c6e65a82b43ec39ffa64fda2297","publish_time":"2006-04-04","authors":"Xudong, Xie; Junzhu, Chen; Xingxiang, Wang; Furong, Zhang; Yanrong, Liu","journal":"Life Sciences","doi":"10.1016\/j.lfs.2005.09.038","Title":"Life Sciences","H index":150.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the first known human homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is an important regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (Donoghue et al., Since its discovery in 2000, ACE2 has been implicated in heart function (Crackower et al., The receptor is therefore a prime target for pathogenesis and pharmacological intervention.

This extracellular lipid reservoir is also uniquely susceptible by virtue of its direct and continuous exposure to environmental oxidants, inflammatory agents, and pathogens. Historically, the greatest attention has been focused on those biophysical features of surfactant that serve to reduce surface tension at the air-liquid interface. More recently, surfactant lipids have also been recognized as bioactive molecules that maintain immune quiescence in the lung but can also be remodeled by the inhaled environment into neolipids that mediate key roles in inflammation, immunity, and fibrosis. This review focuses on the roles in inflammatory and infectious lung disease of two classes of native surfactant lipids, glycerophospholipids and sterols, and their corresponding oxidized species, oxidized glycerophospholipids and oxysterols. We highlight evidence that surfactant composition is sensitive to circulating lipoproteins and that the lipid milieu of the alveolus should thus be recognized as susceptible to diet and common systemic metabolic disorders. We also discuss intriguing evidence suggesting that oxidized surfactant lipids may represent an evolutionary link between immunity and tissue homeostasis that arose in the primordial lung. Taken together, the emerging picture is one in which the unique environmental susceptibility of the lung, together with its unique extracellular lipid requirements, may have made this organ both an evolutionary hub and an engine for lipid-immune cross-talk.","text_body":"In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the susceptibility of surfactant lipids to metabolic and environmental stress and in the role that these bioactive small molecules play in immunity and inflammation. Structural features of surfactant glycerophospholipids (PLs) permit them both to interrupt pathogen interactions with the host and to \"sense\" and respond to environment-induced oxidative stress. In this review, after providing background on surfactant PLs and sterols and their modification during disease, we discuss emerging evidence that these lipids play a crucial role in inflammation and host defense and that their evolutionary emergence in the lung represents a crucial, intrinsic, and revealing link between metabolism and host defense.\r\n Surfactant is z90% lipid and 10% protein by weight (1, 2) . Surfactant lipid, in turn, is z80-85% PL, a class of lipids with a threecarbon glycerol backbone with a defining polar headgroup at the third carbon, or sn-3 position (either choline, serine, glycerol, inositol, or ethanolamine in series with a phosphate moiety), plus two acyl (fatty acid [FA] ) chains at sn-1 and sn-2 ( Figure 1 ). Within all PL headgroup classes, both acyl chains in principle can be either saturated (i.e., no double bonds, such as in palmitic acid), monounsaturated (i.e., one double bond, such as in oleic acid), or polyunsaturated (i.e., more than one double bond, such as in arachidonic acid), although the sn-1 FA is less commonly unsaturated than is the sn-2 FA. In addition to disrupting tight intermolecular packing, double bonds of unsaturated FAs make them susceptible to oxidative attack, both by environmental (e.g., ozone) and enzymatic (e.g., 12\/15 lipoxygenase, myeloperoxidase, NADPH oxidase) exposures. Oxidation yields complex mixtures of bioactive oxidized PL (oxPL) species, including some with fragmented FAs, such as 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POVPC) (Figure 1 ) (3) . More than 20 unique native unsaturated diacyl PL species have been documented in surfactant (4), including some with highly oxidizable polyunsaturated sn-2 FAs (e.g., 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-PC [PAPC]) (5) , with unsaturated acyl chains altogether present in .30% of surfactant PL (2, 6) .\r\n Surfactant PL, estimated to be at a remarkable concentration of z35-50 mg\/ml, is a composite of phosphatidylcholine (PC, z80%), phosphatidylglycerol (PG, z7-15%), and small quantities (,5% each) of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine (PS) (2, 7) . Approximately one-half of surfactant PC, thus the most abundant surfactant PL species overall, is dipalmitoyl-PC (DPPC) (i.e., PC with two palmitic acids) ( Figure 1) . Figure 1 . Representative structures of lipid species found in pulmonary surfactant. For glycerophospholipids and cardiolipin, fatty acyl side chains are depicted in pink, the glycerol backbone is shown in black, and polar head groups are located on the far right side of the structure. Structures shown were generated using the online structure drawing tools from LIPID MAPS (132) .\r\n It is thought that the tight intermolecular packing of DPPC, especially at endexpiration, is largely responsible for the surface tension-reducing activity of surfactant that guards against alveolar collapse (8) . The hydrophobic proteins, surfactant protein (SP)-B and SP-C, aid in this function, whereas hydrophilic SP-A and SP-D are thought primarily to have host defense functions (9) . Other PLs, such as PG and PI, as well as cholesterol, the major neutral lipid in surfactant (a surfactant lipid class also including small amounts of free FAs and mono-, di-, and, triglycerides), help enhance adsorption, spreading, and fluidity of the surfactant film (1). Although the PL composition of surfactant is well conserved across vertebrates, it is unlike that of either cell membranes or any other body fluid (10). For example, the concentration of even the minor surfactant PL, PG, estimated at z3 mg\/ml in humans (11), is not found at any other site in mammals, suggesting a key and perhaps unique evolutionary role for extracellular PLs in the alveolus. The synthesis and life cycle of surfactant have been well covered in recent comprehensive reviews (8, 9, 12) . In brief, surfactant PLs and SPs are synthesized in alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells, stored intracellularly in lamellar bodies (LBs), and secreted apically in response to catecholamines, purinoceptor agonists, and cell stretch. Extracellularly, surfactant can take multiple forms. LBs are thought to unravel and interact with SPs to form large aggregates including lattice-like tubular myelin, as well as a variety of multi-and monolayered surface films ( Figure 2 ). Surfactant PL is regulated precisely. Approximately one-half is recycled into ATII cells for resecretion or lysosomal degradation, whereas most of the remainder is internalized and degraded by alveolar macrophages (AMs). For example, experimental depletion of AMs in rats causes surfactant PL accumulation (13) . Interestingly, surfactant degradation is coupled to the maturity and immune competence of AMs. It is now well established that AM degradation of surfactant requires signaling by the maturation\/differentiation cytokine, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and downstream activation of the transcription factors PU.1, STAT5, and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (PPAR)-g (12, 14) . This is best exemplified by the rare disease pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, in which disrupted granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor signaling, most commonly caused by autoantibodies, is associated with surfactant accumulation and AM immune dysfunction (14) . However, the intriguing finding of increased AM \"foam cells\" (abnormal lipidladen AMs) in a wide range of human lung disorders (15) and rodent inhalational exposures (16, 17) suggests the provocative possibility that coordinate AM dysfunction and surfactant dysregulation may play a role in a final common pathway in the pathogenesis of common chronic lung diseases and environmental exposures.\r\n Whereas the intra-alveolar microenvironment is often considered in isolation from the systemic circulation, extensive evidence actually suggests that surfactant lipid is sensitive to systemic metabolic status. ATII cells have long been known to bind and take up lipoproteins in vitro, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and very LDL (VLDL), and to resecrete PLs bearing lipoprotein-derived FAs as well as lipoprotein-derived cholesterol ( Figure 2 ) (18) (19) (20) . ATII uptake and degradation of VLDL enhances PC synthesis through a mechanism involving activation of the rate-limiting PC-synthetic enzyme, cytidyltransferase (CCT) (19) . LDL and HDL also induce PC secretion (20) . Compatible with a model in which lipoproteins induce coordinated ATII release of PL and cholesterol through substrate delivery, radiolabeled lipoprotein cholesterol in an isolated perfused rat lung model was shown to be first incorporated into ATII LBs and then later released into the airspace together with PC of lipoprotein origin (21) . Remarkably, intravenously injected VLDL has been shown to cross the placenta and to be incorporated as increased PC in fetal ATII cells, likely through a mechanism involving CCT activation (22) . Surfactant cholesterol may be particularly dependent on systemic lipoproteins, because it has been estimated through in vivo labeling studies that 83% of cholesterol in the rat lung derives from uptake from the circulation (23) .\r\n Just as surfactant is sensitive to circulating lipoprotein status during health, so too is it modified during systemic metabolic disorders, although the full implications of this remain unclear.\r\n Hypertriglyceridemic apolipoprotein E-null mice, which have marked elevations in plasma VLDL, have increased alveolar PC content and increased CCT activity (22) . By contrast, oxidized LDL (oxLDL), a mediator that is increased in humans with atherosclerosis (24), reduces ATII synthesis of PC, likely through promoting CCT degradation (25) . oxLDL-derived oxysterols may further compromise ATII PC levels by inducing ERK-dependent inactivating phosphorylation of CCT (26) and by promoting basolateral efflux of PC via the lipid transporter ATP binding cassette (ABC)A1 (27) .\r\n Dietary perturbations have also been shown to have important effects on surfactant PLs. Rats with diet-induced hyperlipidemia have increased PG and reduced PE in surfactant associated with altered alveolar stability (28) , and mice fed a high-fat diet have increased free FAs and triacylglycerol in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (R. S. Summer, personal communication). Ethanol ingestion also increases surfactant triacylglycerol and free FAs in BALF, likely through enhancing their synthesis by ATII cells (29) , but reduces ATII synthesis of disaturated PC (30) . Interestingly, dietary n-3 polyunsaturated FAs are incorporated into surfactant PLs and AM membranes in the rat (31) . Furthermore, consistent with the possibility that systemic metabolic conditions may modify immune function within the alveolus via macrophage incorporation of remodeled surfactant, pulmonary surfactant from starved rats was shown to modify AM phagocytic function (32) . Taken together, studies such as these indicate that the alveolar lipid microenvironment may be influenced critically by common systemic metabolic conditions. Given that HDL also serves as the major vehicle for delivery of the antioxidant vitamin E to ATII cells (33) , it seems plausible that metabolic disorders with increased oxLDL and reduced\/dysfunctional HDL could conspire to alter both the composition and the oxidation status of native surfactant lipids.\r\n Significant changes in surfactant lipid composition have been documented in human lung diseases, in particular, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), interstitial lung disease, and pneumonia. In several studies of ARDS, decreases in PC and PG and large surfactant aggregates, and increases in protein, PI, PE, and PS have been associated with impairment in the surface tension-lowering properties of surfactant (34) (35) (36) . Pathogens and pathogen-associated molecules may drive some of these changes, because Pseudomonas aeruginosa and adenovirus Figure 2 . Roles of native and oxidized surfactant glycerophospholipids in inflammatory lung responses to the environment. The complex immune interactions that occur in the alveolus between native surfactant glycerophospholipids (PLs) and environmental agents are depicted. Surfactant PLs, including dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine (PAPC) are synthesized by alveolar epithelial type 2 cells and released as lamellar bodies that unravel to form the surfactant layer. Various lipids are depicted in the surfactant monolayer inset, but native surfactant is DPPC predominant. Inhaled agents and reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from host cells oxidize PAPC and PE into oxidized PLs (oxPLs), as shown. Native PLs antagonize delivery of pathogens and pathogen-associated molecules to cellular receptors, and oxPL species act on multiple receptors on alveolar macrophages, both promoting and suppressing inflammation. Plasma lipoproteins, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and very LDL (VLDL), deliver and receive lipids to\/from alveolar epithelial cells, influencing PL synthesis. ABCA1, ATP binding cassette A1 transporter; CCT, cytidyltransferase; EP2, prostaglandin E2 receptor; IAV, influenza A virus; KETE, 15-ketoeicosatetraenoic acid; MALP-2, macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2; MARCO, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure; Nrf2, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2; oxPAPC, oxidized PAPC; PEIPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-(5,6-epoxyisoprostane E2)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; SR-BI, scavenger receptor class B member I; TGF, transforming growth factor; TLR, Toll-like receptor.\r\n are both reported to reduce apical PC secretion from ATII cells by promoting ABCA1-dependent basolateral PC efflux (37, 38) , whereas LPS impairs DPPC synthesis by promoting degradation of acyl-coA:lysoPC acyltransferase I, an enzyme that remodels sn2-unsaturated PC into DPPC (39) . In ARDS and pneumonia, the palmitic acid content of PC is indeed reduced, with associated increases in unsaturated PC species, including PAPC (35, 36) , presumably rendering this PL much more susceptible to oxidation. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, reduced percentages of PC and PG, increased PI, and reductions in PC palmitic acid have also been noted (34, 40) . In the bleomycin rodent model of experimental lung fibrosis, significantly increased cholesterol and decreased PG have been found (16, 41) .\r\n Perhaps the most notable recent discovery in surfactant lipid dysregulation during lung disease has been the finding of abnormal accumulation during bacterial pneumonia of cardiolipin (CL), a PL with a unique tetra-acylated, di-PG-like structure that is normally restricted to the inner mitochondrial membrane (Figure 1 ) (42) . Ordinarily present at only low levels in surfactant, CL is markedly increased in tracheal aspirates of patients with pneumonia and in BALF of mice with bacterial pneumonia. This likely occurs because of CL from dead\/dying immune cells overwhelming the capacity of the CL importer, ATP8b1. Interestingly, increased CL suffices to recapitulate several hallmark features of pneumonia, including surfactant dysfunction, increased BALF protein, radiographic consolidation, and epithelial apoptosis (42) . The unique structure and mitochondrial localization of CL together may explain the susceptibility of this PL, when exposed extracellularly, to targeting by autoantibodies (i.e., anticardiolipin antibodies). It is intriguing to consider the possibility that abnormal accumulation of CL during pneumonia may underlie the apparent link between respiratory infection and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (43) .\r\n Although historically the greatest attention in surfactant science has been focused on surface tension properties (without doubt, a key evolutionary mandate that arose with tidal air breathing), a perhaps equally important requirement for successful gas exchange in the lung is the need to titrate immune responses to inhaled pathogens and pathogen-derived molecules. Over the past several years, several mechanisms have been identified by which native surfactant PLs attenuate inflammation and modify the host response to virus and bacteria (Figure 2 ). These findings, of course, raise the interesting yet unanswered question as to whether surfactant lipid modifications induced by diet, systemic metabolic disorders, and\/or lung disease causally modify lung phenotypes in humans by modulating inflammation and\/or host defense in vivo.\r\n Perhaps the best-described interaction of native surfactant PLs with the innate immune response is the capacity of anionic PLs (i.e., PG, PI, PS, and CL) to interrupt the Toll-like receptor (TLR)4-mediated immune response to bacterial LPS, itself a glycolipid with an anionic PL-like core structure. This competitive antagonism almost certainly arises from structural similarity that dictates common thermodynamic requirements for protein binding and transfer through biological fluids. LPS is transferred by extracellular LPS-binding protein (LBP) to a cellassociated protein, CD14, which then relays LPS to its receptor complex, a heterodimer of TLR4 with the lipid-binding coreceptor, MD2 (44) . Although LBP and CD14 are well known as LBPs to immunologists, both also competitively bind a variety of host PLs and cooperate in homeostatic PL trafficking; for example, LBP transfers PI and PS to CD14 (45) . Furthermore, LBP is homologous to the lipoprotein-remodeling serum protein, phospholipid transfer protein, which is known to also transfer LPS and regulate its signaling (44) , perhaps suggesting that the innate immune response and host PL homeostasis have common evolutionary roots. This intriguing possibility becomes less surprising when one realizes that certain PLs, including PG and CL, are relatively abundant in bacterial membranes, but scarce in mammalian tissues (with the interesting exception of PG in surfactant) (46) .\r\n PI and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PG (POPG), the most prevalent PG species in human surfactant, (10) have been shown to inhibit macrophage proinflammatory responses to LPS by interfering with the LBP-CD14-TLR4\/MD2 relay pathway at multiple sites. Both PLs competitively inhibit the binding of LPS to LBP and CD14 (11, (45) (46) (47) , although one report suggests that PI and LPS have different binding sites on CD14 (11) . POPG also competes with LPS for binding to MD-2 (11) . In addition, POPG inhibits TLR2-dependent inflammatory responses, including those triggered by the respiratory pathogen Mycoplasma pneumoniae (48), whereas it does not inhibit responses to TLR3 (dsRNA), TLR5 (flagellin), or TLR9 (CpG DNA) ligands (11, 46) . CL, in which the tetra-acylated structure is somewhat similar to that of TLR4-inhibitory tetra-acyl bacterial LPS species, also inhibits macrophage responses to LPS; this may occur through the competition for binding to LBP (47) and MD2 (49) . Several reports indicate that PC is inert at inhibiting the macrophage LPS response or competing for LPS protein binding (11, (45) (46) (47) , whereas others indicate that DPPC inhibits LPS-induced cytokine production by airway epithelial cells and monocytes, potentially through incorporating into the plasma membrane and affecting membrane fluidity (50-52). Intratracheal DPPC supplementation in mice attenuates lung inflammation induced by intravenous LPS (11) . DPPC exerts additional antiinflammatory and protective actions, inducing prostaglandin E2 in monocytes (53), down-regulating the monocyte respiratory burst (51, 54) , and protecting lung epithelial cells from invasion, lysis, and cytokine production induced by Group B Streptococci (55, 56).\r\n Complex interactions have been noted between surfactant PLs and viruses. DPPC promotes adenoviral entry into epithelial cells by binding virus and serving as a vehicle for receptor-independent penetration into the cell (57) . Exogenous PS also promotes cell entry by enveloped viruses, potentially through promoting fusion (58) . Interestingly, PS in the poxvirus envelope promotes viral infectivity, perhaps through apoptotic cell mimicry (59) , although another report indicates that PG incorporation by the viral envelope also promotes infectivity (60) . On the other hand, potent antiviral activities have been shown for both POPG and PI. POPG binds respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and competes with RSV binding to CD14, thereby blocking viral attachment to epithelial cells, cytopathic effects, cytokine induction, and plaque formation in vitro (61) . Remarkably, intranasal treatment of mice with POPG markedly reduces the lung viral titers and tissue injury induced by RSV (61, 62) . Similar in vitro and in vivo protective effects are seen for POPG with influenza A virus (63) and for PI with RSV (64) . Taken together, these findings suggest that some PLs render the airway epithelium susceptible to virus, whereas others may be protective by raising the threshold for infection.\r\n By comparison, much less is known about the effect of surfactant lipids on bacterial infection. Free FAs in rat surfactant have been shown to kill Pneumococcus and other gram-positive bacteria through membranolytic detergent-like activity (65), whereas exogenous PC promotes intracellular growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages (66) . Diet-induced hypercholesterolemia is also associated with compromised pulmonary host defense against M. tuberculosis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (67, 68) . The interesting possibility that surfactant lipid locally programs the phenotype of alveolar phagocytes, including membrane composition and immune functions, has been suggested by some adoptive transfer and in vitro exposure studies (69, 70) .\r\n Neolipids with a Key Role in Lung Disease oxPLs, formed by chemical or enzymatic oxidation of the double bonds of unsaturated PLs such as PAPC (Figure 1) , have long been studied in the cardiovascular field for their inflammatory effects, in particular, the induction of monocyte adhesion to endothelium (71) . Discordant and at times seemingly contradictory effects on inflammation have been reported for oxPLs (3) . This likely derives in part from the fact that methods for in vitro oxidation of PAPC are poorly standardized, and oxidized PAPC (oxPAPC) is actually a highly complex mixture of lipids with widely varying bioactivity (3) . Investigations of defined oxPL species have benefitted from improved specificity, but likely at the expense of uncertain physiologic relevance. The remarkably pleiotropic activities of oxPLs on multiple receptors, including the platelet-activating factor receptor, prostaglandin receptors, scavenger receptors, TLRs, PPARs, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, as well as intracellular signals and transcription factors, were comprehensively reviewed recently (3, 72) . In aggregate, these studies suggest a paradigm in which unsaturated PLs effectively serve as biosensors and ultimately as second messengers of chemical and biological oxidant stress.\r\n Several pro-oxidant exposures have now been shown to drive the formation of oxPLs in pulmonary surfactant ( Figure 2 ). In vitro exposure of human BALF to ozone directly induces multiple PC and PG oxidation products (4) . In vivo exposure of mice to a wide variety of airway challenges, including cigarette smoke, particulate matter 2.5, acid, H1N1 influenza A virus, and H5N1 avian influenza virus also increases oxPAPC species and 1-palmitoyl-2-(9'-oxo-nonanoyl)glycerophosphocholine (PON-GPC) in airspace fluid (73) (74) (75) (76) (77) . Direct infection of pulmonary epithelial cells with influenza A induces their production and release of POVPC and other oxPAPC subspecies (78) . Indeed, oxPAPC has been found in the lungs of patients with H5N1 avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome infections, as well as in experimental animal models of anthrax, monkey pox, and Yersinia pestis infection, suggesting that oxPAPC may be induced as a common response to a wide range of severe pulmonary infections (76) . Increased numbers of oxPAPC-laden AMs have also been documented in noninfectious human interstitial lung diseases, including desquamative interstitial pneumonitis and usual interstitial pneumonia (79) . By contrast, CL and PS, but not PC, are selectively oxidized in the lungs in response to singlewalled carbon nanotubes, irradiation, and hyperoxia, likely reflecting cytochrome C-driven oxidation occurring during apoptosis (80) (81) (82) .\r\n Several protective antioxidants, including urate, ascorbate, glutathione, and atocopherol, are present in the airway but these may be overwhelmed\/depleted by acute environmental challenges, such as ozone (83) . Redundant clearance mechanisms for oxPLs from the lung, including the lipid efflux transporter, ABCG1, as well as macrophage receptor with collagenous structure, a scavenger receptor, also exist (84, 85) . ABCG1dependent clearance of accumulated oxPLs from AMs is induced by HDL, an event that is likely deficient in systemic metabolic disorders with defective HDL function (86) . Pulmonary expression of macrophage receptor with collagenous structure is, however, up-regulated in mice fed a highfat diet (87) .These two mechanisms, taken together, suggest that pathways for oxPL clearance from the lung may be regulated differentially by systemic oxidant burden and metabolic status. Important proinflammatory roles have been identified recently for oxPAPC in the lung. In a landmark paper, Imai and colleagues reported that multiple chemical and infectious exposures induce NADPH oxidase-dependent production of oxPAPC in the murine lung, which then activates a pathway through TLR4 and its adaptor, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-b, to cytokine-dependent acute lung injury (76) . A second group has shown that oxPAPC, formed in the lung during influenza A virus infection, induces TLR4dependent, CD14-independent proinflammatory lung injury that can be suppressed by the TLR4 antagonist, eritoran (77) . oxPAPC has also been reported to induce TLR2-dependent cytokines on intraperitoneal injection (88) , and PON-GPC has been shown to induce cytotoxicity and cytokine production in epithelial cells in the low nanomolar range (89) . Seemingly at odds with these reports are several others showing that oxPAPC attenuates the induction of proinflammatory genes by TLR4 and TLR2 ligands (3, (90) (91) (92) . The former effect may arise from oxPAPC blocking interactions of LPS with LBP and CD14 (3) or MD2 (90), or by disrupting lipid raft microdomains in which TLR4 is activated (92) , potentially through sphingomyelinase activation (93) . Reports also differ on the question of whether oxPAPC inhibits ligand-induced activation of other TLRs, such as TLR9 (90, 91, 94) . Taken together, the issue of oxPAPC activity at TLR4 may be reconciled by a model in which oxPAPC has partial agonistic activity, because it has been shown that the LPS-inhibitory activity of oxPAPC occurs at a concentration z10-fold lower than proinflammatory activity (95) . In such a model, low-level oxPAPC might serve as a feedback brake on bacteria-induced inflammation and injury, whereas sites of localized or intense oxPAPC accumulation might drive dysregulated disease responses.\r\n Several specific oxPL species have now been identified that are antiinflammatory and\/or immunosuppressive through mechanisms other than TLR ligand antagonism ( Figure 2 ). 1-palmitoyl-2-(5,6-epoxyisoprostane E2)-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine (PEIPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-(5,6-epoxyisoprostane A2)-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine (PECPC) are oxPAPC subspecies that structurally and functionally mimic the proresolving prostaglandin 15-deoxy-D12,14-prostaglandin J2 (94) . Like 15-deoxy-D12,14-prostaglandin J2, PECPC elicits antiinflammatory effects via the transcription factor nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (94) . PEIPC also induces antiinflammatory effects in macrophages, including reduced tumor necrosis factor-a and increased IL-10 production, via activation of the prostaglandin E2 receptor (96) . PEIPC induced during Mycobacterial infection inhibits DC activation of T cells, which suggests possible adverse effects on host defense (86) . PON-GPC, which is induced in the lung by cigarette smoke, is also reported to inhibit the bactericidal function of macrophages (74) , whereas intratracheal delivery of oxPAPC impairs AM phagocytosis and bacterial clearance in vivo (75) . 15-Ketoeicosatetraenoic acid-PE, a product of 15-lipoxygenase action on PE that is elevated in the BALF of patients with cystic fibrosis, and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid-PE were recently identified as antiinflammatory oxPLs that activate PPAR-g (97) . POVPC also promotes M2 polarization and TGFb expression by AMs, inducing pulmonary fibrosis in mice (16) .\r\n Compared with that which is known about PLs and oxPLs, far less is known about the regulation and function of cholesterol and oxysterols in lung biology.\r\n As is the case for cholesterol in lipid raft membrane microdomains, in surfactant, cholesterol is thought to improve the fluidity\/spreading of tightly packed disaturated PLs. Consequently, surfactant cholesterol levels must be regulated tightly, because excess cholesterol, such as can occur with serum leakage during acute lung injury, impairs surfactant function (98) (99) (100) . Pulmonary cholesterol derives largely from plasma lipoproteins rather than in situ synthesis (23) and is thought to be cleared back into the plasma compartment by interactions of the lipid efflux transporters ABCG1 and ABCA1 with plasma HDL (101) (102) (103) , as well as by diffusional efflux of cholestenoic acid, a hydrophilic oxysterol produced by the action of sterol-27-hydroxylase on cholesterol in AMs (104) .\r\n Cholesterol can be oxidized either on its ring structure or on its side chain ( Figure 1 ). Analogous to the case for unsaturated PLs, ring oxidation, commonly occurring at the carbon 5-6 double bond, occurs from direct attack by reactive oxygen species. Ozone induces formation of the cytotoxic ring oxysterol 5b,6bepoxycholesterol in pulmonary surfactant and bronchial epithelial cells (105, 106) . By contrast, side-chain oxysterols are typically enzymatic products (e.g., 25hydroxycholesterol [25HC] is produced by cholesterol-25-hydroxylase [Ch25h] action on cholesterol). Of interest, increases in both 25HC and 27HC are found in the sputum of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and are inversely related to lung function and directly related to inflammatory measures, suggesting roles in pathogenesis (107, 108) .\r\n In recent years, a profusion of papers have reported intriguing, pleiotropic biologic activities of 25HC on multiple immune receptors, with important effects on inflammation and host defense. Ch25h is an interferon-stimulated gene, and thus LPS, poly(I:C), viruses, and interferons all up-regulate Ch25h and increase production and release of 25HC in macrophages (109) (110) (111) . Ch25h and 25HC are induced in the mouse lung in response to systemic (112) and inhaled (M. B. Fessler, personal communication) LPS challenge. Both pro-and antiinflammatory actions of 25HC have been identified. On the one hand, 25HC augments poly(I:C)induced cytokines in airway epithelial cells via effects on nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) (110) and amplifies TLR-induced gene induction in macrophages via enhancing recruitment of AP-1 to the promoters of proinflammatory genes (111) . As a consequence, Ch25h-null mice have reduced lung injury and mortality after pulmonary challenge with influenza A (111) . 25HC and some other side-chain oxysterols also promote neutrophilic inflammation by chemoattracting neutrophils via ligation of CXCR2 (113) . On the other hand, 25HC has also been shown to suppress IL-1-dependent inflammation by inhibiting transcription of IL-1b and activation of IL-1b-processing inflammasome complexes (114) . As a consequence, Ch25h-null mice have exacerbated mortality after systemic LPS challenge (114) . 25HC also reduces IgA levels in the lung and other mucosal sites, in part by suppressing B-cell proliferation and class switch recombination (112) . 7a,25-dihydroxycholesterol, a product of secondary oxidation of 25HC by the enzyme Cyp7b, was also shown recently to play a critical role in systemic humoral immunity through positioning B cells and dendritic cells in the spleen via the G-protein-coupled receptor, Ebi2 (115) (116) (117) (118) (119) . Finally, 25HC and several other side-chain oxysterols are natural agonists of liver X receptor, a nuclear receptor that has potent antiinflammatory actions in the lung and elsewhere through the inhibition of NF-kB (120, 121) . This indicates that 25HC has remarkably complex cell-and contextdependent effects on inflammation, representing a direct and intriguing link between cholesterol metabolism and immunity.\r\n In addition to its effects on inflammation, 25HC has been shown recently to have potent antiviral effects. 25HC inhibits the growth of a broad range of enveloped viruses in cultured cells (122, 123) . This may occur through blocking viral fusion (122) or alternatively through inhibiting postentry viral replication (123) , potentially by activation of the integrated stress response (124) . Ch25h-null mice are thus more susceptible to MHV68 lytic infection, whereas administration of 25HC to humanized mice suppresses HIV replication (122) . Among naturally occurring oxysterols, 25HC is uniquely synthesized and secreted by macrophages in response to interferons and virus (123) , suggesting a potentially critical role in pulmonary host defense.\r\n Is There an Evolutionary Connection among Death, Fat, Immunity, and the Inhaled Environment? oxPLs and oxysterols are ancient and ubiquitous modified-self autoantigens. Apoptotic cells display oxPLs on their surface that are bound by C-reactive protein and also recognized by natural (germline-encoded) antibodies (125) (126) (127) . Innate B cells (i.e., B1 B cells), in particular, produce natural antibodies that recognize oxPAPC species on the surface of apoptotic cells and regulate cell corpse clearance by macrophages. Remarkably, these \"T15\/E06\" idiotype natural antibodies also recognize phosphocholine in the capsule polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae and some other bacteria and are important in survival during S. pneumoniae infection (128) . It has been proposed that these anti-oxPL B1-cell clones have been preserved through natural selection for their importance in both host defense and tissue homeostasis (126) .\r\n Interestingly, emerging evidence suggests that the lung, subject as it is to exposure to bacteria, oxPL-inducing environmental oxidants, and apoptotic leukocytes, may have a central and perhaps unique role in coordinating the regulation of lipid homeostasis and innate immunity. Abcg1-null mice have a marked accumulation of cholesterol, PL, and oxPAPC in their lungs, likely because of impaired clearance by macrophages (85, 101, 102) . In parallel with this lungselective lipid accumulation, na\u00efve Abcg1null mice have marked recruitment of leukocytes to their lungs (102, 129, 130) . In particular, excess POVPC and other oxidized lipid species attract T15\/E06producing B1 cells to the Abcg1-null lung and drive their proliferation there, inducing a lung niche-specific autoimmune expansion that boosts systemic levels of natural anti-oxPAPC antibodies (85) . Taken together, these findings suggest, intriguingly, that steadystate lipid and immune homeostasis are intrinsically linked, and that the lung, in particular, may represent a unified site for lipid-based programming and expansion of innate immune responses. T15\/E06 antibody not only regulates apoptotic cell clearance (125) , but has also been shown to therapeutically block oxPAPC-induced proinflammatory responses by lung macrophages (76) as well as impairment of macrophage host defense functions induced by oxPAPC and cigarette smoke-conditioned BALF (75) . Given that increased native T15\/E06 antibody has been detected in the lung after the induction of experimental asthma (131) , it is intriguing to speculate that this natural antibody may be acutely induced in the lung in response to environment-induced oxidative stress and then serve to regulate inflammation and oxidative stress. The unique environmental susceptibility of the lung, together with its unique extracellular lipid requirements, may have made this organ both an evolutionary hub and an engine for lipid-immune cross-talk.\r\n Native surfactant lipids have been recognized recently as key regulators of lung inflammation that occupy a common ground at the intersection of tissue homeostasis, host defense, and biophysics. The unsaturated bonds of PLs and cholesterol serve as biosensors of oxidative stress and endow these lipids with the flexibility to be transformed into complex, pleiotropic effectors and feedback regulators of the host response to environmental insult. Evolutionarily, the environmental susceptibility of the alveolar lipid milieu may have created selection pressure for the development of natural antibodies and other arms of the innate immune system. Although historically the lung has not been widely considered a target organ in metabolic syndromes, the alveolar microenvironment should be recognized as susceptible to dyslipidemia and other systemic disorders. It is expected that increased consideration of the lung in this light may lead to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in lung disease and to a better appreciation of the lung as a metabolic organ. n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.","sha":"a907f4f25e87d46bfa30e0a6931f11bb7563f8d8","publish_time":"2016-05-01","authors":"Fessler, Michael B.; Summer, Ross S.","journal":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","doi":"10.1165\/rcmb.2016-0011ps","Title":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","H index":147.0,"transmission_indicator":true,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the susceptibility of surfactant lipids to metabolic and environmental stress and in the role that these bioactive small molecules play in immunity and inflammation. Structural features of surfactant glycerophospholipids (PLs) permit them both to interrupt pathogen interactions with the host and to \"sense\" and respond to environment-induced oxidative stress. Surfactant is z90% lipid and 10% protein by weight (1, 2) . Within all PL headgroup classes, both acyl chains in principle can be either saturated (i.e., no double bonds, such as in palmitic acid), monounsaturated (i.e., one double bond, such as in oleic acid), or polyunsaturated (i.e., more than one double bond, such as in arachidonic acid), although the sn-1 FA is less commonly unsaturated than is the sn-2 FA. More than 20 unique native unsaturated diacyl PL species have been documented in surfactant (4), including some with highly oxidizable polyunsaturated sn-2 FAs (e.g., 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-PC [PAPC]) (5) , with unsaturated acyl chains altogether present in .30% of surfactant PL (2, 6) . Representative structures of lipid species found in pulmonary surfactant. Structures shown were generated using the online structure drawing tools from LIPID MAPS (132) . Although the PL composition of surfactant is well conserved across vertebrates, it is unlike that of either cell membranes or any other body fluid (10). Extracellularly, surfactant can take multiple forms. For example, experimental depletion of AMs in rats causes surfactant PL accumulation (13) . Interestingly, surfactant degradation is coupled to the maturity and immune competence of AMs. ATII cells have long been known to bind and take up lipoproteins in vitro, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and very LDL (VLDL), and to resecrete PLs bearing lipoprotein-derived FAs as well as lipoprotein-derived cholesterol ( Figure 2 ) (18) (19) (20) . LDL and HDL also induce PC secretion (20) . Hypertriglyceridemic apolipoprotein E-null mice, which have marked elevations in plasma VLDL, have increased alveolar PC content and increased CCT activity (22) . Dietary perturbations have also been shown to have important effects on surfactant PLs. Pathogens and pathogen-associated molecules may drive some of these changes, because Pseudomonas aeruginosa and adenovirus Figure 2 . Roles of native and oxidized surfactant glycerophospholipids in inflammatory lung responses to the environment. Surfactant PLs, including dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine (PAPC) are synthesized by alveolar epithelial type 2 cells and released as lamellar bodies that unravel to form the surfactant layer. Inhaled agents and reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from host cells oxidize PAPC and PE into oxidized PLs (oxPLs), as shown. In ARDS and pneumonia, the palmitic acid content of PC is indeed reduced, with associated increases in unsaturated PC species, including PAPC (35, 36) , presumably rendering this PL much more susceptible to oxidation. Although historically the greatest attention in surfactant science has been focused on surface tension properties (without doubt, a key evolutionary mandate that arose with tidal air breathing), a perhaps equally important requirement for successful gas exchange in the lung is the need to titrate immune responses to inhaled pathogens and pathogen-derived molecules. PI and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PG (POPG), the most prevalent PG species in human surfactant, (10) have been shown to inhibit macrophage proinflammatory responses to LPS by interfering with the LBP-CD14-TLR4\/MD2 relay pathway at multiple sites. CL, in which the tetra-acylated structure is somewhat similar to that of TLR4-inhibitory tetra-acyl bacterial LPS species, also inhibits macrophage responses to LPS; this may occur through the competition for binding to LBP (47) and MD2 (49) . Several reports indicate that PC is inert at inhibiting the macrophage LPS response or competing for LPS protein binding (11, (45) (46) (47) , whereas others indicate that DPPC inhibits LPS-induced cytokine production by airway epithelial cells and monocytes, potentially through incorporating into the plasma membrane and affecting membrane fluidity (50-52). Intratracheal DPPC supplementation in mice attenuates lung inflammation induced by intravenous LPS (11) . DPPC exerts additional antiinflammatory and protective actions, inducing prostaglandin E2 in monocytes (53), down-regulating the monocyte respiratory burst (51, 54) , and protecting lung epithelial cells from invasion, lysis, and cytokine production induced by Group B Streptococci (55, 56). Exogenous PS also promotes cell entry by enveloped viruses, potentially through promoting fusion (58) . On the other hand, potent antiviral activities have been shown for both POPG and PI. Similar in vitro and in vivo protective effects are seen for POPG with influenza A virus (63) and for PI with RSV (64) . By comparison, much less is known about the effect of surfactant lipids on bacterial infection. Discordant and at times seemingly contradictory effects on inflammation have been reported for oxPLs (3) . Increased numbers of oxPAPC-laden AMs have also been documented in noninfectious human interstitial lung diseases, including desquamative interstitial pneumonitis and usual interstitial pneumonia (79) . By contrast, CL and PS, but not PC, are selectively oxidized in the lungs in response to singlewalled carbon nanotubes, irradiation, and hyperoxia, likely reflecting cytochrome C-driven oxidation occurring during apoptosis (80) (81) (82) . Pulmonary expression of macrophage receptor with collagenous structure is, however, up-regulated in mice fed a highfat diet (87) .These two mechanisms, taken together, suggest that pathways for oxPL clearance from the lung may be regulated differentially by systemic oxidant burden and metabolic status. Reports also differ on the question of whether oxPAPC inhibits ligand-induced activation of other TLRs, such as TLR9 (90, 91, 94) . Cholesterol can be oxidized either on its ring structure or on its side chain ( Figure 1 ). By contrast, side-chain oxysterols are typically enzymatic products (e.g., 25hydroxycholesterol [25HC] is produced by cholesterol-25-hydroxylase [Ch25h] action on cholesterol). In recent years, a profusion of papers have reported intriguing, pleiotropic biologic activities of 25HC on multiple immune receptors, with important effects on inflammation and host defense. Both pro-and antiinflammatory actions of 25HC have been identified. On the one hand, 25HC augments poly(I:C)induced cytokines in airway epithelial cells via effects on nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) (110) and amplifies TLR-induced gene induction in macrophages via enhancing recruitment of AP-1 to the promoters of proinflammatory genes (111) . Is There an Evolutionary Connection among Death, Fat, Immunity, and the Inhaled Environment? oxPLs and oxysterols are ancient and ubiquitous modified-self autoantigens. Taken together, these findings suggest, intriguingly, that steadystate lipid and immune homeostasis are intrinsically linked, and that the lung, in particular, may represent a unified site for lipid-based programming and expansion of innate immune responses. T15\/E06 antibody not only regulates apoptotic cell clearance (125) , but has also been shown to therapeutically block oxPAPC-induced proinflammatory responses by lung macrophages (76) as well as impairment of macrophage host defense functions induced by oxPAPC and cigarette smoke-conditioned BALF (75) . n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org."},{"Unnamed: 0":88,"Unnamed: 0.1":88,"doc_id":"395bb208b08adcb4d1a5610242ccc07b2e0e265b","title":"Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Gene Expression in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","abstract":"Although most cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occur in smokers, only a fraction of smokers develop the disease.

Although cigarette smoking is the major environmental risk factor and is present in greater than 80% of patients with COPD (2) , only approximately 20% of smokers develop COPD. Previous studies have shown that there are heritable risk factors (3, 4) , but the relationship between genetic risk and the molecular changes associated with COPD remains unknown. Although the traditional definition of COPD is based on spirometry measurements, recent work suggests that distinct COPD subtypes are independent of spirometry, such as those with emphysema predominance (5) , chronic bronchitis (6) , or frequent exacerbations (7) . The molecular mechanisms for these phenotypes remain largely unknown, but several studies using small panels of selected biomarkers suggest that inflammation plays a role in distinguishing phenotypes (8, 9) .\r\n Although the primary site of disease in COPD is the lung, increasing evidence indicates that COPD is a systemic disease with such manifestations as inflammation, weight loss, and skeletal muscle dysfunction (10, 11) . Several systemic biomarkers (e.g., serum amyloid A and procalcitonin) have been associated with exacerbations of COPD (12) . Furthermore, biomarkers in plasma, sputum, and exhaled breath are also associated with fat-free mass in subjects with mild COPD (13) . Because of its systemic nature, we hypothesized that genome-wide expression profiling of peripheral blood may be used to identify signatures of COPD phenotypes.\r\n Genome-wide expression studies in subjects with COPD and emphysema have been performed in lung tissue, but typically have involved small sample sizes (n \u00bc 16-75) because of the invasiveness of sample collection (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . As an alternative, we propose the use of peripheral blood to study gene expression profiles in smokers with and without COPD because of its noninvasive availability and ease of use for biomarker screening. The utility of peripheral blood gene expression profiling for the identification of molecular signatures has been demonstrated in a wide range of diseases and disorders, including cancers and neurologic disease (19) . Furthermore, studies of COPD have found overlapping gene expression signatures between blood and lung tissue (20) or alveolar macrophages (21) . However, those recent COPD studies of blood involved small sample sizes (n \u00bc 24-38) (20, 21) and therefore low statistical power to observe real differences, or they primarily examined subjects with less severe COPD (22) . To overcome these limitations, we describe an investigation, which to our knowledge is the largest to use gene expression profiling (n \u00bc 211) in blood, with a comprehensive representation of COPD severity.\r\n This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at National Jewish Health. All subject participants provided written, informed consent and were part of the COPDGene cohort of current and former smokers aged 45-80 years, with a history of smoking at least 10 pack-years, and who self-identified as either non-Hispanic white or African-American, and who had not experienced an acute exacerbation of COPD for at least 30 days (23) . Subjects were initially divided into either a hypothesis (n \u00bc 136) or a replication\/testing (n \u00bc 75) group. The hypothesis group was designed to represent a COPD cohort with a broad range of airflow obstruction, and was balanced with respect to demographic and clinical covariates (Table 1) . To validate our top findings using an independent platform (as will be discussed), 74 subjects in the hypothesis group were randomly selected as a confirmation group, in addition to the 75 independent replication subjects (see Figure E1 and Table E1 in the online supplement).\r\n COPD is defined as post-bronchodilator airflow obstruction with a ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) to forced expiratory volume (FVC) of less than 0.70, and is further subdivided into Stages 1-4, based on Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines (24) . Subjects with FEV 1 \/FVC greater than or equal to 70 and FEV 1 percentage of less than 80% post-bronchodilator were considered GOLD unclassified (25) . Secondary endpoints included percent emphysema, gas trapping, and 6-minute walking distance (please see the online supplement for further details) (23) .\r\n Peripheral blood was drawn into a BD Vacutainer Cell Preparation Tube (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), which was processed within 60 minutes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Upon centrifugation, lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells appeared in a distinct band and were isolated from the supernatant. RNA isolation was performed using Qiagen RNeasy RNA isolation spin-column kits and protocol, combined with the fully automated Qiagen QIAcube (both from Qiagen, Valencia, CA).\r\n The expression of 54,675 transcripts was measured using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 Gene Array (GEO accession number GSE 42057; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Quality control was performed, and data were filtered and normalized (see the online supplement). For each probe set, a linear model was fit for the association between gene expression and lung function while controlling for age, sex, body mass index, parental history of COPD, and two smoking variables (smoking status and pack-years). Afterward, the statistical significance of the slope for expression was tested and controlled at a 0.05 false-discovery rate (FDR) (26) .\r\n Genes whose expression levels were associated with lung function were further investigated using IPA (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). The overrepresentation of significant genes within pathways was assessed using Fisher's exact test, and the FDR was controlled at 0.10.\r\n Based upon preliminary results, 46 genes of interest were selected for validation, using the Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Open Array Platform (see the online supplement). Expression was determined as fold change compared with a panel of five control genes. The Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated for primary clinical endpoints, and P values were controlled at an FDR of 0.05. Combined P value calculations between platforms were performed using the Stouffer combined P value test in both directions (up-regulated or down-regulated) (27) .\r\n The demographics of subjects used for microarray analysis are listed by GOLD stage in Table 1 . Attempts were made to balance subjects by age, sex, and pack-years for different GOLD stages, and to include a spectrum of emphysema severity. Clinical phenotypes were associated with GOLD stage, pack-years of smoking, and current smoking status.\r\n After microarray data normalization and filtering (see the online supplement), separate linear models for the remaining 12,531 transcripts were fit for post-bronchodilator FEV 1 percentage and *For categorical covariates, a GOLD stage-specific percentage is given, along with a P value based on a x 2 test of association. Standard deviations are provided in parentheses.\r\n y For continuous covariates, a GOLD stage-specific mean is given, along with a P value based on an overall F-test for equality of means. FEV 1 \/FVC across the 136 subjects. The total number of transcripts whose relative abundance was associated with FEV 1 percentage, while controlling for demographic and smoking covariates, was 1,090. The total number of transcripts whose relative abundance was associated with FEV 1 \/FVC while controlling for covariates was 1,745. Their intersection involved 993 transcripts (Table E2) . For the most statistically significant genes, gene expression explained almost 20% of the variation in FEV 1 percentage ( Figure E2 ). With covariates, the entire clinical and gene expression model explained about 25% of the variation in FEV 1 percentage.\r\n A preliminary investigation revealed that 830 genes of the 993 statistically significant transcripts mapped to 266 canonical pathways (Table E3 ). Thirty of these had more statistically significant genes represented than would be expected by chance. A large fraction of those (15 out of 30) were related to immunity and inflammatory responses (e.g., Calcium-Induced T Lymphocyte Apoptosis, T Cell Receptor Signaling, Role of Macrophages, Fibroblasts and Endothelial Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis). An example in Figure 1 shows the role of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in the regulation of the immune response pathway, where the transcription factor NFAT is upregulated in subjects with more severe COPD. Metabolic pathways were also overrepresented in our list (e.g., sphingolipid metabolism) (28) .\r\n A quantitative RT-PCR strategy was used for the confirmation and replication of PBMC gene expression in 46 selected genes (Table E4) . Candidate genes were selected from preliminary microarray results, based on their overall significance according Figure 1 .

Confirmation involved 74 random subjects profiled in the microarray study ( Figure E1 ). Another 75 independent subjects were not used in the microarray experiments, but were used for the \"replication\" (or testing) cohort (Table E1) .\r\n Twenty-six of the 46 genes profiled showed significant correlation between expression and FEV 1 \/FVC over the complete cohort (FDR-adjusted P , 0.05; see Table E4 in the online data supplement; significant results for FEV 1 percentage involve a subset of results for FEV 1 \/FVC, and therefore FEV 1 \/FVC is reported). The magnitude of adjusted P values and the direction of effects (correlation) were similar between the confirmation and replication cohorts. For the 46 genes, the effects of smoking on expression were examined in the larger microarray study, and current smoking status was not predictive of gene expression for any individual probe set on the microarray. However, pack-years were significant for one probe set in the PLCL2 gene (Table E5) .\r\n For the final selection of genes, we examined the most significant discovered, based on results from both platforms, namely, the microarray (n \u00bc 136) and quantitative RT-PCR (n \u00bc 75, i.e., the replication cohort not contained in the original microarray study). Table 2 lists the top 16 candidates for both panels (FDR , 0.05).\r\n Many of the 16 candidate genes associated with airflow obstruction were also associated with secondary clinical phenotypes (FDR , 0.05). Twelve were correlated with emphysema, 13 were correlated with gas trapping, and eight were correlated with distance walked (Table E6 ). None of these candidate genes were associated with chronic bronchitis. Correlations were consistent with the microarray results (Table E7 ) and were based on disease severity, namely, if there was a positive correlation with emphysema and gas trapping, there was a negative correlation with distance walked, FEV 1 percentage, and FEV 1 \/FVC, and vice versa. Eight genes produced significant correlations for primary and secondary phenotypes (Figure 2 ).\r\n To assess the predictive power of the top candidate genes to predict disease status, the supervised learning algorithm \"random forests\" was used to construct a classifier from the top candidate genes in Table 2 . The estimated error rate was approximately 14%, based on the expression of probe sets for these genes, using the microarray data on the original subjects. A similar analysis was performed on the quantitative RT-PCR data using the replication subjects (those not in the microarray analysis), and the estimated error rate was 10%.\r\n Although no other studies this large have investigated PBMC gene expression in COPD, a recent study reported on wholeblood microarray gene expression experiments, using the Sentrix Human WG-6 BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) microarray platform in 67 test subjects with 69 confirmation subjects (GOLD Stages 1 and 2) (22) . A meta-analysis with our results identified a significant overlap of 61 genes (P \u00bc 3.1 3 10 210 ; see the online supplement).\r\n To explore the specificity of our findings in COPD, we examined three other PBMC expression studies in chronic inflammatory diseases unrelated to the lung (Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis) or acute inflammatory disease in the lung (severe acute respiratory syndrome). As with our study, probe sets were filtered if they were not present, and similarity was evident in the number of probe sets filtered in our results compared with each of the three studies (P , 10 23 ). Comparing retained probe sets, no significant overlap was found with our gene list and the differentially expressed genes between disease and control subjects in any of the three studies (P . 0.20). This indicates that the identified PBMC expression profiles have some specificity to COPD, and are not solely attributable to a general disease state.\r\n Metabolomics was also used to identify differences in smallmolecule profiles among these patients (see the online supplement). Metabolomic investigations identified 19 differentially expressed metabolites between control subjects and those with COPD. A search of the Metlin database resulted in six matches within an acceptable mass tolerance (,5 ppm). One of these, lactosylceramide, also known as galabiosylceramide, was confirmed using high-performance liquid chromatography time of flight ( Figure E3 ). Lactosylceramide was present in all patients with emphysema, a few of the smoking control subjects, and none of the patients with COPD but no emphysema (P \u00bc 1.93 3 10 211 ).\r\n To our knowledge, this is one of the largest studies of microarray gene expression profiling for COPD in humans. Unlike most PBMC microarray publications, we were able to confirm many of our most significant findings, using a large independent cohort of subjects. A few of these candidate genes were reported to be associated in smaller previously published studies of PBMC gene expression in similar cohorts, lending weight to the importance of the expression of these genes as biomarkers for COPD. In addition to the large size of both the discovery and testing cohorts, our study contained additional unique features, including a highly phenotyped study population with quantitative computed tomography scans, a balanced study design among GOLD groups, and companion metabolomic investigations.\r\n Most previous studies of gene expression in subjects with COPD have used either lung tissue (15, 17) or bronchial epithelia (16) . Because previous studies suggested that COPD is a systemic disease (11, 12, 29, 30) , we postulated that the presence of a systemic gene expression profile in subjects with COPD. The choice of studying gene expression in PBMCs versus lungspecific cells such as airway epithelium was primarily determined by the accessibility of suitable samples and the appropriateness of blood draw versus bronchoscopy as a clinical assay. Microarrays of PBMCs have been used to identify gene signatures from diseases as diverse as exertional heat injury (31) , sepsis (32) , and multiple sclerosis (33) . PBMCs have been used to discriminate between subjects with healthy lungs and those with lung diseases Figure 2 . Box plots of expression fold-change are based on quantitative RT-PCR in the complete cohort across Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease status. For all but TNSF13B, the box plots have been separated into panels, where outliers are displayed at the top. The line segment below each box in the plot is the first quartile, the box segment above this line is the second quartile, the horizontal line within each box represents the median, the box segment above the median is the third quartile, and the line segment above the box is the fourth quartile. Points outside the dashed lines are outliers (.1 box distance from third quartile).\r\n such as chronic beryllium disease (34) , lung cancer (35) , and pulmonary hypertension (36) , as well as to distinguish disease activity among patients with severe asthma (37) , lung cancer (38) , and sickle-cell disease (38) . For COPD, the PBMC microarray approach was used previously in small discovery studies of PBMCs from 38 research subjects (21) and 24 subjects undergoing resection for lung tumors (20) , as well as whole-blood leukocytes (which contain predominantly neutrophils) in 67 training research subjects (22) . These cohorts were limited by small sample size as well as a lack of comprehensive phenotyping (e.g., no emphysema according to high-resolution computed tomography). However, these studies showed promise for using PBMC gene expression as a biomarker COPD. The major limitation of human gene expression studies of COPD, in common with most human studies, is the inability to determine whether differences in gene expression are causative or correlative. However, for one of our candidate genes (ASAH1), we were also able to use a metabolomic approach to identify a related metabolite (lactosylceramide) as a biomarker of COPD and emphysema.\r\n The major analytic strategy to interpret hundreds of statistically significant differences in gene expression involves pathway analysis. Our analysis suggested that subjects with COPD were more likely to exhibit differences in transcriptional control (eukaryotic initiation factors 1 and 4, mechanistic target of rapamycin, G-protein signaling mediated by Tubby, and NFAT; see example in Figure 1) , T-cell activation (CD28 signaling in T helper cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 signaling in cytotoxic T lymphocytes), oxidative stress signaling (NO and reactive oxygen species), and metabolic pathways (sphingolipid metabolism and sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling). The abundance of differentially expressed immune and inflammatory response genes was not unexpected, considering that PBMCs were profiled. Although the candidate pathways were informative, the number of genes in each pathway was prohibitive for replication with a quantitative RT-PCR strategy. Thus, our strategy for the replication study included the selection of 46 genes based on a variety of criteria, including the most highly significant and those represented in pathways of interest. Some of the highlights of the candidate genes that were significant in the validation study will be discussed.\r\n ASAH1 encodes the enzyme N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase (acid ceramidase), which catalyzes the degradation of ceramide into sphingosine and fatty acid. ASAH1 has been associated with the lysosomal storage disorder Farber disease (39) . ASAH1 is highly expressed in the thyroid, lymphocytes, and lung (according to the Gene Atlas) (40) . The knockdown of rat alveolar macrophage ASAH1 improves the cigarette smokeinduced inhibition of apoptosis (41) . In a recent whole-blood microarray study using 67 training and 65 test subjects, ASAH1 whole-blood expression was the top candidate biomarker for distinguishing subjects with and without airflow obstruction (FEV 1 \/FVC , 0.7 versus FEV 1 \/FVC > 0.7, respectively) (22) . In our study, ASAH1 expression in PBMCs was higher in subjects with severe COPD and emphysema in both the training and test cohorts. As further evidence of this pathway's importance in emphysema and COPD, our metabolomic investigations identified a glycoceramide (galabiosylceramide) as a biomarker of emphysema. Interestingly, an abnormal accumulation of galabiosylceramide occurs in Fabry syndrome (angiokeratoma corporis diffusum), and patients with Fabry syndrome are prone to manifest COPD (42) and emphysema (43) . Ceramides are bioactive lipids that mediate cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration, and ceramidases such as acid ceramidase (ASAH1) catalyze the hydrolysis of ceramides into sphingosine (44) . Thus, acid ceramides play a role in metabolizing ceramides such as galabiosyceramide. We believe that this is the first report identifying galabiosylceramide as a biomarker of COPD. However, additional work will be needed to understand more about the role of the glycoceramides in the pathogenesis of emphysema.\r\n Forkhead box P1 (FOXP1) encodes a transcription factor that is expressed in the lung and is important during lung development (45) . FoxP1 protein has been shown to act cooperatively with histone deacetylase 2 to regulate the expression of IL-6, and it modulates the lung epithelial injury response (46) . In this study, we found that FOXP1 was also expressed in PBMCs, and that lower expression was associated with both airflow obstruction and emphysema. Low levels of FOXP1 expression were also reported to be associated with COPD in PBMCs from subjects undergoing resection for lung cancer (20) . FoxP1 has been shown to play a role in the integrin-dependent modulation of gene expression and macrophage differentiation (47) , and thus whether FOXP1 gene expression functions through lymphocytes or is a marker for gene expression in the lung remains unclear.\r\n Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) recognizes single-stranded viral RNA, and has been associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis (48) . We found that PBMCs expressed significantly lower concentrations of TLR8 in subjects with COPD. The lower expression of TLR8 in patients with COPD could result in increased susceptibility to viral infections (49) .\r\n Vanin 2 (VNN2) codes for a pantetheine hydrolase that is expressed in most tissues but demonstrates high expression in leukocytes (50) . We observed that subjects with COPD demonstrated lower VNN2 expression in PBMCs. An association between VNN2 expression in whole blood and COPD was also found in the cohort described by Edmiston and colleagues (22) . The mechanism by which Vanin 2 might cause COPD is unknown. However, Vanin 2 (formerly called GPI-80) has been shown to play a role in leukocyte trafficking, and is expressed in alveolar macrophages (51) .\r\n The major limitation of this study is its cross-sectional basis. This limitation may be assumed to be of minor importance, because the biologic variability of microarray gene expression is very low over short time periods (1 wk), suggesting the stability of the gene expression phenotype (52) . However, the stability of PBMC gene expression over longer time periods is unknown, and we do not know whether these gene expression profiles are predictive of declines in lung function or the progression of emphysema. Furthermore, in the parent COPDGene study (23) , smokers with normal spirometry were defined as control subjects. Based on these control subjects, we are not able to assess the effects of smoking alone in PBMC expression. Others reported that gene expression is associated with smoking in the oxidative stress response, antiapoptosis and cell-death signaling, and carcinogen metabolism (53) (54) (55) . However, we found that in our final candidate genes, the correlation of smoking variables with expression was either nonexistent or relatively small compared with the effects of other covariates. Several studies profiled lung tissue in COPD and emphysema subjects. We did not find a significant overlap in the PBMC genes identified in the present work and in those previous studies (data not shown). These results do not suggest a common signature between PBMCs and lung tissue, but the comparisons are also based on small sample sizes (n < 30), which compromises their statistical power. Future work in larger studies or in paired analyses with blood and lung tissue from the same subjects will be able to provide more definitive conclusions. Finally, because of cost and statistical power, the expression profiling was restricted to one racial and ethnic group (non-Hispanic whites). Although this is was a large study with an independent replication cohort, additional gene expression studies in never-smokers and in other ethnicities and races, and different clinical or research studies, would improve the generalizability of our findings. Despite these limitations, by using COPDGene, we were able to leverage a large, well-phenotyped cohort of subjects with COPD. The candidate genes identified in this study suggest new disease targets and further mechanistic studies that can be designed to identify which candidate genes might be important causes of COPD.\r\n In conclusion, this study is, to our knowledge, the largest gene expression study of smokers with COPD, and demonstrates the potential for PBMC gene expression to serve as a biomarker of COPD. The expression of candidate genes was confirmed in two independent groups with two different assays, and several candidates suggest novel potential targets pathways such as sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling, which were further verified by a plasma metabolomic approach.\r\n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.","sha":"395bb208b08adcb4d1a5610242ccc07b2e0e265b","publish_time":"2013-08-01","authors":"Bahr, Timothy M.; Hughes, Grant J.; Armstrong, Michael; Reisdorph, Rick; Coldren, Christopher D.; Edwards, Michael G.; Schnell, Christina; Kedl, Ross; LaFlamme, Daniel J.; Reisdorph, Nichole; Kechris, Katerina J.; Bowler, Russell P.","journal":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","doi":"10.1165\/rcmb.2012-0230oc","Title":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","H index":147.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) results from a combination of environmental exposures and genetic susceptibility, and is the third leading cause of death in the United States (1) .

However, the molecular interactions between virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells and inflammatory cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), have not been thoroughly characterized. Rat coronavirus (RCoV) is used as a model to study the immune response to viral infection in the lung of the natural host. We have developed an in vitro model to characterize the response of PMNs to RCoV-infected type I-like alveolar epithelial (AT1) cells, the primary target for RCoV infection in the alveoli. Multiple CXC chemokines that signal through CXCR2 were required for PMN chemotaxis toward medium from RCoV-infected AT1-like cells (RCoV-AT1). Furthermore, RCoV-AT1 inhibited spontaneous PMN apoptosis, including activation of effector caspase 3 and initiator caspases 8 and 9. Use of a selective inhibitor of CXCR2, SB265610, demonstrated that CXCR2 signaling was required for RCoV-AT1-mediated inhibition of PMN apoptosis. These data suggest that CXC chemokines produced by RCoV-infected AT1-like cells inhibit PMN apoptosis during infection.

Using a rodent model of respiratory viral infection, this research identifies the underlying mechanisms whereby virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells direct neutrophil functions. When combined with in vivo studies, this knowledge contributes to the understanding of viral pathogenesis in the lung.","text_body":"Numerous viruses infect the epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract, and increased pathogenesis is associated with the spread of viral infection to the alveoli. Viral antigens or nucleic acids have been found in type I (AT1) and\/or type II (AT2) alveolar epithelial cells in autopsy material from fatal infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and avian (H5N1) and 2009 pandemic (H1N1) influenza A viruses (1) (2) (3) (4) . These findings have been replicated in animal models that show a correlation between alveolar infection and disease severity (5, 6) . Damage to the alveolar surface and respiratory distress during viral infections are often associated with the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the alveoli, yet these responses are necessary to mount effective antiviral immune responses that eliminate the infection. PMNs are recruited to the respiratory tract early during viral infections and can contribute to effective immune responses but also can enhance pathology (7, 8) . Despite their importance in viral pathogenesis, little is known about the interactions between alveolar epithelial cells and the PMNs that contribute to inflammatory responses to viral infection.\r\n In addition to providing a barrier between inhaled air and the host, the epithelium of the respiratory tract actively participates in host defense. For example, Stat1 is required by airway epithelial cells, but not hematopoietic cells, to control Sendai virus infection in mice (9) . Although several studies have characterized proinflammatory responses to viral infection of epithelial cells from the conducting airways or immortalized cell lines, fewer studies have focused on the physiologically relevant cells of the alveoli (10) . AT2 cells can be isolated from human or rodent lungs and cultured to maintain a highly differentiated AT2 cell phenotype or transdifferentiate into an AT1like cell phenotype (11, 12) . Due to the difficulty of isolating primary AT1 cells, in vitro transdifferentiated AT1-like cells are commonly used to study AT1 cell functions in vitro. The AT1like phenotype is characterized by a loss of AT2 and a gain of AT1 cell markers (12) . Highly differentiated cultures of human AT2 and AT1-like cells express proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines upon infection with influenza A virus (13, 14) . Furthermore, the expression of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines by alveolar epithelial cells correlates with the relative virulence of influenza virus strains (14) . Because the alveolar epithelium is an important target for viral infection and expresses proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to infection, we propose that these cells are critical for the initiation and regulation of immune responses in the lung.\r\n Rat coronavirus (RCoV) infects and causes acute inflammatory disease in the respiratory tract of rats, providing a model to study respiratory viral pathogenesis in the natural host of the virus (15) . Adult rats infected intratracheally with RCoV have increased levels of CXC chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which is correlated with the recruitment of PMNs to the airways (15) . Viral antigen is predominantly found in AT1 cells within the alveoli of RCoV-infected rats (15) . RCoV induces expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by rat AT1-like cells in vitro (16) , suggesting that AT1 cells may play a critical role in the inflammatory response to RCoV infection. To study the interactions between the alveolar epithelium and PMNs during coronaviral infection, supernatant medium from RCoV-infected AT1-like cells was tested for the ability to promote chemotaxis and alter PMN apoptosis. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms that mediate these functions were defined. Further studies are needed to determine the in vivo relevance of these interactions to viral pathogenesis in the lung.\r\n Animal protocols were approved by the University of Idaho Animal Care and Use Committee according to the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. AT2 cells were isolated from 6-to 10-week-old Simonsen Albino rats (Simonsen Laboratories, Gilroy, CA) and transdifferentiated to an AT1-like phenotype (16) . RCoV strain sialodacryoadenitis virus, obtained from Dr. Kathryn Holmes (University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO), was purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and stored in TMS buffer as described (16) . AT1-like cells were inoculated with RCoV or TMS (mock) diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium. After infection, cells were supplemented with RPMI\/10% FBS\/2% PSF (RPMI). Viral infection was confirmed by immunofluorescent detection of viral nucleocapsid antigen (16) , and supernatant medium was harvested 24 hours after viral inoculation for chemotaxis and apoptosis assays.\r\n Rats were killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital, and blood was collected into heparin (500 U). Erythrocytes were removed by dextran sedimentation, and granulocytes were separated by centrifugation over Histopaque 1083. Residual erythrocytes were lysed, and granulocytes were resuspended in endotoxin-free HBSS\/1% BSA and kept on ice. To isolate PMNs from bone marrow, femurs and tibias were flushed with HBSS\/1% BSA, and erythrocytes were lysed before granulocyte separation using Ficoll. All preparations consisted of approximately 95% PMNs, with less than 5% eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, based on differential cell staining.\r\n Supernatant media from RCoV-infected (RCoV-AT1), mock-inoculated (mock-AT1), and uninfected (RPMI-AT1) AT1-like cells were tested in chemotaxis assays using ChemoTx chambers with a 3-mm pore filter (NeuroProbe, Gaithersburg, MD) (17) . Migration of 3 3 10 4 calcein-AMlabeled PMNs to the lower chamber was quantified using a FLUO-Optima fluorescence plate reader (BMG LabTech, San Francisco, CA), in comparison to a standard curve (see Figure E1 in the online supplement). Where indicated, PMNs were treated with SB265610 (100 nM) or vehicle (DMSO), or neutralizing antibodies against CXC chemokines were added to the medium in the lower chamber before chemotaxis assay.\r\n PMN apoptosis was induced by cycloheximide (Cx) (100 ng\/ml), hrTNF-a (0.1 mg\/ml), or exposure to 15,000 mJ UV irradiation for 15 minutes in a StrataLinker UV Crosslinker (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA). SB265610 (100 nM) was added to PMNs where indicated. Cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry using FACSAria and FACSDiva 6.0 software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The activity of caspases 2, 3, 8, or 9 was quantified using luminescent substrate assays (Caspase-Glo; Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Caspase 2 activity was measured in the presence of Ac-DEVD-CHO (1 mM) and MG132 (60 mM). Luminescence was measured using a FLUOstar Optima, and data analysis was performed using MARS software (BMG Labtech Inc.).\r\n Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 5.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). P values were obtained using one-way ANOVA and Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test.\r\n Rat PMNs Actively Migrate toward Medium from RCoV-Infected, but not Mock-Inoculated, AT1-Like Cells Viral antigen is predominantly found in AT1 cells in the alveoli of RCoV-infected rats, and PMNs are present at high levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid early during infection (15) . We propose that RCoV-infected AT1 cells recruit PMNs to the lung during infection. An in vitro chemotaxis assay was used to test whether rat bone marrow-derived PMNs actively migrate toward supernatant medium harvested from AT1-like cells 24 hours after infection by RCoV. Fluorescently labeled PMNs were placed in the upper chamber of a chemotaxis plate, and medium to be analyzed for chemoattractant ability was placed in the lower chamber. Fluorescence intensity was measured in the lower chamber to quantify PMN migration through the 0.3-mm filter separating the two chambers. A standard curve was generated to estimate cell number based on fluorescence intensity ( Figure E1 ). Chemotaxis of PMNs toward the bacterial tripeptide FMLP was considered to represent 100% chemotaxis. PMNs had approximately 20% chemotaxis toward RPMI medium alone. PMNs underwent significant chemotaxis toward medium from RCoVinfected AT1-like cells (RCoV-AT1) but not to medium from mock-inoculated (mock-AT1) or noninfected (RPMI-AT1) cells ( Figure 1A ). The medium from RCoV-infected cells contains viral particles; therefore, we quantified PMN chemotaxis toward purified virus. In comparison to chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1, purified RCoV or viral storage buffer (TMS) did not induce PMN chemotaxis ( Figure 1B ). Finally, RCoV-AT1 was UV irradiated, which inactivates viral infectivity, before incubation with PMNs. UV irradiation of RCoV-AT1 did not reduce PMN chemotaxis ( Figure 1B ). Taken together, these data indicate that PMNs actively migrate toward a soluble factor secreted by RCoV-infected AT1-like cells and not to virus particles.\r\n To further investigate the mechanism whereby RCoV-AT1 medium induces PMN chemotaxis, we evaluated the role of CXCR2, which is the common receptor for rat CXC chemokines (18) . Rat PMNs were incubated with an antagonist of CXCR2, SB265610, before exposure to RCoV-AT1 in the chemotaxis assay (19) . PMNs treated with SB265610 had significantly reduced chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1 ( Figure 2 ). However, SB265610 did not reduce chemotaxis of PMN to the same level as toward RPMI alone. Preincubation of PMNs with vehicle alone (DMSO) did not alter migration toward RCoV-AT1. Thus, inhibition of CXCR2 signaling significantly decreased PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1, although not completely to background levels.\r\n Because multiple rat CXC chemokines are known ligands of CXCR2, we tested their individual roles in PMN chemotaxis to RCoV-AT1 medium. Chemotaxis was not affected by the addition of neutralizing antibody to any one of the CXC chemokines alone ( Figure 3A ). However, when all four ELR1 CXC chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL5) were neutralized, PMN chemotaxis decreased by more than 60% ( Figure 3B ). Similar to the CXCR2 inhibitor, neutralization of the four CXC chemokines did not completely block PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1. If a combination of three antibodies included anti-CXCL1 and anti-CXCL3, PMN chemotaxis was inhibited to a similar level as with all four antibodies. The use of neutralizing antibodies to CXCL1 and CXCL3 together inhibited PMN chemotaxis by approximately 40%, which was statistically significant but not as effective as neutralization of all four CXC chemokines. Isotype control antibodies did not affect PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1 ( Figure 3A ). The specificity of each neutralizing antibody was tested against recombinant CXC chemokines ( Figure E2 ). These experiments confirmed that each antibody neutralized the chemoattractant activity of its specific CXC protein. The antibodies also had various levels of cross-reactivity to the other CXC chemokines. Anti-CXCL1 completely blocked chemotaxis toward rCXCL1 and partially inhibited chemotaxis toward rCXCL3. Anti-CXCL3 neutralized the function of rCXCL2 and rCXCL3 but did not significantly reduce chemotaxis toward rCXCL1. Anti-CXCL5 only inhibited PMN chemotaxis toward rCXCL5; however, chemotaxis of PMNs to rCXCL5 was much lower than toward the other recombinant proteins. To determine whether the concentrations of individual CXC chemokines in RCoV-AT1 correlated with the results from the neutralization experiments, CXC chemokines were quantified in RCoV-AT1 medium at 24, 48, and 72 hours after infection ( Figure 3C ). All of the CXC chemokines tested were induced by RCoV in AT1-like cells by 24 hours, which was the time point used for the chemotaxis experiments. CXCL1 and CXCL3 were the most abundant CXC chemokines in RCoV-AT1 medium through the time course of RCoV infection. The concentration of CXCL5 was similar to CXCL1 at 24 hours but did not increase comparably over time. CXCL2 was secreted at relatively low concentrations at all time points. These data suggest that multiple CXC chemokines signaling through CXCR2 contribute to PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1. CXCL1 and CXCL3 seem to be the most critical for PMN chemotaxis and, along with CXCL5, are the most abundant CXC chemokines in RCoV-AT1 medium used for the chemotaxis experiments.\r\n PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1 was significantly, but not completely, inhibited by CXCR2 inhibitor (Figure 2 ) or neutralizing antibodies to all four CXC chemokines ( Figure 3B ). We previously showed that AT1 cells secrete multiple cytokines and chemokines upon infection with RCoV (16) . It is possible that other factors, in addition to CXC chemokines, contribute to PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1. In addition, CXC chemokines form biologically active homodimers and heterodimers (20) (21) (22) . It is not known whether neutralizing antibodies effectively inhibit chemotaxis toward CXC chemokines when present in mixed solutions of monomers, homodimers, and heterodimers. To further examine the molecular basis of PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1, recombinant CXC chemokines were combined at concentrations equivalent to those in RCoV-AT1 and analyzed in a PMN chemotaxis assay. PMN chemotaxis toward the mixture of recombinant CXC chemokines was approximately 20% lower than toward RCoV-AT1 ( Figure 3D ), which contains comparable concentrations of CXC chemokines. In contrast to the results with RCoV-AT1, PMN chemotaxis toward the recombinant CXC chemokines in combination was completely inhibited by the four neutralizing antibodies ( Figure 3D ). These data indicate that, under our assay conditions, interactions between multiple CXC chemokines do not interfere with neutralization of their PMN chemoattractant functions by these antibodies. Therefore, the incomplete neutralization of PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1 using anti-CXC antibodies is likely due to additional factors in RCoV-AT1 that promote PMN chemotaxis.\r\n PMNs contribute to tissue damage during respiratory viral infections due to the release of cytotoxic mediators. Rapid spontaneous apoptosis of PMNs limits damage and is critical for resolution of neutrophilic inflammation. To identify interactions between the virus-infected alveolar epithelium and PMNs that may affect PMN apoptosis, we analyzed the impact of RCoV-AT1 medium on spontaneous PMN apoptosis in vitro. PMNs isolated from rat blood were incubated in RCoV-AT1 or mock-AT1 medium, and apoptosis was analyzed over time. As expected, the proportion of PMNs that bound annexin V increased during incubation in RPMI-AT1 (from 25.6 6 5.2% at 0 h to 79.5 6 4.6% at 48 h) ( Figure 4A ). This rate of apoptosis is similar to the spontaneous apoptosis of human PMNs incubated in vitro reported by others (23, 24) . Incubation of PMNs in RCoV-AT1 resulted in a significant inhibition of apoptosis compared with PMNs incubated in mock-AT1 or RPMI-AT1 at the 24-and 48-hour time points. There was no significant difference in annexin V binding to PMNs incubated in mock-AT1 or RPMI-AT1 compared with RPMI alone (data not shown).\r\n Effector caspase 3 is activated during spontaneous apoptosis of human PMNs, and inhibition of caspase 3 reduces PMN apoptosis (24, 25) . Therefore, we analyzed the activity of caspase 3 in PMNs incubated in RPMI or RCoV-AT1 using the Caspase-Glo 3\/7 Assay (Promega Corp.), which does not distinguish between caspases 3 and 7. As expected, caspase 3\/7 was activated in PMNs incubated in RPMI. Incubation of PMNs in RCoV-AT1 significantly inhibited activation of caspase 3\/7 at 6 hours compared with incubation in RPMI ( Figure 4B ). Caspase 3 can be activated by initiator caspase 8, which is activated by death receptor adapter proteins, or caspase 9, which is activated by the apoptosome after mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Both caspase 8 and 9 are activated during spontaneous apoptosis of PMNs (25) . As expected, caspases 8 and 9 had significantly increased activity in PMNs by 4 hours after isolation (data not shown). Incubation of PMNs in RCoV-AT1 inhibited the enzymatic activity of caspases 8 and 9 at 4 hours ( Figure 4B ). This suggests that RCoV-AT1 inhibits an early step in caspase 8-and caspase 9-dependent pathways of PMN apoptosis.\r\n Although the role of caspase 2 in the spontaneous apoptosis program of PMNs has not been defined, caspase 2 induces apoptotic signaling upstream of the mitochondrium (26). Caspase 2 is also activated by death domain-containing receptors, but, unlike caspase 8, caspase 2 activation is independent of Fas-Associated protein with Death Domain (27) . Caspase 2 activity during spontaneous apoptosis of PMN was quantified and compared with PMN incubated in RCoV-AT1. Caspase 2 activity in PMNs increased significantly during 4 hours of culture in vitro ( Figure 4C ). However, caspase 2 activation was not affected by incubation of PMNs in RCoV-AT1, suggesting that inhibition of caspase 2 activation is not required for RCoV-AT1-mediated inhibition of PMN apoptosis. In summary, medium from RCoV-infected, but not mockinoculated, AT1-like cells inhibited spontaneous apoptosis of PMNs in vitro, including activation of caspases 3\/7, 8, and 9 but not caspase 2.\r\n Soluble Factors Secreted by RCoV-Infected AT1-Like Cells, but Not Viral Particles, Inhibit PMN Apoptosis RSV directly inhibits PMN apoptosis, which is dependent upon endosomal uptake of the virus (28) . Therefore, we determined whether viral particles in RCoV-AT1 medium directly inhibit spontaneous apoptosis of rat PMNs. PMNs were incubated in RPMI containing sucrose gradient-purified RCoV at a concentration approximately equal to that in RCoV-AT1 or viral storage buffer (TMS), and apoptosis was analyzed by annexin V binding and flow cytometry. Spontaneous apoptosis was not altered by incubation of PMNs with purified virus or TMS compared with incubation in RPMI alone ( Figure 5A ). To confirm that infectious virus particles are not required to inhibit PMN apoptosis, RCoV-AT1 was UV irradiated before incubation with PMNs. UV irradiation has been shown to completely inactivate RCoV (16) . However, irradiation of RCoV-AT1 did not affect its ability to inhibit spontaneous apoptosis of PMNs ( Figure 5A ). These data together suggest that a soluble factor(s) secreted by RCoV-infected AT1-like cells, rather than infectious virus particles alone, inhibits PMN apoptosis.\r\n CXC chemokines, including human IL-8 and GRO-a and rat CXCL1, inhibit PMN apoptosis (19, 23, 29, 30) . Rat CXC chemokines are ligands for CXCR2 (18) . Therefore, we inhibited CXCR2 signaling with SB265610 to analyze whether CXCR2 signaling was required for RCoV-AT1-mediated suppression of PMN apoptosis. Rat PMNs were incubated in RPMI or RCoV-AT1 with or without SB265610, and apoptosis was analyzed by annexin V binding and caspase 3 activity. SB265610 did not alter spontaneous apoptosis of PMNs, as shown by incubation in RPMI (Figures 5B and 5C) . However, the inhibition of apoptosis by RCoV-AT1 was reversed to the level of spontaneous apoptosis by the addition of SB265610. The addition of DMSO did not alter PMN apoptosis (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that RCoV-AT1 inhibits PMN apoptosis by signaling through CXCR2, suggesting that one or more CXC chemokines expressed by RCoV-infected AT1-like cells inhibit PMN apoptosis.\r\n RCoV-AT1 inhibited activation of caspases 8 and 9 ( Figure 4B ), which initiate apoptosis triggered by extrinsic and intrinsic signals, respectively. To determine whether RCoV-AT1 could inhibit apoptosis induced by extrinsic and intrinsic signals, PMNs were incubated in RCoV-AT1 or RPMI in the presence of TNF-a or Cx for 6 hours, or PMNs were UV irradiated and then incubated for 6 hours with RCoV-AT1 or RPMI. TNF-a, Cx, and UV irradiation all induced PMN apoptosis as compared with PMN incubated in RPMI ( Figure 6A ). RCoV-AT1 had no significant effect on UV-or Cx-induced apoptosis. In contrast, incubation in RCoV-AT1 dramatically decreased TNF-a-induced PMN apoptosis, as demonstrated by annexin V binding and caspase 3 activation (Figures 6A  and 6B ). Mock-AT1 had no effect on PMN apoptosis induced by TNF-a, Cx, or UV light (data not shown). In summary, medium from RCoV-infected AT1-like cells inhibited spontaneous and TNF-a-induced PMN apoptosis, suggesting inhibition of a pathway shared by both apoptotic programs.\r\n The alveolar epithelium is an important target for viruses that infect the lung (1) (2) (3) (4) . Communication between virus-infected epithelial cells and PMNs initiates and regulates the subsequent response in the lung. The purpose of this study was to characterize the response of PMNs to virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells. RCoV is a respiratory pathogen of rats that predominantly infects AT1 cells in the alveoli and induces a robust influx of PMNs into the airways early during infection (15) . We used in vitro transdifferentiated cultures of rat AT1-like cells as a well described model for AT1 cell functions (12) . Medium from RCoV-AT1 was analyzed for the ability to induce chemotaxis and apoptosis of rat PMNs.\r\n PMNs underwent active chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1 but not mock-AT1 or purified virus, indicating that a soluble factor released by RCoV-infected AT1-like cells mediates chemotaxis. Furthermore, PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1 was reduced by a CXCR2 inhibitor and by neutralizing antibodies to multiple CXC chemokines. These experiments indicate that virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells can direct PMN chemotaxis through the production of CXC chemokines that signal through CXCR2 on PMNs. However, additional studies are needed to determine whether alveolar epithelial cells play a significant role in PMN recruitment in vivo. Although human PMNs express two functional receptors for ELR1 CXC chemokines (CXCR1 and CXCR2), rat PMNs only express functional CXCR2 (31) . Furthermore, PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1 was significantly inhibited by SB265610, a nonpeptide inhibitor of CXCR2 that specifically inhibits chemotaxis of rat PMNs toward CXCL1 and CXCL2 in vitro and blocks recruitment of PMNs to the lungs of hyperoxia-exposed rats (19) . CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL5 are ligands for rat CXCR2, yet they bind with different affinities and induce calcium mobilization at different levels (18, (31) (32) (33) . Therefore, it was important to determine whether CXC chemokines have redundant functions in PMN chemotaxis. We show that neutralizing antibodies to individual CXC chemokines had no effect on PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1, suggesting redundant chemoattractant functions. Moreover, CXCL1 and CXCL3 were present in the highest concentrations in RCoV-AT1 medium, and neutralization of both of these chemokines simultaneously was required to reduce PMN chemotaxis. However, when all four CXC chemokines were neutralized simultaneously, PMN chemotaxis was not completely blocked compared with medium alone ( Figure 3B ). The neutralizing antibodies effectively blocked PMN chemotaxis toward their respective CXC chemokines ( Figure E2 ). These results indicate that there may Figure 5 . The role of viral particles and CXCR2 signaling in RCoV-AT1mediated inhibition of spontaneous PMN apoptosis. PMNs were isolated from rat blood. (A) Apoptosis of PMNs incubated with UV-irradiated RCoV-AT1 or purified RCoV or virus storage buffer (TMS) for 24 hours was analyzed by annexin V-FITC binding and flow cytometry. Apoptosis of PMNs incubated with RCoV-AT1 with or without CXCR2 inhibitor (SB265610) was analyzed by (B) annexin V-FITC binding and (C) caspase 3 activity using a luminescent substrate assay.

Statistical significance as indicated (***P , 0.001).\r\n be additional factors present in RCoV-AT1 that are promoting PMN chemotaxis when the CXC chemokines are neutralized.\r\n Although the role of homo-and heterodimer formation in the biological activity of rat CXC chemokines has not been studied, multiple studies have evaluated the effect of dimerization on the activity of human CXCL8\/IL-8. Although CXCL8 in solution fluctuates between monomeric and dimeric forms, fixed monomers and dimers that are unable to associate or dissociate, respectively, have been used to evaluate their chemoattractant activities. CXCL8 monomers exhibit increased, and dimers have decreased, CXCR1-dependent chemotaxis in comparison to wild-type CXCL8 (21) . However, CXCR2-dependent chemotaxis does not differ in response to fixed monomeric or dimeric forms of CXCL8 (21) . Furthermore, monomeric and dimeric forms of CXCL8 have biological activity in vivo, although the various forms have distinct roles in PMN recruitment (22) . In addition to homodimers, CXCL8 forms heterodimers with a related CXC chemokine, PF4, which reduces the chemoattractant functions of CXCL8 (20) . We show that neutralizing antibodies completely inhibited PMN chemotaxis toward the four recombinant CXC chemokines when combined at concentrations equivalent to that in RCoV-AT1 medium ( Figure 3D ). Thus, heterotypic interactions between CXC chemokines did not affect neutralization of their chemoattractant functions. Furthermore, upon neutralization of the CXC chemokines, additional chemoattractant activity remained ( Figure 3B ). These experiments, combined with the finding that CXCR2 inhibitor did not completely inhibit PMN chemotaxis (Figure 2 ), support the hypothesis that other factors, in addition to the ELR1 CXC chemokines, contribute to PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1.\r\n Apoptosis of PMNs regulates their lifespan in circulation and promotes effective resolution of inflammatory responses. Inhibition of PMN apoptosis during infection can prolong their functional lifespan but can also delay resolution of inflammation. Because PMNs contain an arsenal of cytotoxic molecules, their death by apoptosis and rapid removal by phagocytic macrophages is critical for preventing untoward tissue damage. Apoptotic PMNs are phagocytosed by macrophages, thereby preventing the release of cytotoxic components, including reactive oxygen species and proteolytic enzymes that will damage the lung. In addition, phagocytosis of apoptotic PMNs has immunosuppressive effects on macrophages, which further down-regulates inflammatory responses. During inflammatory responses, the apoptotic program of PMNs can be delayed, thereby prolonging their functional lifespan but also contributing to pathology. Mimicking their short life span in vivo, PMNs undergo spontaneous apoptosis when incubated in vitro (23, 24) . We observed that incubation of PMNs in RCoV-AT1 significantly inhibited their spontaneous apoptosis, including inhibition of initiator caspases 8 and 9 and effector caspase 3. We further showed that purified virus or UV inactivation of virus in RCoV-AT1 had no effect on PMN apoptosis. This is in contrast to other viruses that directly alter the apoptosis program of PMNs. Infectious and heat-inactivated RSV directly inhibits PMN apoptosis through activation of PI3Kand NF-kB-dependent prosurvival pathways (28) . Furthermore, RSV induces expression of IL-6 by PMNs, which may provide autocrine regulation of PMN survival (28, 34, 35) . In contrast to RSV, influenza A virus enhances PMN apoptosis in vitro (36) . Our results demonstrate that purified RCoV, at a similar concentration as in RCoV-AT1 medium, does not directly affect spontaneous PMN apoptosis. Furthermore, we showed that incubation of PMNs in RCoV-AT1 with a CXCR2 inhibitor (SB265610) reversed apoptosis inhibition. This suggests that CXC chemokines that are induced by RCoV infection of AT1 cells are responsible for inhibiting PMN apoptosis. Multiple studies have demonstrated CXC chemokine-mediated inhibition of PMN apoptosis. Human PMNs have decreased spontaneous apoptosis in the presence of IL-8 and Gro-a (30, 37) . Although IL-8 can bind to CXCR1 or CXCR2, a selective inhibitor of CXCR2 completely reverses the inhibitory effect of IL-8 on PMN apoptosis (37) . Wang and colleagues showed that rat CXCL1 inhibits astrocyte apoptosis induced by ceramide through CXCR2 signaling (38) . Apoptosis of rat PMNs is inhibited by culture in CXCL1, and this effect is reversed by pretreatment with SB265610, confirming that CXCR2 signaling is required for apoptosis inhibition (19, 23, 29) .\r\n In addition to CXC chemokines, PMN apoptosis is also inhibited by cytokines, including GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-1b, IL-6, IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-15 (35, 39, 40) . In contrast, other proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-6, significantly induce PMN apoptosis (41) (42) (43) . Separate studies have reported that TNF-a and IL-6 induce or inhibit PMN apoptosis depending on the cytokine concentration or activation state of the PMNs (44, 45) . Additionally, Murray and colleagues demonstrated the importance of timing in TNF-a-induced PMN apoptosis (46) . When apoptosis was evaluated at time points before 8 hours, TNF-a promoted PMN apoptosis. In contrast, when incubated over 18 hours, TNF-a decreased PMN apoptosis. In our study, TNF-a-induced apoptosis was evaluated after 6 hours of incubation of PMNs isolated from rat blood, and we confirmed by staining of activation markers that the PMNs were not activated by our isolation procedure (data not shown). Inhibition of CXCR2 signaling by SB265610 completely restored caspase 3 activity in PMNs incubated in RCoV-AT1, suggesting that CXC chemokines in RCoV-AT1 are sufficient to inhibit caspase 3 activity in PMNs. However, the percentage of PMNs that bound annexin V was not completely restored when SB265610 was used. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that cytokines, in addition to CXC chemokines, present in RCoV-AT1 also contribute to the inhibition of PMN apoptosis.\r\n Spontaneous PMN apoptosis has been shown to be a caspasedependent apoptotic program because PMNs incubated with caspase inhibitors do not undergo apoptosis and can be triggered by extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways (47) . There are several studies that associate spontaneous PMN apoptosis with intrinsic mitochondrial signaling, including a decline in antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, translocation of proapoptotic Bax to the mitochondrium, and subsequent release of cytochrome c and caspase 9 activation (48, 49) . Other studies have described caspase 8-dependent spontaneous PMN apoptosis, involving ligand-independent clustering of death receptors (24) . Caspases 8 and 9 can then activate effector caspase 3, which is critical for spontaneous and TNF-a-induced apoptosis pathways in PMNs (24, 25, 50, 51) . Distinguishing between the intrinsic (caspase 9) and extrinsic (caspase 8) activation pathways is difficult because caspase 9 can also activate caspase 8, thereby intertwining these pathways. Thus, our observations that caspase 8 and 9 activities are inhibited by incubation of PMNs in RCoV-AT1 can suggest that the intrinsic pathway, whereby caspase 9 activation leads to caspase 8 activation, or both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are involved. Our finding that RCoV-AT1 inhibits TNF-a-induced PMN apoptosis, but not UV irradiation-or Cx-induced PMN apoptosis, further supports inhibition of the caspase 8-dependent extrinsic pathway (47) . Caspase 2, which can be activated by Fas-Associated protein with Death Domain-independent extrinsic pathways or intrinsic cellular stress pathways, was not inhibited by incubation of PMN in RCoV-AT1 medium. However, we evaluated caspase 2 activity through 4 hours of incubation. It is possible that RCoV-AT1 could inhibit caspase 2 activity at later time points. Although death domainmediated activation of caspase 2 occurs very early, activation through stress-response pathways might occur later in the PMN lifespan. The role of caspase 2 in PMN apoptosis has not been defined. Here, we show that caspase 2 activity increased upon incubation of rat PMNs in vitro. However, PMN apoptosis was inhibited by RCoV-AT1 medium despite activation of caspase 2. This suggests that caspase 2 activity is not sufficient to induce PMN apoptosis. This is in agreement with other studies that demonstrate that activation of caspase 2 in the absence of caspase 8 is not sufficient to mediate Fas-induced apoptosis in T cells (27) .\r\n Because alveolar epithelial cells are important targets for viral infection in the lung, a complete understanding of their contributions to inflammatory responses is needed. These studies defined the molecular mechanisms whereby virus-infected alveolar cells direct chemotaxis and inhibit spontaneous and induced PMN apoptosis. The relevance of these interactions during infection in vivo will further our understanding of viral pathogenesis in the lung. Rodent models of respiratory viral infections allow us to delineate molecular mechanisms in primary cells in vitro and correlate these findings with pathogenesis studies in the animal.\r\n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.","sha":"efb93ddcaa937de08324a3c0647bcabb919430ae","publish_time":"2012-06-01","authors":"Rzepka, Joanna P.; Haick, Anoria K.; Miura, Tanya A.","journal":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","doi":"10.1165\/rcmb.2011-0230oc","Title":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","H index":147.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Numerous viruses infect the epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract, and increased pathogenesis is associated with the spread of viral infection to the alveoli. Viral antigens or nucleic acids have been found in type I (AT1) and\/or type II (AT2) alveolar epithelial cells in autopsy material from fatal infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and avian (H5N1) and 2009 pandemic (H1N1) influenza A viruses (1) (2) (3) (4) . Due to the difficulty of isolating primary AT1 cells, in vitro transdifferentiated AT1-like cells are commonly used to study AT1 cell functions in vitro. Because the alveolar epithelium is an important target for viral infection and expresses proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to infection, we propose that these cells are critical for the initiation and regulation of immune responses in the lung. Further studies are needed to determine the in vivo relevance of these interactions to viral pathogenesis in the lung. Animal protocols were approved by the University of Idaho Animal Care and Use Committee according to the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. After infection, cells were supplemented with RPMI\/10% FBS\/2% PSF (RPMI). Rats were killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital, and blood was collected into heparin (500 U). Erythrocytes were removed by dextran sedimentation, and granulocytes were separated by centrifugation over Histopaque 1083. Supernatant media from RCoV-infected (RCoV-AT1), mock-inoculated (mock-AT1), and uninfected (RPMI-AT1) AT1-like cells were tested in chemotaxis assays using ChemoTx chambers with a 3-mm pore filter (NeuroProbe, Gaithersburg, MD) (17) . Migration of 3 3 10 4 calcein-AMlabeled PMNs to the lower chamber was quantified using a FLUO-Optima fluorescence plate reader (BMG LabTech, San Francisco, CA), in comparison to a standard curve (see Figure E1 in the online supplement). Where indicated, PMNs were treated with SB265610 (100 nM) or vehicle (DMSO), or neutralizing antibodies against CXC chemokines were added to the medium in the lower chamber before chemotaxis assay. PMN apoptosis was induced by cycloheximide (Cx) (100 ng\/ml), hrTNF-a (0.1 mg\/ml), or exposure to 15,000 mJ UV irradiation for 15 minutes in a StrataLinker UV Crosslinker (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA). Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 5.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). P values were obtained using one-way ANOVA and Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. PMNs had approximately 20% chemotaxis toward RPMI medium alone. UV irradiation of RCoV-AT1 did not reduce PMN chemotaxis ( Figure 1B ). Taken together, these data indicate that PMNs actively migrate toward a soluble factor secreted by RCoV-infected AT1-like cells and not to virus particles. Preincubation of PMNs with vehicle alone (DMSO) did not alter migration toward RCoV-AT1. The specificity of each neutralizing antibody was tested against recombinant CXC chemokines ( Figure E2 ). The antibodies also had various levels of cross-reactivity to the other CXC chemokines. Anti-CXCL1 completely blocked chemotaxis toward rCXCL1 and partially inhibited chemotaxis toward rCXCL3. The concentration of CXCL5 was similar to CXCL1 at 24 hours but did not increase comparably over time. CXCL2 was secreted at relatively low concentrations at all time points. It is possible that other factors, in addition to CXC chemokines, contribute to PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1. PMN chemotaxis toward the mixture of recombinant CXC chemokines was approximately 20% lower than toward RCoV-AT1 ( Figure 3D ), which contains comparable concentrations of CXC chemokines. PMNs contribute to tissue damage during respiratory viral infections due to the release of cytotoxic mediators. Rapid spontaneous apoptosis of PMNs limits damage and is critical for resolution of neutrophilic inflammation. To identify interactions between the virus-infected alveolar epithelium and PMNs that may affect PMN apoptosis, we analyzed the impact of RCoV-AT1 medium on spontaneous PMN apoptosis in vitro. Although the role of caspase 2 in the spontaneous apoptosis program of PMNs has not been defined, caspase 2 induces apoptotic signaling upstream of the mitochondrium (26). PMNs were incubated in RPMI containing sucrose gradient-purified RCoV at a concentration approximately equal to that in RCoV-AT1 or viral storage buffer (TMS), and apoptosis was analyzed by annexin V binding and flow cytometry. UV irradiation has been shown to completely inactivate RCoV (16) . CXC chemokines, including human IL-8 and GRO-a and rat CXCL1, inhibit PMN apoptosis (19, 23, 29, 30) . Rat CXC chemokines are ligands for CXCR2 (18) . SB265610 did not alter spontaneous apoptosis of PMNs, as shown by incubation in RPMI (Figures 5B and 5C) . RCoV-AT1 inhibited activation of caspases 8 and 9 ( Figure 4B ), which initiate apoptosis triggered by extrinsic and intrinsic signals, respectively. The alveolar epithelium is an important target for viruses that infect the lung (1) (2) (3) (4) . RCoV is a respiratory pathogen of rats that predominantly infects AT1 cells in the alveoli and induces a robust influx of PMNs into the airways early during infection (15) . These experiments indicate that virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells can direct PMN chemotaxis through the production of CXC chemokines that signal through CXCR2 on PMNs. However, additional studies are needed to determine whether alveolar epithelial cells play a significant role in PMN recruitment in vivo. We show that neutralizing antibodies to individual CXC chemokines had no effect on PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1, suggesting redundant chemoattractant functions. These results indicate that there may Figure 5 . The role of viral particles and CXCR2 signaling in RCoV-AT1mediated inhibition of spontaneous PMN apoptosis. Apoptosis of PMNs incubated with RCoV-AT1 with or without CXCR2 inhibitor (SB265610) was analyzed by (B) annexin V-FITC binding and (C) caspase 3 activity using a luminescent substrate assay. Luminescence data were normalized to PMNs incubated in RPMI. Data shown are means 6 SEM from at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance versus RCoV-AT1: *P , 0.05, **P , 0.01, and ***P , 0.001. However, CXCR2-dependent chemotaxis does not differ in response to fixed monomeric or dimeric forms of CXCL8 (21) . We show that neutralizing antibodies completely inhibited PMN chemotaxis toward the four recombinant CXC chemokines when combined at concentrations equivalent to that in RCoV-AT1 medium ( Figure 3D ). During inflammatory responses, the apoptotic program of PMNs can be delayed, thereby prolonging their functional lifespan but also contributing to pathology. This is in contrast to other viruses that directly alter the apoptosis program of PMNs. Furthermore, we showed that incubation of PMNs in RCoV-AT1 with a CXCR2 inhibitor (SB265610) reversed apoptosis inhibition. Multiple studies have demonstrated CXC chemokine-mediated inhibition of PMN apoptosis. Apoptosis of rat PMNs is inhibited by culture in CXCL1, and this effect is reversed by pretreatment with SB265610, confirming that CXCR2 signaling is required for apoptosis inhibition (19, 23, 29) . In contrast, other proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-6, significantly induce PMN apoptosis (41) (42) (43) . When apoptosis was evaluated at time points before 8 hours, TNF-a promoted PMN apoptosis. Other studies have described caspase 8-dependent spontaneous PMN apoptosis, involving ligand-independent clustering of death receptors (24) . Thus, our observations that caspase 8 and 9 activities are inhibited by incubation of PMNs in RCoV-AT1 can suggest that the intrinsic pathway, whereby caspase 9 activation leads to caspase 8 activation, or both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are involved.

The effect of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) on the release of IL-8 from BEAS-2B cells and primary human bronchial epithelial cells after stimulation with polyinosinepolycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a synthetic analog of viral dsRNA and a ligand for TLR3, and the signal transduction were examined. One hundred to 150 mM H 2 O 2 significantly potentiated the release of IL-8 from the epithelial cells after stimulation with 10 mg\/ml poly(I:C). The H 2 O 2 -augmented IL-8 release was inhibited by treatment with N-acetylcysteine. One hundred micromoles of H 2 O 2 enhanced the translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB p65, but not that of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), into the nucleus and the NF-kB DNA binding activity after poly(I:C) stimulation, which effect was inhibited not by the silencing of IRF-3 but by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, or dexamethasone. One hundred micromoles of H 2 O 2 potentiated the TLR3 expression on the airway epithelial cells treated with poly(I:C).

Modulation of this pathway may be a therapeutic target for viral-induced exacerbations of COPD.","text_body":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the world, and further increases in its prevalence and mortality can be expected in the coming decades (1) . Many patients with COPD experience periodical exacerbations, which are worsenings of their symptoms such as cough, sputum, and\/or dyspnea, causing an acute deterioration in lung function and airway inflammation (1) (2) (3) (4) . Preventing the exacerbations is necessary to inhibit the progression of the disease and to reduce medical expenses for hospitalization during exacerbations (3) (4) (5) . However, the precise mechanism of these exacerbations has not been fully elucidated.\r\n In COPD, inflammatory cells including macrophages, neutrophils, and CD8-positive lymphocytes are involved in the pathophysiology of the airway inflammation. These cells are activated by cigarette smoke and release proteases including neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinases, which break down connective tissue in the lung parenchyma and stimulate mucus hypersecretion (6, 7) . Oxidants derived from cigarette smoke or released by inflammatory cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of COPD (6) and, in fact, oxidative stress markers including hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) are elevated in the airways of patients with COPD (8) (9) (10) (11) . During exacerbations, greater amounts of H 2 O 2 are produced in the airways of patients with COPD than those in the stable disease condition (12, 13) . In addition, antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and carbocysteine have been shown to reduce the number of COPD exacerbations (14, 15) , suggesting that oxidative stress might be involved in the exacerbation of COPD.\r\n Recently, viral infections including rhinovirus, corona virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza virus have been demonstrated to be a major cause of COPD exacerbations (16, 17) . In addition, the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in recognizing the pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8, has been demonstrated in innate immunity (18, 19) . Especially, TLR3 reacts with viral-derived double-strand RNA (dsRNA) and is thought to play a key role in the viral infection in the respiratory system (20) (21) (22) . The expression of TLR3 has been detected on airway epithelial cells, dendric cells, and macrophages (20, 22) . When TLR3 is activated, both nuclear factor (NF)-kB and interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) are translocated into the nucleus and activate their DNA binding (18, 21, 23) . The former has been reported to regulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a, IL-1b, and the potent neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 (24) . The latter regulates the expression of type I interferon (IFN) (23) . Although both oxidative stress and viral infection are involved in the exacerbations in COPD, it has been not elucidated whether oxidative stress potentiates the TLR signaling and mediator production.\r\n IL-8 is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant and is related to the accumulation of neutrophils in the airways of patients with COPD (25) . In patients with COPD, the levels of IL-8 in sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, exhaled breath condensate, and serum are elevated compared with healthy subjects (26) (27) (28) (29) , and the level is further increased during exacerbations (28, 30, 31) , which leads to airway neutrophilia (32, 33) . Airway epithelial cells produce large amounts of IL-8, and TLR3 activation induces IL-8 production in airway epithelial cells (21, 22) .\r\n The present study, therefore, was designed to determine, using a synthetic dsRNA, polyinosinic-cystidic acid [poly(I:C)], the following: (1) whether oxidative stress could affect the\r\n Oxidative stress can augment the response of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in airway epithelial cells via NF-kB, and this effect might be partly mediated by the enhancement of TLR3 expression.

(St. Louis, MO).\r\n The human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B cells) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Four strains of primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) were purchased from Cell Aplications, Inc. (San Diego, CA) and ScienCell research laboratories (Carlsbad, CA). BEAS-2B cells (passages [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] or HBEpC (passages 3-7) were cultured in serum-free Keratinocyte Basal Medium supplemented with 10 ng\/ml recombinant epidermal growth factor and 30 mg\/ml bovine pituitary extract. Cells were cultured at 378C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 and passaged. Cells were routinely grown to 80% confluence and growth arrested overnight before experimental procedures by transfer to growth factorfree media. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates for investigation of the effect of poly(I:C)-induced IL-8 release. To investigate the effect of poly(I:C)-induced IL-8 release, the supernatants were harvested at 24 hours after treatment with poly(I:C) and stored at 2808C until the measurement. To estimate the effect of H 2 O 2 on the poly(I:C)-induced IL-8 release, H 2 O 2 was added to the media 30 minutes before the treatment with poly(I:C) (34) . To evaluate the effects of bafilomycin, NAC, MG132, and DEX, these drugs were added to the media at various concentrations 30 minutes before H 2 O 2 or poly(I:C) treatment.\r\n Cells were seeded in 8-well chamber slides at a density of 1 3 10 5 \/ml and cultured for 24 hours, and then the medium was replaced with growth factor-free media for a further 24 hours. After washing with PBS, the slides were fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. The slides were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. The slides were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature by 5% BSA and then rinsed. The slides were then incubated overnight with goat polyclonal anti-TLR3 antibody (10 mg\/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 48C. After washing with PBS, the slides were incubated with FITCconjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG antibodies (1: 2,000 dilution; Sigma) for 1 hour at room temperature. Nuclei of the cells were stained with PI (1 mg\/ml). The slides were then viewed with an epifluorescence microscope (E-800; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and photographed with a digital camera (DMX-1200C; Nikon) under 3400 magnification.\r\n Cells were treated with 10 mg\/ml poly(I:C) in the presence or absence of 100 mM H 2 O 2 for 24 hours. After washing with HBSS, cells were homogenized in cell lysis buffer (0.05% Triton X, 35 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.4 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mg\/ml aprotinin, and 1 mg\/ml leupeptin) at 48C. Samples were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Equal amounts of protein and recombinant human TLR3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for positive control were loaded and separated by electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the separated proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Goat polyclonal anti-TLR3 antibody (0.2 mg\/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or mouse monoclonal anti-b-actin antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Sigma) were used for the detection of target proteins. Peroxidase-conjugated appropriate secondary antibodies were used. Binding antibodies were detected using ECL-plus (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) and visualized with a chemiluminescence imaging system (Luminocapture AE6955; Atto Co., Tokyo, Japan). Each band intensity was quantified by densitometry (Image J; NIH, Frederick, MD).\r\n One milligram per milliliter of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was prepared using HBSS. Once the supernatants had been removed from the cells, 50 ml MTT solution were added to each well. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at 378C, after which the MTT solution was discarded. Fifty microliters of DMSO were added to each well. The product was quantified at 550 nm with a microplate reader.\r\n IL-8 was measured in the supernatants using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lower detection limit was 16 pg\/ml.\r\n Cells were treated with 10 mg\/ml poly(I:C) in the presence or absence of 100 mM H 2 O 2 for 0 to 120 minutes. After washing with HBSS, cells were homogenized in cell lysis buffer to obtain the nuclear fraction using Nuclear Extraction Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were separated by electrophoresis and blotted on a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). The following antibodies were used for detection of the target proteins: mouse monoclonal anti-NF-kB p65 antibody (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-IRF-3 antibody (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or mouse monoclonal anti-lamin A\/C antibody (1:400 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Peroxidase-conjugated appropriate secondary antibodies were used. The following detection and visualization procedures were performed the same as for TLR3 immunoblotting.\r\n To assess NF-kB p65 DNA binding activity, nuclear fraction was obtained after 60 minutes of incubation with poly(I:C) or vehicle and evaluated by NF-kB p65 transcription factor assay kit, which is based on the method of ELISA (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI) accord-ing to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, equal amounts of nuclear extract were added on 96-well plates which immobilized a specific double-stranded DNA sequence containing the NF-kB response element on the bottom. After incubation and washing, the plates were incubated with anti-human NF-kB p65 primary antibody. Then a goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was used. After developing, the plates were read at 450 nm with a microplate reader.\r\n Cells were seeded in 6-well plates in complete media. At 50% confluence, transfection with siRNA was performed. In one tube, 40 ml of lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) were mixed gently with 1.5 ml Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. In a separate tube, 975 pmol of either nontargeting or IRF-3 siRNA (SMART pool plus; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) were mixed gently with 1.5 ml Opti-MEM medium. These siRNA and lipofectamine solutions were then combined, gently mixed, and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. After incubation, 2 ml of DMEM were added to obtain a final volume of 5 ml (final concentration of siRNAs 5 200 nM), which was added to each dish. Cells were then incubated at 378C for 6 hours. After that, media were changed to serum-free Keratinocyte Basal Medium with growth factor and further cultured for 24 hours. The siRNA-treated cells were then used to assess the role of the IRF-3 on IL-8 release in the presence of 10 mg\/ml poly(I:C) or to assess IRF-3 expression by immunoblotting.\r\n Data were expressed as means 6 SEM. GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) was used to perform all statistical tests. Experiments with multiple comparisons were evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test to adjust for multiple comparisons. A paired two-group Student's t test was used for single comparisons. Probability values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. \r\n Expression of TLR3 on Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells and Effect of TLR3 Ligand, Poly(I:C) on IL-8 Release\r\n To confirm whether human bronchial epithelial cells express TLR3, we first examined the expression of TLR3 by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting. TLR3 was detected in BEAS-2B cells by immunocytochemistry ( Figure 1A ). TLR3 was detected at approximately 110 kD by immunoblotting in BEAS-2B cells and HBEpC as previously reported ( Figure 1B ). Next, we investigated the effect of the TLR3 ligand, poly(I:C) on the release of IL-8 from BEAS-2B cells. Poly(I:C) significantly increased the release of IL-8 from the epithelial cells in a dosedependent manner (Figure 2A ). TLR3 has been reported to exist in the endosome and to require an acidic environment for its activation. To confirm whether the effect of poly(I:C) was mediated through TLR, we used bafilomycin, which is an inhibitor of endosomal acidification. Bafilomycin dose-dependently inhibited the poly(I:C)-induced IL-8 release ( Figure 2B) . We examined the effect of other TLR ligands, including LPS(TLR4), R837(TLR7), and R848(TLR7\/8), on the release of IL-8. LPS ( Figure 2C ), R837 ( Figure 2D ), or R848 ( Figure 2E ) had no effect on the release of IL-8 from the epithelial cells. To explore the mechanism for the H 2 O 2 -augmented IL-8 release in the poly(I:C)-treated cells, the effect of H 2 O 2 on the translocation of NF-kB and IRF-3 into the nucleus was evaluated. Treatment with H 2 O 2 caused a small but significant increase in NF-kB p65 translocation into the nucleus ( Figures  4A-4D) . However, H 2 O 2 significantly potentiated NF-kB p65 translocation into the nucleus in the presence of poly(I:C) in a time-and concentration-dependent manner (Figures 4A-4D) . The potentiation of NF-kB translocation was not observed after 24 hours of H 2 O 2 treatment ( Figure E2 ). H 2 O 2 also significantly potentiated NF-kB DNA binding activity in the presence of poly(I:C) ( Figure 4E ). Furthermore, pretreatment with MG132 significantly inhibited the H 2 O 2 -augmented IL-8 release in the poly(I:C)-treated cells ( Figure 4F) . Figures 5A and 5B ). Since there is no available inhibitor for IRF-3, siRNA, for IRF3 was used to estimate the inhibitory effect on the release of IL-8. Although treatment with siRNA eliminated the IRF-3 protein ( Figure 5C ), IRF-3 knockdown did not affect the H 2 O 2 -augmented IL-8 release in the poly(I:C)-treated cells ( Figure 5D ).\r\n To explore another mechanism of the H 2 O 2 -potentiated IL-8 release in the poly(I:C)-treated cells, the effect of H 2 O 2 on the expression of TLR3 in the epithelial cells was evaluated. Treatment with 100 mM H 2 O 2 or 10 mg\/ml poly(I:C) alone did not affect the expression of TLR3 ( Figure 6A ). However, combination of poly(I:C) and H 2 O 2 significantly increased the TLR3 expression in a time-dependent manner ( Figures 6A and 6B) . \r\n We confirmed the potentiation by H 2 O 2 on the IL-8 release, NF-kB translocation, and TLR3 expression in HBEpC. Treatment with H 2 O 2 slightly but significantly augmented IL-8 release in the poly(I:C)-treated cells ( Figure 7A ). H 2 O 2 also significantly potentiated the poly(I:C)-augmented NF-kB p65 translocation and TLR3 expression in the poly(I:C)-treated cells as well as in BEAS-2B cells (Figures 7B and 7C) .\r\n In the current study, we demonstrated the expression of TLR3 on BEAS-2B cells and HBEpC and that a synthetic dsRNA, During exacerbations of COPD, levels of IL-8 in sputum and exhaled breath condensate were elevated (28, 30, 31) and neutrophil infiltration was augmented in the airways (32, 33) . Although the mechanism for this enhanced neutrophilic inflammation has not been fully elucidated yet, our findings may explain the mechanism. Generally, greater amounts of oxygen radicals are produced during exacerbations compared with the stable condition (12, 13) . When viral infections occur, TLR3-mediated IL-8 release might further increase in the airways and consequently lead to excessive neutrophil accumulation.\r\n In the current study, H 2 O 2 augmented the poly(I:C)-induced translocation of NF-kB p65 into the nucleus and suppression of NF-kB by MG132 inhibited the H 2 O 2 -augmented IL-8 release in the poly(I:C)-treated cells. These results suggest that the augmentation of IL-8 release by H 2 O 2 is due to the potentiation of poly(I:C)-induced NF-kB activation. In previous studies, H 2 O 2 has been reported not only to directly induce the NF-kB transcriptional activity (37) , but also enhance NF-kB activation in response to proinflammatory cytokines (38, 39) . The molecular mechanisms by which H 2 O 2 potentiates NF-kB signaling remain uncertain, but several possible mechanisms have been reported. Takada and coworkers showed that H 2 O 2 activates NF-kB through tyrosine phosphorylation of IkBa and serine phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-kB (39) . Others have also reported that H 2 O 2 activates NF-kB via phosphorylation of serine residues in the IkB kinases (IKKs) (40) . Recently, H 2 O 2 has been reported to prolong nuclear localization of NF-kB in proinflammatory cytokine-activated cells by suppressing the negative regulation by IkBa and other proteases (41) . In our current study, H 2 O 2 -augmented NF-kB p65 translocation to the nucleus in poly(I:C)-treated cells continued until 120 minutes compared with the control, which might be consistent with the previous study (41) . We showed that poly(I:C) induced the translocation of IRF3 into the nucleus, but H 2 O 2 did not enhance this translocation. Further silencing of IRF-3 did not affect the potentiation of IL-8 release. Together, potentiation of IL-8 release is mainly mediated via NF-kB but not IRF-3 signaling.\r\n In the present study, we showed that the combination of poly(I:C) and H 2 O 2 significantly enhanced TLR3 expression in airway epithelial cells. This result suggests that oxidative stress might affect the regulation of TLR3 expression. Previous reports have shown that poly(I:C) augments TLR3 expression in epithelial cells through a type I IFN-dependent mechanism (21, 42) . Oxidative stress also has been reported to enhance TLR3 expression in adult human astrocytes (43) . These reports might support the current results. Recently, increased TLR3 expression has been observed in airway epithelial cells from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome in which airway cells are exposed to a hyperoxic condition (44) , suggesting that oxidative stress might modulate TLR3 expression. However, there have not been any studies to clarify the mechanism of this modulation in epithelial cells. In the current study, DEX did not affect the H 2 O 2 -potentiated TLR3 expression. This might suggest that steroid-sensitive signals such as NF-kB are not involved in the mechanism of H 2 O 2 -potentiated TLR3 expression. However, this mechanism remains unclear and further studies are needed.\r\n In the current study, we investigated the time course of potentiation by H 2 O 2 in IL-8 release and TLR3 expression to examine whether potentiation in the IL-8 release by H 2 O 2 is due to up-regulation of TLR3 expression in the poly(I:C)treated cells. While the TLR3 expression was potentiated by H 2 O 2 at 16 hours or later, potentiation of the IL-8 release occurred at 4 to 8 hours or later. These results suggest that the potentiation of the IL-8 release by H 2 O 2 was mainly mediated by the potentiation of NF-kB activation. However, at 16 hours or later, the enhanced TLR3 expression might contribute to the potentiation of IL-8 release by H 2 O 2 .\r\n During acute exacerbations, patients with COPD usually are treated with steroids, and steroids have been reported to improve the severity of exacerbations (35, 36) . In this study, DEX dose-dependently inhibited the poly(I:C)-induced IL-8 release from epithelial cells. The inhibition of the IL-8 release by DEX in the H 2 O 2 -pretreated and poly(I:C)-exposed cells was less than in the vehicle-pretreated and poly(I:C)-exposed cells, suggesting that oxidative stress reduces the effect of steroid on the IL-8 release. The acquirement of steroid resistance under oxidative stress has been reported to occur in macrophages and epithelial cells via inactivation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) (34, 45) . This inactivation of HDAC2 by oxidative stress might explain our result that DEX was less effective in the H 2 O 2 -treated cells.\r\n Recently, several reports have shown the role of TLR activation under oxidative stress. Chen and colleagues have reported that the production of cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-8 is increased in alveolar macrophages from smokers after poly(I:C) stimulation compared with those from nonsmokers (46) . In a murine model, depletion of TLR3 was demonstrated to inhibit the smoking-enhanced airway inflammation and remodeling after influenza virus infection (47) . This result suggests that oxidative stress from cigarette smoke might enhance the TLR3 signaling, which is consistent with our results.\r\n In a recent report, Zmijewski and coworkers have shown that H 2 O 2 has an anti-inflammatory effect and prevents the activation of NF-kB (48) , which is inconsistent with the result of our current study. They demonstrated that a catalase inhibitor, aminotriazole, increased the production of reactive oxygen species in murine neutrophils and attenuated LPS-induced acute lung injury in a murine model. This effect was due to the alleviation of NF-kB activity and proinflammatory cytokine production in neutrophils. The discrepancy from our current results might be explained as follows. First, we administered H 2 O 2 exogenously to the airway epithelial cells, whereas they evaluated the role of endogenously produced H 2 O 2 by the inhibition of catalase in the reactive oxygen species production from neutrophils. Moreover, the inhibition of catalase might affect the antioxidant system, including glutathione and superoxide dismutase. Second, they evaluated the role of catalase inhibition in NF-kB signaling and proinflammatory cytokine production in murine neutrophils. We assessed the role of H 2 O 2 in NF-kB signaling and IL-8 production in human bronchial epithelial cells. Differences in the species and cell type might have affected the results. Third, we assessed TLR3 signaling in the current study. They showed the effect of catalase inhibition on lung inflammation induced by LPS treatment. In general, LPS stimulates TLR4; therefore, the discrepancies in the results might be due to the difference in activated TLRs.\r\n In the current study, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR7\/8 ligands did not enhance IL-8 release from BEAS-2B cells. Previously, Sha and colleagues have shown that 1 mg\/ml LPS treatment slightly potentiated the IL-8 release from the cells (49) . Generally, this concentration appears quite high. In the current study, we used 100 ng\/ml LPS to stimulate IL-8 release in BEAS-2B cells. Therefore, the lack of augmentation in IL-8 release by LPS could be due to the difference in the LPS concentration. In a recent report, Koff and coworkers have shown that TLR1\/2, TLR5, and TLR6\/2 ligands augment IL-8 release, albeit to a lesser extent than TLR3 stimulation in human bronchial epithelial cells (50) . Therefore, not only TLR3 ligand but also other TLR ligands could stimulate IL-8 release in human bronchial epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of TLR3 activation induced by viral infection under oxidative stress. Therefore, we investigated only TLR3 signaling, not other TLRs.\r\n There are several limitations in the current study. First, H 2 O 2 potentiated IL-8 production in the poly(I:C)-treated cells through the activation of NF-kB. However, it remains unclear whether the potentiation of H 2 O 2 in NF-kB activation is synergetic or not. Second, TLR3 was up-regulated by the H 2 O 2 plus poly(I:C) treatment for 24 hours in epithelial cells in the current study. However, the role of the up-regulated TLR3 in the IL-8 release could not be fully elucidated. Because TLR3 expression was augmented at 16 hours or later by treatment with H 2 O 2 and poly(I:C), the augmentation of the expression may affect the IL-8 release.\r\n In conclusion, we showed that oxidative stress potentiates the poly(I:C)-induced IL-8 release from airway epithelial cells through the augmentation of NF-kB signaling and that this potentiation might be partly explained by the enhancement of TLR3 expression. These results suggest that oxidative stress augments the neutrophilic inflammation in the airways of patients with COPD during viral-induced exacerbations. Modulation of this pathway may be a therapeutic target for exacerbations of COPD.\r\n Conflict of Interest Statement: None of the authors has a financial relationship with a commercial entity that has an interest in the subject of this manuscript.","sha":"f623e6c305c309f6a67f951764b43f8d5a1e19c1","publish_time":"2010-06-01","authors":"Koarai, Akira; Sugiura, Hisatoshi; Yanagisawa, Satoru; Ichikawa, Tomohiro; Minakata, Yoshiaki; Matsunaga, Kazuto; Hirano, Tsunahiko; Akamatsu, Keiichiro; Ichinose, Masakazu","journal":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","doi":"10.1165\/rcmb.2008-0345oc","Title":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","H index":147.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the world, and further increases in its prevalence and mortality can be expected in the coming decades (1) . Preventing the exacerbations is necessary to inhibit the progression of the disease and to reduce medical expenses for hospitalization during exacerbations (3) (4) (5) . During exacerbations, greater amounts of H 2 O 2 are produced in the airways of patients with COPD than those in the stable disease condition (12, 13) . Four strains of primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) were purchased from Cell Aplications, Inc. (San Diego, CA) and ScienCell research laboratories (Carlsbad, CA). BEAS-2B cells (passages [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] or HBEpC (passages 3-7) were cultured in serum-free Keratinocyte Basal Medium supplemented with 10 ng\/ml recombinant epidermal growth factor and 30 mg\/ml bovine pituitary extract. Cells were cultured at 378C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 and passaged. Cells were seeded in 8-well chamber slides at a density of 1 3 10 5 \/ml and cultured for 24 hours, and then the medium was replaced with growth factor-free media for a further 24 hours. After washing with PBS, the slides were fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. The slides were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature by 5% BSA and then rinsed. The slides were then incubated overnight with goat polyclonal anti-TLR3 antibody (10 mg\/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 48C. After washing with PBS, the slides were incubated with FITCconjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG antibodies (1: 2,000 dilution; Sigma) for 1 hour at room temperature. The slides were then viewed with an epifluorescence microscope (E-800; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and photographed with a digital camera (DMX-1200C; Nikon) under 3400 magnification. After washing with HBSS, cells were homogenized in cell lysis buffer (0.05% Triton X, 35 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.4 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mg\/ml aprotinin, and 1 mg\/ml leupeptin) at 48C. Samples were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After electrophoresis, the separated proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Goat polyclonal anti-TLR3 antibody (0.2 mg\/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or mouse monoclonal anti-b-actin antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Sigma) were used for the detection of target proteins. Peroxidase-conjugated appropriate secondary antibodies were used. Once the supernatants had been removed from the cells, 50 ml MTT solution were added to each well. The product was quantified at 550 nm with a microplate reader. Cells were treated with 10 mg\/ml poly(I:C) in the presence or absence of 100 mM H 2 O 2 for 0 to 120 minutes. The following detection and visualization procedures were performed the same as for TLR3 immunoblotting. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates in complete media. At 50% confluence, transfection with siRNA was performed. Cells were then incubated at 378C for 6 hours. GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) was used to perform all statistical tests. Experiments with multiple comparisons were evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test to adjust for multiple comparisons. Probability values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. Poly(I:C) significantly increased the release of IL-8 from the epithelial cells in a dosedependent manner (Figure 2A ). Furthermore, pretreatment with MG132 significantly inhibited the H 2 O 2 -augmented IL-8 release in the poly(I:C)-treated cells ( Figure 4F) . To explore another mechanism of the H 2 O 2 -potentiated IL-8 release in the poly(I:C)-treated cells, the effect of H 2 O 2 on the expression of TLR3 in the epithelial cells was evaluated. Although the mechanism for this enhanced neutrophilic inflammation has not been fully elucidated yet, our findings may explain the mechanism.

One of the major cell types to be infected is the alveolar type II cell. However, the innate immune response of primary human alveolar epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV has not been defined. Our objectives included developing a culture system permissive for SARS-CoV infection in primary human type II cells and defining their innate immune response. Culturing primary human alveolar type II cells at an airliquid interface (A\/L) improved their differentiation and greatly increased their susceptibility to infection, allowing us to define their primary interferon and chemokine responses. Viral antigens were detected in the cytoplasm of infected type II cells, electron micrographs demonstrated secretory vesicles filled with virions, virus RNA concentrations increased with time, and infectious virions were released by exocytosis from the apical surface of polarized type II cells. A marked increase was evident in the mRNA concentrations of interferon-b and interferon-l (IL-29) and in a large number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A surprising finding involved the variability of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, the SARS-CoV receptor, in type II cells from different donors. In conclusion, the cultivation of alveolar type II cells at an air-liquid interface provides primary cultures in which to study the pulmonary innate immune responses to infection with SARS-CoV, and to explore possible therapeutic approaches to modulating these innate immune responses.","text_body":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) produces devastating pneumonia with a marked inflammatory cytokine response and a mortality rate of about 10%. Alveolar epithelial cells are known to be susceptible in vivo, but the extent of infection for submerged primary cultures of human type II cells was too limited to define the cytokine and interferon responses to infection. This report demonstrates that primary human alveolar type II cells can be productively infected with SARS-CoV, and that they can generate a vigorous innate immune response. The critical feature for infecting human type II cells with SARS-CoV involves maintaining and infecting the cells under air-liquid interface conditions. Among our unexpected findings, the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, the receptor for SARS-CoV, was quite variable among different individuals, and cells from different donors differed in their susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection.\r\n of the alveoli and conducting airways (where the virus replicates in vivo) or by inflammatory cells recruited to the site of virus infection in the lung. Based on in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, He and colleagues suggested that ACE2positive infected cells in lungs of patients with SARS are the source of proinflammatory cytokines (27) .\r\n The primary goal of this research was to define the innate immune response of human alveolar type II cells to SARS-CoV. In our earlier study with submerged human alveolar type II cells on inserts, we detected a very low percentage of infected cells and could not evaluate their innate immune response (18) . However, culturing and infecting the type II cell at an air-liquid interface (A\/L) allowed for significant infection and characterization of their innate immune response. The robust innate immune response of these cells to SARS-CoV infection consisted of marked elevations in mRNA concentrations of interferon-b, interferon-l, CXCL10, CXCL11, and IL-6, and these results mirror findings reported in the lungs and sera of patients with SARS (22, 23, 25) .\r\n Lungs were obtained from deidentified patients whose lungs had been deemed unsuitable for transplantation and were donated for medical research. The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at National Jewish Health has deemed that the use of human lung cells from deidentified lung donors does not constitute human subject research, and is therefore exempt from Institutional Review Board approval. (Correspondence to this effect from the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at National Jewish Health is available upon request).\r\n Cells were isolated as previously described (28, 29) . Isolated cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and plated at a density of 1 3 10 6 per cm 2 on sixwell or 24-well Millicell inserts (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) precoated with a mixture of 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and 50% rat-tail collagen. After cell adherence for 48 hours, the medium was switched for 2 days to 5% heat-inactivated human serum plus 10 ng\/ml keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), 0.1 mM isobutylmethyl xanthine, 0.1 mM 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), 10 ng\/ml IL-4, and 10 ng\/ml IL-13. At this time, cultures were converted to A\/L conditions. Cells were incubated for an additional 4 days with medium containing KIA, IL-4, IL-13, and 10 nM dexamethasone (D). After 8 days of culture on the inserts and 6 days under A\/ L conditions, cells were used for virus inoculation or harvested.\r\n The Urbani strain of SARS-CoV was kindly provided by Dr. Bellini at the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA), and was propagated in Vero E6 cells. All work with infectious SARS-CoV was performed in the Biosafety Level 3 suite at the School of Medicine, University of Colorado (Aurora, CO). type II cells were inoculated on the apical surface with 250 ml per six-well plate insert (or 50 ml per 24-well plate insert) of KIAD with IL-4-supplemented and IL-13-supplemented medium containing SARS-CoV (1 3 10 7 plaque-forming units (pfu)\/ml). After 4 hours of incubation at 37 8 C, the virus inocula and control media were aspirated from the apical cell surface, and cultures were incubated for a total of 24 or 48 hours after virus inoculation under A\/L conditions, after which they were extracted to analyze viral and cellular RNA, or fixed and assayed via electron microscopy or immunofluorescent labeling with antibodies to viral or cell proteins. The yield of infectious virus was titered in washes of apical cell surfaces and basal medium by plaque assays on Vero E6 cells.\r\n The methods for immunocytochemistry, the quantitation of infected cells, virus production, plaque assays, the isolation of RNA, quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, surface biotinylation, and statistical analysis are described in the online supplement.\r\n In our initial studies on SARS-CoV infection with human alveolar type II cells in traditional submerged cultures, we detected only a very low level of infection. Subsequently, we evaluated a variety of changes in the culture system to improve the rate of infection. We found that susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection and the maintenance of differentiation were achieved by culturing cells at an A\/L on Millicell inserts coated with a matrix of rat-tail collagen and Matrigel, and by providing a medium that contained IL-13 and IL-4 as well as KGF, isomethylbutyl xanthine, 8 Br-cAMP, dexamethasone, and 5% heat-inactivated human serum (30) . Cells contained readily identifiable lamellar bodies according to phase microscopy ( Figure 1A ). In general, increased type II cell differentiation was observed, as evidenced by the expression of the surfactant proteins (SPs) ( Figure 1B ). As shown in Figure 1B , the air-liquid interface condition increased the expression of ACE2, SP-A, proSP-B, proSP-C, and ABCA3, but not fattyacid synthase, compared with the submerged condition in this experiment. However, the magnitude of effect of the A\/L condition was more variable with human type II cells than with our experiments on primary rat type II cells (31) ( Figure E1 in the online supplement). In addition, we found an increase in ACE2 expression in our cultures after adding IL-4 and IL-13, a finding that differs from results with Vero E6 cells regarding the effect of IL-13 on ACE2 expression (32) ( Figure 1B ). In general, the level of ACE2 expression, as measured by immunoblotting of wholecell extracts, was slightly increased in type II cells cultured under A\/L conditions, but ACE2 concentrations varied considerably between cells from individual donors ( Figure E1 ). However, according to flow cytometry and surface biotinylation, we were unable to detect any increase in the surface expression of ACE2 in cells maintained under A\/L conditions, compared with cells maintained in submerged cultures (data not shown).\r\n To test whether type II cells cultured at the A\/L were more susceptible to SARS-CoV infection than type II cells in submerged cultures (18) , human type II cells cultured at an A\/L on six-well inserts were inoculated on the apical surface with 250 ml of medium containing SARS-CoV at an estimated multiplicity of 2 pfu\/ cell, and allowed to adsorb for 4 hours at 37 8 C. Then the apical fluid and inoculum were aspirated, and cells were maintained under A\/L conditions. SARS-CoV reproducibly caused productive infection of the primary human alveolar type II cells cultured at the A\/L. We found little evidence of infection at 4 hours after virus inoculation, but by 24 hours after virus inoculation, infected cells containing viral antigens in the cytoplasm were readily detected. SARS-CoV-infected cells were readily observed in all primary alveolar type II cultures on Millicell inserts at the A\/L, although the percentages of infected cells varied considerably in different areas of the same insert and between different human donors. In four donors, the percentage of cells infected ranged from 3.4-34.2% at 24 hours, and from 2.4-27.2% at 48 hours.\r\n To demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-infected cells were type II cells, we used antibodies to several type II cell differentiation markers, namely, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), SP-A, and E-cadherin. Nearly 100% of the cells expressed SP-A. Dual labeling showed that the infected cells were epithelial and expressed TTF-1 and SP-A ( Figure 2 ). These markers were chosen because they could be readily detected in the methanol-fixed cells required for identifying the viral antigens, and could be used with the rabbit antibody to the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein. In all experiments, only a portion of the cells were infected, and it was not clear why some cells were infected and others were not. We were not certain if this discrepancy was related to the level of ACE2 expression.\r\n Coronavirus RNA is synthesized in virus-induced doublemembrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The virions bud intracellularly from membranes of the ER-Golgi-intermediate compartment, are transported through the cytoplasm in secretory vesicles, and are released from cells by an exocytic process. Some coronaviruses are released from polarized epithelial cells by exocytosis at the apical plasma membrane, whereas others are released at basolateral membranes (33) . Virions do not bud from the plasma membrane, although released virions often remain adherent to the plasma membrane of infected cells.\r\n To document definitively that the SARS-CoV-infected cells in these alveolar type II cultures at the A\/L were type II cells, we inoculated the cell cultures at the A\/L with SARS-CoV, fixed and embedded them in plastic, sectioned them perpendicular to the insert, and observed them with the electron microscope. Coronavirus virions, approximately 100 nm in diameter, were observed within numerous secretory vesicles in cells that also contained lamellar bodies, the definitive morphologic feature of type II cells (Figure 3 ). The characteristic doublemembrane vesicles that comprise the sites of viral RNA replication are depicted in Figure 3B (34, 35) , and virions were observed budding into vesicles ( Figure 3A ) and adsorbed to the apical membrane ( Figure 3B ).\r\n To analyze SARS-CoV infection in type II cells at an A\/L, we used both real-time quantitative PCR and plaque assays ( Figure  4 ). Quantitative real-time PCR revealed a consistent 1.5 log increase in viral mRNA at 24 hours after inoculation, as shown for six donors ( Figure 4A ). Each donor was deidentified and received a number. Most donors were used for only one type of experiment because of the limited number cells isolated from each donor. Cells were isolated from more than 20 donors in the course of these experiments.\r\n Because no medium was recoverable from the cells at the A\/L, we washed the apical surface at designated times after virus inoculation, and titered the released virus in the apical wash as well as in the basolateral medium by a plaque assay. Equally high yields of released virus from the apical wash and cell-associated virus from the frozen and thawed samples were detected at 24 hours, and the virus titers in specimens harvested at 48 hours were lower but similar. Very little virus was detected in the basolateral medium ( Figure 4B ).\r\n Concentrations of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been reported to be increased in the lungs and sera of patients with SARS (22, 23, 25, 26) . Because alveolar type II cells at the A\/L were readily infected by SARS-CoV, we were able to measure changes in expression of selected genes of the innate immune system in these cells in response to SARS-CoV infection ( Figure 5 ). For technical and biosafety reasons, we did not attempt to measure concentrations of interferon or cytokine proteins from infected cultures. The SARS-CoV infection of type II cells induced markedly increased concentrations of the mRNAs encoding type I and type III interferons, as well as the interferon-responsive genes ISG56, OAS1, Mx1, CXCL10, and CXCL11 ( Figure 5 ). The SARS-CoV infection of type II cultures also elicited large increases in the concentrations of chemokines that recruit inflammatory cells (CXCL8, CCL5, CXCL10, and CXCL11). Thus, human alveolar type II cells are capable of initiating robust innate immune responses that could contribute to the cytokines and chemokines measured in the lungs and sera of patients with SARS. In addition, chemoattractants released by epithelial cells would be expected to recruit inflammatory cells in vivo, and to initiate the innate immune response. \r\n The focus of these studies involved differentiated human type II cells, but we also performed a limited number of experiments to determine whether type I-like cells transdifferentiated from type II cells grown under A\/L conditions were also susceptible to SARS-CoV. In our previous study (18) , we detected no SARS-CoV infection of human alveolar type I-like cells under submerged conditions, and ACE2 protein expression was below the level of detection. In pilot experiments with unselected donors, we detected very little infection of type I-like cells under A\/L conditions at 24 hours after inoculation. However, when we undertook screening to select a donor (i.e., patient 101) who expressed a high concentration of ACE2 in the freshly isolated cells, we observed that transdifferentiated type I-like cells could be infected with SARS-CoV ( Figures E1 and E2) . Hence, these alveolar type I-like cells at the A\/L were also susceptible to SARS-CoV, although they were much less susceptible to infection than differentiated human type II cells.\r\n The goal of this study involved developing a primary culture system with human alveolar type II cells that was permissive to SARS-CoV infection, so that their innate immune response to infection could be defined. Human alveolar type II cells maintained at an A\/L were well differentiated (Figures 1-3) and permissive for SARS-CoV infection, as shown by immunocytochemistry, by increases in the synthesis of viral RNA and protein, and by the production and release of infectious virions. Although the air-liquid interface culture conditions greatly increased the susceptibility of type II cells to SARS-CoV, the mechanism for this increased susceptibility to infection is not yet established. In the lung, very little fluid is present on the apical surface of the alveolar epithelium (37, 38) . Hence, the A\/L conditions approximate conditions in vivo. A\/L culture conditions improved the differentiation state of type II alveolar epithelial cells in vitro, and greatly enhanced their susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection.\r\n Innate immunity serves as the first response to protect host cells from viral infection, and the characteristics of the innate immune response to a pathogen can significantly shape subsequent adaptive immune responses and affect the outcome of infection (39) . When the alveolar epithelium becomes infected, infected cells alert other cells and organs to the infection by secreting cytokines and chemokines. The infected epithelial cells are likely the first responders, and initiate the innate immune response. The earliest response of human alveolar type II cells to influenza virus infection involves the expression of interferon and interferon-responsive genes (40) . Presumably this interferon response increases the resistance of neighboring cells to infection. The next phase of the innate immune response involves the expression of cytokines, which can both attract and activate immune cells and stimulate neighboring cells to amplify the defensive response greatly by secreting additional cytokines and chemokines. The innate response also signals the bone marrow to release additional inflammatory cells and initiates the adaptive immune response to recruit antigen-specific lymphocytes. In this study, we measured the mRNAs encoding interferon-b and interferon-l, and both were markedly elevated in response to SARS-CoV infection. Both of these interferons have been reported to be elevated in experimental SARS-CoV infections in primates and in cell lines infected with SARS- CoV (15, 24, 41) . IL-29 is important in the innate immune response and may help control SARS-CoV infection (29, 41, 42) .\r\n The cytokine responses of human type II alveolar epithelial cells at the A\/L were similar to those detected in the sera and lungs of patients and in nonhuman primates infected with SARS-CoV (15, 24, 43) . He and colleagues suggested that resident ACE2expressing lung epithelial cells, and not the subsequently recruited inflammatory cells, constitute the primary source of elevated cytokines in patients infected with SARS-CoV, and that these epithelial-derived cytokines play an important role in the acute lung injury and pathogenesis of SARS (27) . Our data show that type II alveolar cells likely contribute to the high concentrations of cytokines and chemokines detected in the gas-exchange portion of the lungs in patients with SARS. In the sera of patients with SARS, the cytokine that increases most rapidly is CXCL10 (IP-10) (22, 23) . Similarly, in our type II cells at the A\/L, the level of CXCL10 mRNA expression increased more than 1,000 fold by 24 hours after virus inoculation ( Figure 5 ). The other cytokine that appears to predict the clinical course and outcome of SARS is IL-6 (43). The concentration of mRNA encoding IL-6 was elevated approximately 10-fold in our SARS-CoV-infected alveolar type II cultures at the A\/L ( Figure 5 ). In these particular experiments, we did not evaluate ultraviolet light-inactivated virus, but we knew from previous studies that type II cells do not present a cytokine or interferon response to ultraviolet light-inactivated influenza (40) . Additional studies will be required to define the cell-cell interactions whereby infected epithelial cells signal to nearby uninfected parenchymal cells or inflammatory cells. We found that rat alveolar type I-like cells infected with rat coronavirus stimulated noninfected cells in the culture to secrete cytokines and chemokines through an IL-1-dependent mechanism (30) . Paracrine signaling by IL-1, which is released from infected type II cells during the activation of the inflammasome, may also play important roles, both in protecting type II cells from infection and in amplifying the innate immune response.\r\n We explored the hypothesis that the increased rate of SARS-CoV infection in type II cells under A\/L conditions was attributable to an increased concentration of ACE2, the SARS-CoV receptor. We observed that type II cells from donors who expressed higher concentrations of ACE2 and from culture conditions that increased ACE2 expression generally correlated with a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection. However, we did not measure ACE2 concentrations in cells from enough different donors who were also inoculated with SARS-CoV, and we did not measure the extent of virus infection to prove this quantitatively. Although immunoblotting showed a modest but variable increase in ACE2 expression by type II cells when cultured at the A\/L compared with submerged conditons, we did not detect a consistent increase in the surface expression of ACE2 by either flow cytometry or surface biotinylation (data not shown). Similarly, when we transdifferentiated type II cells at the A\/L into type I-like cells that expressed very low levels of ACE2, we observed very little SARS-CoV infection. However, in type I-like cells transdifferentiated from a type II cell donor selected to express high concentrations of ACE2, we did observe the infection of type I-like cells (Figures E1 and E2 ). Because we did not demonstrate a clear increase in the surface expression of ACE2 under A\/L conditions, we cannot conclude that the enhanced role of infection of type II cells at the A\/L was attributable solely to the concentration of ACE2.\r\n We did not focus on the potential of adding IL-4 and IL-13 to these cultures. De Lang and colleagues reported that IL-4 and IL-13 decreased ACE2 expression in Vero E6 cells (32) . However, as shown in Figure 1 , we found that IL-4\/IL-13 actually increased ACE2 expression in our primary human alveolar type II cells. Hence, we added IL-4\/IL-13 to increase ACE2 expression and thereby increase SARS-CoV infection. We previously reported on the effects of IL-13 on human type II cells, and noted that IL-13 decreases SP-C and SP-D but exerts little effect on SP-A or SP-B (44) . The slight decrease in SP-D could enhance the SARS infection, although this is unlikely, based on our experiments with 229E-6V (another coronavirus), in which SP-D did not make a major difference in the 229E-6V infectability of human alveolar macrophages (45) . Nevertheless, SP-D has been reported to interact with the SARS spike glycoprotein, the attachment protein (46) .\r\n Alternatively, A\/L culture conditions may have increased the level of expression in some other coreceptor for SARS-CoV, such as CD209L (47) . In pilot experiments, we did not find a consistent increase in CD209L according to flow cytometry under A\/L conditions (data not shown). Another consideration involves the details of the inoculation and the volume of apical fluid. In the A\/L cultures, the inoculum was aspirated and cells were not washed, so some of the inoculum persisted in the surface fluid for the duration of the experiment. Perhaps the A\/L conditions facilitated multiple cycles of virus infection. For example, after the first cycle of virus replication, the newly synthesized virus would be released into the scant amount of fluid on the apical surface, and this concentrated virus might accelerate secondary rounds of infection. In pilot studies, we observed that an increased susceptibility of type II cells to SARS-CoV infection required A\/L culture conditions both before and after virus inoculation.\r\n Other investigators identified Oct-4-positive lung cells that could be infected with SARS-CoV (43, 48) . In neonatal mice, these cells expressed club cell secretory protein but not alveolar epithelial cell markers (48) . In human lung tissue, these cells did not express cytokeratin or surfactant proteins (43) . Our cells were different and did not express Oct-4 or the club cell secretory protein, but they expressed surfactant proteins and cytokeratin, and contained characteristic lamellar bodies.\r\n In conclusion, culturing at the A\/L renders primary human alveolar type II cells susceptible to productive SARS-CoV infection, and the cells mount a robust innate immune response, similar to that observed in the lungs and sera of patients with SARS. type II alveolar epithelial cells cultured at an A\/L offer an excellent in vitro system in which to isolate and propagate emerging respiratory viruses that present with fastidious requirements for growth in highly differentiated human lung cells. These cultures also provide excellent in vitro models in which to evaluate the effects of candidate therapeutics that target the innate immune responses to respiratory virus infection.\r\n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org. Figure 5 . Innate immune responses of alveolar type II cells to SARS-CoV infection. type II cells at an A\/L were cultured and inoculated with SARS-CoV, as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS. After the 4-hour inoculation period, the inoculum was aspirated, and cultures were harvested 6 and 24 hours later. The specific mRNA concentrations of chemokines and cytokines were measured by quantitative RT-PCR, and normalized to the constitutive probe 36B4 (acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein). The white bars represent data from mock-inoculated inserts, and the black bars represent data from SARS-CoV-infected inserts.

The primary goal of this research was to define the innate immune response of human alveolar type II cells to SARS-CoV. In our earlier study with submerged human alveolar type II cells on inserts, we detected a very low percentage of infected cells and could not evaluate their innate immune response (18) . The robust innate immune response of these cells to SARS-CoV infection consisted of marked elevations in mRNA concentrations of interferon-b, interferon-l, CXCL10, CXCL11, and IL-6, and these results mirror findings reported in the lungs and sera of patients with SARS (22, 23, 25) . Lungs were obtained from deidentified patients whose lungs had been deemed unsuitable for transplantation and were donated for medical research. The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at National Jewish Health has deemed that the use of human lung cells from deidentified lung donors does not constitute human subject research, and is therefore exempt from Institutional Review Board approval. ( Cells were isolated as previously described (28, 29) . The Urbani strain of SARS-CoV was kindly provided by Dr. Bellini at the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA), and was propagated in Vero E6 cells. We found that susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection and the maintenance of differentiation were achieved by culturing cells at an A\/L on Millicell inserts coated with a matrix of rat-tail collagen and Matrigel, and by providing a medium that contained IL-13 and IL-4 as well as KGF, isomethylbutyl xanthine, 8 Br-cAMP, dexamethasone, and 5% heat-inactivated human serum (30) . Cells contained readily identifiable lamellar bodies according to phase microscopy ( Figure 1A ). In addition, we found an increase in ACE2 expression in our cultures after adding IL-4 and IL-13, a finding that differs from results with Vero E6 cells regarding the effect of IL-13 on ACE2 expression (32) ( Figure 1B ). SARS-CoV-infected cells were readily observed in all primary alveolar type II cultures on Millicell inserts at the A\/L, although the percentages of infected cells varied considerably in different areas of the same insert and between different human donors. Virions do not bud from the plasma membrane, although released virions often remain adherent to the plasma membrane of infected cells. Each donor was deidentified and received a number. Most donors were used for only one type of experiment because of the limited number cells isolated from each donor. Cells were isolated from more than 20 donors in the course of these experiments. The focus of these studies involved differentiated human type II cells, but we also performed a limited number of experiments to determine whether type I-like cells transdifferentiated from type II cells grown under A\/L conditions were also susceptible to SARS-CoV. In our previous study (18) , we detected no SARS-CoV infection of human alveolar type I-like cells under submerged conditions, and ACE2 protein expression was below the level of detection. Human alveolar type II cells maintained at an A\/L were well differentiated (Figures 1-3) and permissive for SARS-CoV infection, as shown by immunocytochemistry, by increases in the synthesis of viral RNA and protein, and by the production and release of infectious virions. Hence, the A\/L conditions approximate conditions in vivo. When the alveolar epithelium becomes infected, infected cells alert other cells and organs to the infection by secreting cytokines and chemokines. The next phase of the innate immune response involves the expression of cytokines, which can both attract and activate immune cells and stimulate neighboring cells to amplify the defensive response greatly by secreting additional cytokines and chemokines. He and colleagues suggested that resident ACE2expressing lung epithelial cells, and not the subsequently recruited inflammatory cells, constitute the primary source of elevated cytokines in patients infected with SARS-CoV, and that these epithelial-derived cytokines play an important role in the acute lung injury and pathogenesis of SARS (27) . Similarly, in our type II cells at the A\/L, the level of CXCL10 mRNA expression increased more than 1,000 fold by 24 hours after virus inoculation ( Figure 5 ). We found that rat alveolar type I-like cells infected with rat coronavirus stimulated noninfected cells in the culture to secrete cytokines and chemokines through an IL-1-dependent mechanism (30) . Paracrine signaling by IL-1, which is released from infected type II cells during the activation of the inflammasome, may also play important roles, both in protecting type II cells from infection and in amplifying the innate immune response. Although immunoblotting showed a modest but variable increase in ACE2 expression by type II cells when cultured at the A\/L compared with submerged conditons, we did not detect a consistent increase in the surface expression of ACE2 by either flow cytometry or surface biotinylation (data not shown).

Gene expression profiling provides information on potential modes of action and human relevance, and tools have recently become available for pathway-based quantitative risk assessment. The objective of this study was to use toxicogenomics in the context of human health risk assessment. We explore the utility of toxicogenomics in risk assessment, using published gene expression data from C57BL\/6 mice exposed to 18, 54 and 162 g Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles (CBNP). Analysis of CBNP-perturbed pathways, networks and transcription factors revealed concomitant changes in predicted phenotypes (e.g., pulmonary inflammation and genotoxicity), that correlated with dose and time. Benchmark doses (BMDs) for apical endpoints were comparable to minimum BMDs for relevant pathway-specific expression changes. Comparison to inflammatory lung disease models (i.e., allergic airway inflammation, bacterial infection and tissue injury and fibrosis) and human disease profiles revealed that induced gene expression changes in Printex 90 exposed mice were similar to those typical for pulmonary injury and fibrosis. Very similar fibrotic pathways were perturbed in CBNP-exposed mice and human fibrosis disease models. Our synthesis demonstrates how toxicogenomic profiles may be used in human health risk assessment of nanoparticles and constitutes an important step forward in the ultimate recognition of toxicogenomic endpoints in human health risk. As our knowledge of molecular pathways, dose-response characteristics and relevance to human disease continues to grow, we anticipate that toxicogenomics will become increasingly useful in assessing chemical toxicities and in human health risk assessment.\r\n Crown","text_body":"Chronic inhalation of fine and ultrafine particulate matter has been associated with adverse pulmonary effects including fibrosis and cancer, as well as exacerbation of existing conditions such as asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (Bonner, 2007; Knaapen et al., 2004) , in addition to cardiovascular disease (Dockery et al., 1993; Pope et al., 2004) . Human exposure to manufactured nanomaterials (NMs), which have at least one size dimension that is less than 100 nm, may constitute an increased risk of adverse effects especially following inhalation exposure, and their potential to induce toxic effects is poorly understood (Handy and Shaw, 2007) . Moreover, the human health risks associated with inhalation exposure have not been adequately investigated. Methods that can be effective in screening for NM toxicities are paramount, due to the countless variations in physical and chemical properties of NMs in terms of size, shape, agglomeration and surface coatings.\r\n Traditional assays used in human health risk assessment (HHRA) generally involve chronic and subchronic rodent exposures with concomitant analyses of tumour induction (e.g., two-year rodent cancer bioassay), in addition to various non-cancer endpoints, the most sensitive of which is used for regulatory decision-making (Meek et al., 1994) . These approaches form the foundation of the chemical regulatory system and have been invaluable for HHRA. However, some of these assays, such as those based on chronic animal exposures at the maximum tolerated dose, are time and resource intensive, thus limiting broad application (Suter et al., 2004) . Recent discussions have identified gene expression profiling as a potentially rapid and cost-effective approach for identifying and assessing prospective hazard, characterizing chemical (or particle) mode of action, and assessing human relevance in support of HHRA (National Academy of Sciences, 2007) . In order for gene expression data to become accepted for routine use in HHRA, it is necessary to demonstrate that mRNA\/protein expression profiles can effectively predict the modes of action and biological outcomes of exposure at relevant doses, and to confirm that these data can be used to strengthen the foundation for HHRA and regulatory decisions. In this regard, it has been hypothesized that gene expression profiling will be extremely useful in identifying effects at low doses, and moreover, useful for distinguishing between doses that elicit an adaptive response vs. those that yield adverse effects (Boverhof and Zacharewski, 2006) . To date, the application of gene expression profiling in regulatory toxicology has largely focused on qualitative identification of chemical modes of action and transcription biomarkers that can predict specific toxicities. However, the utility of gene expression profiling in quantitative determination of threshold values (e.g., benchmark doses) has not yet been rigorously explored .\r\n In the present study we investigate the utility of gene expression profiles derived from mice exposed to Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles (CBNPs) by intratracheal installation to identify potential hazards, modes of action, and doses above which adverse effects may be expected for specific toxicological outcomes. In addition, we quantitatively compare benchmark doses for pathways to those of apical endpoints derived from the same experimental animals. We employ Printex 90 as a model NM due to the rich database of traditional toxicity information on which our findings can be anchored. Briefly, Printex 90 consists almost entirely of carbon, with very low levels of impurities in terms of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and endotoxins (Bourdon et al., 2012b; Jacobsen et al., 2008; Saber et al., 2011) They generate reactive oxygen species (Jacobsen et al., 2008) , induce DNA strand breaks in vitro and in vivo (Jacobsen et al., 2009; Saber et al., 2005) and mutations in vitro (Jacobsen et al., 2007) that are associated with oxidative stress . The data in this study are from previously published experiments investigating Printex 90 CBNP exposure in C57BL\/6 mice at various doses (i.e., vehicle, 18, 54 and 162 g) collected at several time-points (1, 3 and 28 days) following a single acute instillation (Bourdon et al., 2012a) . We previously characterized widespread changes in gene expression involving acute phase response and inflammation, supported by concomitant influxes of pulmonary bronchoalveolar lavage cells (BAL) and increases in tissue-specific DNA strand breaks (Bourdon et al., 2012a,b) . In addition to the examination of BMDs and BMDLs, we compare CBNP-modified gene expression profiles to various models of lung disease in mice and humans reported in the literature, in order to explore the utility of our data in predicting the potential risk of adverse health outcomes and the human relevance of expression changes. The work demonstrates one approach by which gene expression profiling may be integrated into HHRA to support or predict apical toxicological endpoints, dose-response, and relevance to human diseases.\r\n Details of the mouse exposures, particle characterization and pulmonary phenotype were previously published in Bourdon et al. (2012a,b) . Briefly, female C57BL\/6 mice were exposed to a single installation of vehicle or Printex 90 (18, 54 or 162 g) and euthanized 1, 3 and 28 days post-exposure (n = 6\/group). The intratracheal instillation route of exposure allows for deposition of known doses directly in the lungs of the mice, and controls for potential dermal-and ingestion-related CBNP exposure that can occur during whole body inhalation exposures. The doses were selected to represent 1, 3 and 9 working days of exposure at the occupational inhalation exposure limit of 3.5 mg\/m 3 of CB (as established by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH))) for a mouse (assuming 1.8 L\/h inhalation rate and 33.8% particle deposition in mouse, for an 8 h working day) (Dybing et al., 1997; Jacobsen et al., 2009) . Very limited filtration of CBNPs from the nose is expected during human exposure. Printex 90 CBNPs were characterized and displayed the following properties: 14 nm primary particle size, 295-338 m 2 \/g Brunauer Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area, 74.2 g\/g PAHs, 142 EU\/g endotoxin, polydispersity index of 1, \u221210.7 mV zeta potential, 2.6 m peak hydrodynamic number and 3.1 m peak volume-size-distribution (Bourdon et al., 2012b) .\r\n Analysis of pulmonary inflammatory cellular influx in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed neutrophilic inflammation that was sustained to day 28 at all doses. Tissue-specific genotoxicity, as observed by DNA strand breaks, persisted up to day 28 at the two highest doses and FPG-sensitive sites at all doses on day 1 and the highest dose on day 3 (Bourdon et al., 2012b) . Whole mouse genome DNA microarray revealed 487 and 81 differentially expressed genes (FDR adjusted pvalue \u2264 0.1 and fold changes \u2265 1.5) overall in lung and liver, respectively (Bourdon et al., 2012a) . The complete microarray dataset is available through the Gene Expression Omnibus at NCBI (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/geo\/, Superseries GSE35284, SubSeries GSE35193). This dataset was previously used to examine molecular interactions between lung and liver upon CBNP exposure (Bourdon et al., 2012a) .\r\n To determine the most affected processes of CBNP exposure, pathway analysis of gene expression data was conducted using a rank based test in R (R Development Core Team, 2011) as described in Alvo et al. (2010) . The relative expression for the genes in a pathway was first aligned by subtracting the median expression value for the combined treatment and control groups. These values were then ranked within each subject and the vector of average ranks was calculated for each treatment group. The distance between the two treatments was calculated and a permutation analysis was used to obtain a p-value for each pathway. Pathways with p < 0.05 were considered significant.\r\n 2.3. Benchmark dose (BMD)\/lower confidence limit benchmark dose (BMDL) calculation for apical endpoints and RT-PCR data BMD10 (BMD representing an excess risk of 10% in exposed animals vs. controls) and BMDLs (95% confidence limit) were calculated for apical endpoint data (inflammation and genotoxicity) and for RT-PCR using EPA BMDS 2.2 (Davis et al., 2011) . Only data that were statistically above control levels (p < 0.05) for at least two of the doses were included. Prior to running the analysis, the data were screened for homogeneity of variance, and then fit against five continuous dose-response models (i.e., hill, polynomial, linear, power and exponential). Goodness of fit >0.05 and scaled residuals within \u00b12.0 was applied as a cut off for selection of the appropriate model, and curves were also inspected visually. When more than one model was suitable, the one with the lowest Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was selected.\r\n In order to determine BMDs and BMDLs for gene expression data, BMDExpress was employed . Briefly, microarray probes with more than one representation on each array were averaged. Analyses were performed on genes that were identified as statistically significant by one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05) using the four following models: Hill, Power, Linear 1 \u2022 and Polynomial 2 \u2022 . The Power model had a power restriction of \u22651. Selection on Linear and Polynomial 2 \u2022 was based on choosing a model which describes the data with the least complexity. A nested Chi-square test, with cut-off of 0.05, first selects among linear and polynomial models, followed by comparing AIC, which measures the relative goodness of fit. A Hill model was excluded if the \"k\" parameter of the model was less than 1\/3 of the lowest positive dose (18 g) (Black et al., 2012) . Other settings included maximum iterations of 250, confidence level of 0.95, benchmark response (BMR) of 1.349 (number of standard deviation defining BMD) . For functional classifications and analyses, the resulting BMD datasets were mapped to KEGG pathways with promiscuous probes removed (probes that mapped to multiple annotated genes). BMDs that exceeded the highest exposure dose (162 g) and that exceeded a goodness-of-fit p-value of 0.1 were removed from the analysis.\r\n To determine the correlation between gene expression profiles of mice exposed to CBNPs with those of mouse pulmonary disease models, a prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM) (Tibshirani et al., 2002) was conducted in R (R Development Core Team, 2011) using the PAMR library (Hastie et al., 2011) . Data for this analysis encompassed 13 mouse lung disease models, and were obtained from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (accession #GSE4231 and #GSE11037). The samples were labelled as belonging to one of three models of lung inflammation: bacterial infection, lung injury and fibrosis, or Th2 response (allergic airway inflammation). Probes with common GENBANK accessions were collapsed to a single measurement for each sample using the mean. Using the common accession numbers, a prediction model using shrunken centroids was estimated. Cross-validation of the nearest shrunken centroid classifier was conducted to identify an appropriate threshold. PAMR implements 10-fold cross-validation. This involves dividing the samples into ten approximately equal-size parts ensuring that the classes are distributed proportionally. Ten-fold cross-validation works by fitting a model on 90% of the samples and then predicting the class labels of the remaining 10%. This procedure is repeated ten times, with each part playing the role of the test samples and the errors on all ten parts added together to compute the overall error. A threshold of 2 was selected, yielding a classifier with 753 GENBANK accessions. The means of the nine CBNP treatment conditions were then classified using the estimated prediction model.\r\n Functional analysis was conducted to establish molecular perturbations that were in common or discrepant between CBNP exposed mice and inflammatory lung disease models. The analysis was conducted on genes that were common between CBNP and each lung disease model, then again for genes that were unique to CBNP, using a cut-off of FDR-adjusted p < 0.1 and a fold-change > 1.5 for all datasets. The less stringent cut-off was employed for disease models because of the low power in several of the datasets. DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 was used to identify enriched biological functions from terms with similar genes and biological meaning (Huang et al., 2009a,b) . DAVID Biological functions with enrichment scores > 1.3 were considered significant, in accordance with DAVID recommendations (Huang et al., 2009a) . Clusters with enrichment scores > 1.3 in our analysis contained at least one gene ontology term or pathway for which the Benjamini-corrected p-value was \u22640.05.\r\n In order to predict potential disease outcomes of relevance to humans, gene expression profiles were mined against genomic data repositories. Disease prediction analysis was done in NextBio (http:\/\/nextbio.com) using the high dose exposure profiles as differentially expressed genes were identified at all time-points for this dose. Data from CBNP exposed mice were compared to curated datasets to identify disease studies with similar gene profiles, gene ranking and consistency. Pairwise gene signature correlations and rank-based enrichment statistics were employed in the calculation of NextBio scores for each disease. The disease that ranked highest in comparison with CBNP exposure was given a score of 100, and the rest of the results were normalized accordingly (Kupershmidt et al., 2010) . Meta-analysis was performed using select disease models for mice, as well as for human studies representative of disease state. The analysis identified, ranked and scored all genes and biogroups that were common between the studies according to the scoring method described above for disease prediction (Kupershmidt et al., 2010) . Biogroups were filtered for canonical pathways.\r\n The rank-based pathway analysis revealed a total of 151, 150 and 106 differentially expressed KEGG pathways on days 1, 3 and 28, respectively. The most affected pathways according to statistical significance were primarily related to inflammation on day 1, to steroid biosynthesis and DNA repair on day 3 and to apoptosis and inflammation on day 28. Significant pathways (p < 0.05) pertaining to genotoxicity (DNA damage and repair) and inflammatory and immune responses are summarized in Table 1 , along with previously established phenotypes. All significant pathways are presented in Supplemental Table 1 . Analysis of the number of common pathways between doses for each time-point revealed that most pathways occurring at lower doses also occur at higher doses. However, the number of significant pathways increased with dose (Fig. 1) .\r\n EPA BMDS 2.2 BMDs and BMDLs were generated for apical endpoints and RT-PCR data (BMD values for each endpoint and gene presented in Supplementary Table 2 ; curves are presented in Supplemental Fig. S1 ). Although many of the apical endpoints and RT-PCR data were not suitable for modelling, BMD and BMDL values generally increased over post-exposure time as expected. The mean BMDs for inflammatory apical endpoints were 0.9, 1.2 and 9.6 g, and BMDLs were 0.6, 0.9 and 6.5 g on days 1, 3 and 28, respectively. BMD values for RT-PCR data of genes involved in inflammation tended to be higher than for apical endpoints. Mean BMDs of inflammatory genes were 14.5, 16.7 and 29.0 g, and mean BMDLs were 10.4, 9.1 and 20.1 g, on days 1, 3 and 28, respectively.\r\n BMDs and BMDLs were also generated for microarray gene expression profiles using BMDExpress. Minimum BMDs for KEGG pathways relevant to inflammation, KEGG pathways relevant to genotoxicity, for the most sensitive KEGG pathways as well as for apical endpoint data are presented in Table 2 . Minimum BMDs were calculated according to the median of all significant genes for each pathway and the 5th percentile of significant genes of all pathways, in order to increase sensitivity. Even the 5th percentile BMDs tended to be higher than BMDs generated for apical endpoints (Table 2) . However, minimum BMDs, representing the most sensitive gene for each relevant pathway, were much more comparable to BMDs of apical endpoints (Table 2) .\r\n PAM was used to compare the Printex 90 gene expression dataset to 13 pulmonary gene expression profiles that represent a range of murine pulmonary disease models (e.g., transgene overexpression, treatments with infectious agents, toxic chemicals and allergens) as described in Lewis et al. (2008) , Thomson et al. (2012) . The models were classified according to the three following subgroups: (1) bacterial infection, (2) lung injury and fibrosis, and (3) Th2 response (allergic airway inflammation).\r\n Clustering of the models using PAM is shown in Fig. 2A . Two CBNP exposure conditions (day 28 low and medium doses) did not cluster with other CBNP exposure condition or other disease models, likely due to lack of response. Models of bacterial infection did not cluster with other disease models or CBNP exposure. PAM analysis revealed an association between CBNP exposure, Th2 responses and lung injury\/fibrotic responses. Although Th2 response and lung injury\/fibrotic responses were more closely associated with one another than with CBNP exposure, PAM analysis revealed that CBNP exposure was more closely related to lung injury\/fibrotic responses than to Th2 responses, which is also supported by probability statistics comparing CBNP exposure with each disease sub-group (Fig. 2B) .\r\n In order to examine commonalities and discrepancies between disease models and CBNP exposure in more detail, functional analysis was conducted on (1) genes that were in common between CBNP and each disease model and (2) genes that were unique to CBNP. The number of significant genes used for each analysis is presented in Supplemental Table 3 . The DAVID biological functions are summarized in Table 3 . This analysis demonstrates that inflammation was common between most models at all time-points (excluding Aspergillus extract). On day 1, commonalities for CBNP exposure were observed with bacterial infection models (i.e., due to the acute phase response) and with injury and fibrosis models (i.e., due to changes in tissue morphogenesis related genes). Day 3 revealed inflammation and cell cycle disturbances in most of the models. However, CBNP responses were more similar to bleomycin-induced lung injury as shown by the high degree of overlapping biological functions on day 3 (Table 3) . CBNPs triggered an adaptive immune response on day 28 that was also only apparent in lung injury and fibrosis models.\r\n Gene expression profiles from the high dose CBNP-exposed mice vs. control were analysed in NextBio to identify closely related respiratory disease profiles in humans. On all post-exposure days, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), congenital cystic Table 1 Summary of significant KEGG pathways (p \u2264 0.05) relating to phenotypes established in Bourdon et al. (2012a,b 1 . Venn diagrams illustrating overlap of significant pathways (p < 0.05) according to dose, for each post-exposure day (1, 3 and 28 days) in C57BL\/6 mice exposed to CBNPs. adenomatoid malformation, and injury of lung, were identified as the top three respiratory diseases associated with CBNP exposure. Interestingly, fibrosis was identified as a predicted disease outcome of CBNP exposure that increased considerably with time (e.g., score of 14 on day 1, 35 on day 3 and 45 on day 28). In order to examine the molecular mechanisms that may be involved in fibrosis in more detail, a meta-analysis was completed using curated studies within NextBio that identified fibrosis as a phenotype. Meta-analysis in mouse employed 36 models that included fibrosis-induced by injury with naphthalene, bleomycin and ganciclovir, doxycyclineinduced over-expression, and TGF-\u2424 over-expression in a variety of mouse models (wild type, inflammation resistant\/susceptible). Meta-analysis using CBNP gene expression profiles in mouse ranked 473 canonical pathways and 21,277 genes present in at least one of the studies on select models of pulmonary fibrosis and lung injury (identified in NextBio disease correlation profiles). In order to establish human-relevance, the analysis was repeated using human studies curated in NextBio. Meta-analysis encompassed 4 studies from lung biopsies of patients affected with fibrosis, with intermediate to severe pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia and exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Overall, 472 canonical pathways and 15,795 genes were ranked as present in at least one of the studies. The top ranked pathways and genes for the mouse and human meta-analyses are presented in Table 4 . Interestingly, comparison of fold-ranks between the mouse and human analysis revealed that the most affected pathways were the same in both species. However, the genes that were most perturbed during fibrotic responses were considerably different in CBNP-exposed mice compared to human diseases, with the exception of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDP1), kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and ceruloplasmin (CP).\r\n It is now widely accepted that toxicity is preceded by, and accompanied by, transcriptional changes, thus providing molecular signatures of direct and indirect toxic effects (Auerbach et al., 2010; Fielden et al., 2011; Gatzidou et al., 2007) . It is hypothesized that toxicogenomic profiling can be used as a screening tool to prioritize the specific assays that should be conducted from the standard battery of tests, thus minimizing animal use, cost and time (Dix et al., 2007) . Moreover, global analyses of transcriptional changes provide a wealth of information that can be used to identify putative modes of action and to query relevance to human adverse health outcomes (Currie, 2012) . This type of approach is the general premise of the widely supported paradigm outlined in 'Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century' (National Academy of Sciences, 2007) . However, substantive work demonstrating the ability of gene expression profiles to identify hazards, to assess risk of exposure via quantitative dose-response analysis, and to identify adverse outcomes associated with specific modes of action is required before these endpoints can be used in HHRA. The present study applies pathway-and network-based approaches, BMD modelling, and disease prediction tools to gene expression data to explore the relationship between apical endpoints and transcriptional profiles. The work investigates the potential utility of gene expression profiling in determining hazard and mode of action of NPs, in characterizing dose-response relationships and in predicting the relevance of these findings to potential disease-outcomes and human health effects for HHRA.\r\n The utility of gene expression profiling in hazard identification has been examined for a limited number of chemicals, including dibutyl phthalate and acetaminophen (Euling et al., 2011; Kienhuis et al., 2011; Makris et al., 2010) . Toxicogenomic profiles of alachlor exposure in rat olfactory mucosa (Genter et al., 2002) and dimethylarsenic (DMA) exposure in human cultured bladder cells and rat bladder epithelium (Sen et al., 2005 ; US EPA, 2005) have also Table 3 Comparison of CBNP profiles with lung disease models using functional analysis for genes in common (grey) and genes unique to CBNP (black). provided useful information for two final assessments of acetochlor and arsenicals (US EPA, 2004 . Our data demonstrate that gene expression profiles can also be viewed as effective predictors of the biological effects of CBNP exposure. For example, inflammatory responses manifested at the gene expression level and detected using DNA microarrays and classified in this work using KEGG pathway analyses and previously in the same mice using ingenuity pathway analysis (Bourdon et al., 2012a) are entirely consistent with the observed pulmonary influx of inflammatory markers (e.g., neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes). The number of genes perturbed and the magnitude of expression changes in these pathways correlates with dose and time. In addition, observed transcriptomic changes associated with perturbations of cell cycle networks, alterations of non-homologous end-joining, and p53 signalling support the sustained genotoxicity observed in the mice, although dose and time correlations were not as apparent (e.g., levels of DNA strand breaks remained relatively constant at the two highest exposure doses (Bourdon et al., 2012b) whereas induction of DNA repair genes decreased with dose and time). The transcriptomic changes associated with alterations in glutathione metabolism and free radical scavenging correlate with induction of DNA formamidopyrimidine DNA glycoslase (FPG) sensitive sites (an indicator of oxidative DNA damage) early after the exposure. The persistence of this response is an indication of an adaptive response to oxidative stress in the lungs of the mice. Interestingly, CBNP-induced alterations in gene expression profiles also revealed a pulmonary acute phase response and unexpected changes in lipid homeostasis, which were subsequently supported by measured decreases in plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) (Bourdon et al., 2012a) . The strong association between CBNPinduced gene expression profiles and apical endpoints collectively support the use of toxicogenomics for hazard identification of Table 4 Meta-analyses in NextBio using mouse and human profiles in which fibrosis was a phenotype. Values in parentheses represent rank in the opposite species (mouse or human).\r\n Rank 1 (rank 2) Pathway Rank 1 (rank 2) Gene (symbol) NMs, and perhaps more importantly, for highlighting unexpected adverse outcomes. Moreover, ongoing work within the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is actively developing adverse outcome pathways (AOP) approaches that are expected to provide tangible methods by which systems biology endpoints can be used in human health risk assessment. Toxicogenomics data that examine responses over dose and time in a variety of tissues can be very useful for such applications, as illustrated for CBNP exposure in Fig. 3 . Overall, our data suggest that gene expression profiles can be effectively used to identify putative mode(s) of action and hazards of NP exposure, in the absence of phenotypic data.\r\n In addition to identification of hazard, it has been suggested that gene expression profiles may be useful for quantitative assessment (e.g., establishment of reference doses) of responses related to both cancer and non-cancer endpoints . Benchmark doses are generally considered more informative than the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) in deriving reference doses as they are based on the entire dose-response relationship (Crump et al., 1995) . Because alterations in gene expression can be initiated in the absence of biological effects (e.g., adaptive or stress response pathways effective in mitigating toxic effects), it is expected that reference doses for genomics endpoints may be too sensitive for use in HHRA. However, previous analyses of 5 chemicals (i.e., 1,4-dichlorobenzene, propylene glycol mono-t-butyl ether, 1,2,3-trichloropropane, methylene chloride and naphthalene) showed that median BMD and BMDLs for the most sensitive pathways and GO categories were highly correlated with BMD and BMDLs of cancer and non-cancer endpoints (Thomas et al., 2011 .\r\n In the current study, rather than choosing the most sensitive (i.e., lowest) BMDs, we focussed on the analysis of pathways that were specific to biological outcomes observed in the mice (i.e., phenotypically anchored), and calculated BMDs for these relevant genes and pathways. The pathway-based BMDs and BMDLs calculated here for relevant pathways were actually less sensitive (i.e., higher BMDs) than those of the observed apical endpoints. However, the mean of the minimum BMDs and BMDLs across all the pathways that we assigned as relevant to the apical endpoints (i.e., corresponding to the most sensitive genes within the relevant pathways) were similar to those of relevant apical endpoints. Median BMDs and BMDLs for the most sensitive pathways also correlate more closely with apical endpoints even though the pathways were not necessarily relevant to these endpoints. This finding supports previous examples demonstrating a 1:1 correlation between BMDs for gene expression and apical endpoints (Thomas et al., 2011 . These data indicate the potential utility of using gene expression profiles in determining acceptable exposure limits for NPs. In order to determine the specific utility of pathway derived BMDs in HHRA, it will be necessary to establish a comprehensive catalogue of pathways that are actually perturbed in the event of specific adverse effects.\r\n Perhaps the principal motivation for including gene expression profiling in HHRA is the wealth of information that can be used to identify key events that are correlated with adverse outcomes that are relevant to human disease, and moreover can be used to predict the likelihood of a human disease. Identification of key events at the transcriptional level can facilitate the identification of processes that are critical for disease initiation and progression, thus allowing information from animal experiments to be queried and used for extrapolation to human scenarios (Edwards and Preston, 2008) . Comparison of our data with specific models of lung disease, including bacterial infection, airway hypersensitivity and lung injury revealed that CBNPs induced responses that were more closely related to lung injury and fibrosis than to other models. This finding was further supported by comparison of the expression profiles of CBNP exposed mice to those of curated studies of animals and humans exhibiting a myriad of pulmonary disease phenotypes. This analysis demonstrates that CBNP exposure perturbs genes that are known to be involved in tissue injury and fibrosis in mice. Although it is unclear if CBNP exposure would result in the same gene expression profile in humans, similar pathways including many involved in fibrotic responses were found in both mice and humans (52% of the top 50 pathways found were common between mouse and human). Despite concordance of pathways, the top ranked genes differed considerably between both species. However, many of the genes found in mice and humans had similar functions, including inflammatory and acute phase responses (e.g., Saa3, Socs3 and Mt2 in mice and CP, VNN2 and CXCL10 in humans), cell cycle progression (Cdkn1a in mice and KLF4 in humans) and bone and tissue modelling (Mmp14, Timp1, Eln and Ogn in mice and SPP1 in humans). Thus, despite discordance in the gene expression profiles between species, the similar functions of top ranked genes and concordance between pathways supports the likelihood of similar responses in the event of CBNP exposure in humans. In addition, fibrosis has been identified as an outcome of exposure to various particles and NPs in animals (Bermudez et al., 2004; Shvedova et al., 2008) , including Printex 90 (e.g., 28-day nose only inhalation in Wistar WU rats) (Bellmann et al., 2009) , as well as in humans (Lkhasuren et al., 2007; Wang and Christiani, 2003) . The process of pulmonary fibrosis is closely related to progression of carcinogenic outcome (Hubbard et al., 2000) . These data demonstrating very similar fibrotic pathways in mice and humans and a significant overlap with CBNP-induced gene expression changes thus support the use of pathway-based approaches in identifying molecular mechanisms of disease onset and progression, and using gene expression profiles to support HHRA.\r\n This study confirms several key elements that are necessary for the application of gene expression profiling for HHRA of toxicant exposures in general. First, transcriptional profiles can effectively predict the biological effects of chemical exposures. Specifically, in the absence of data for any apical endpoints, our data would have suggested that mice exposed to CBNPs exhibit an inflammatory response, oxidative stress, DNA damage and perturbations in cholesterol metabolism. Second, a comparison of BMDs and BMDLs of relevant pathways and apical endpoints confirms that minimum pathway BMDs and BMDLs are in the same range as those of apical endpoints. Third, that expression profiles can be fairly easily mined to identify potential adverse outcomes (i.e., diseases) that are relevant to humans, and might reasonably be expected to occur in humans exposed to substances that elicit specific gene expression patterns in experimental animals. We believe that our work constitutes a significant step towards the ultimate recognition of toxicogenomic endpoints for routine assessment of human health risk.\r\n Gene expression profiling offers a promising approach to decipher the largely unknown hazards of NP exposure. Due to the unique properties of NPs, powerful technologies that can assess a multitude of adverse outcome possibilities will be required to elucidate their modes of action and potential impacts on human health within a time-frame that is suitable for prompt regulatory decision making. This same premise should hold true for any new chemical products, for which toxicity is largely or completely unknown. In order to establish a strong foundation for the integration of gene expression profiling into HHRA, it will be necessary for the approach employed here to be applied to a variety of additional chemicals\/particles that span a wide range of toxicological potencies and modes of action, and using a variety of experimental designs (e.g., multiple doses and time-points). As our knowledge of molecular pathways, and of the diverse tools used to decipher their biological significance, dose-response characteristics and relevance to human disease continues to grow, we anticipate that toxicogenomics will become increasingly useful in assessing the toxicological hazards of a wide range of test articles, and by extension, for HHRA.\r\n Marchetti, Lynn Berndt-Weis and Miriam Hill of Health Canada are thanked for reviewing and commenting on the original manuscript.

These approaches form the foundation of the chemical regulatory system and have been invaluable for HHRA.

The data in this study are from previously published experiments investigating Printex 90 CBNP exposure in C57BL\/6 mice at various doses (i.e., vehicle, 18, 54 and 162 g) collected at several time-points (1, 3 and 28 days) following a single acute instillation (Bourdon et al., Whole mouse genome DNA microarray revealed 487 and 81 differentially expressed genes (FDR adjusted pvalue \u2264 0.1 and fold changes \u2265 1.5) overall in lung and liver, respectively (Bourdon et al., To determine the most affected processes of CBNP exposure, pathway analysis of gene expression data was conducted using a rank based test in R (R Development Core Team, 2011) as described in Alvo et al.

Benchmark dose (BMD)\/lower confidence limit benchmark dose (BMDL) calculation for apical endpoints and RT-PCR data BMD10 (BMD representing an excess risk of 10% in exposed animals vs. controls) and BMDLs (95% confidence limit) were calculated for apical endpoint data (inflammation and genotoxicity) and for RT-PCR using EPA BMDS 2.2 (Davis et al., Goodness of fit >0.05 and scaled residuals within \u00b12.0 was applied as a cut off for selection of the appropriate model, and curves were also inspected visually. The Power model had a power restriction of \u22651. To determine the correlation between gene expression profiles of mice exposed to CBNPs with those of mouse pulmonary disease models, a prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM) (Tibshirani et al., Data for this analysis encompassed 13 mouse lung disease models, and were obtained from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (accession #GSE4231 and #GSE11037). Probes with common GENBANK accessions were collapsed to a single measurement for each sample using the mean. Using the common accession numbers, a prediction model using shrunken centroids was estimated. PAMR implements 10-fold cross-validation. This involves dividing the samples into ten approximately equal-size parts ensuring that the classes are distributed proportionally. In order to predict potential disease outcomes of relevance to humans, gene expression profiles were mined against genomic data repositories. The disease that ranked highest in comparison with CBNP exposure was given a score of 100, and the rest of the results were normalized accordingly (Kupershmidt et al., Meta-analysis was performed using select disease models for mice, as well as for human studies representative of disease state. Biogroups were filtered for canonical pathways. Mean BMDs of inflammatory genes were 14.5, 16.7 and 29.0 g, and mean BMDLs were 10.4, 9.1 and 20.1 g, on days 1, 3 and 28, respectively. BMDs and BMDLs were also generated for microarray gene expression profiles using BMDExpress. However, minimum BMDs, representing the most sensitive gene for each relevant pathway, were much more comparable to BMDs of apical endpoints (Table 2) . Clustering of the models using PAM is shown in Fig. Two CBNP exposure conditions (day 28 low and medium doses) did not cluster with other CBNP exposure condition or other disease models, likely due to lack of response. The number of significant genes used for each analysis is presented in Supplemental Table 3 . The DAVID biological functions are summarized in Table 3 . Day 3 revealed inflammation and cell cycle disturbances in most of the models. CBNPs triggered an adaptive immune response on day 28 that was also only apparent in lung injury and fibrosis models. In order to examine the molecular mechanisms that may be involved in fibrosis in more detail, a meta-analysis was completed using curated studies within NextBio that identified fibrosis as a phenotype. However, the genes that were most perturbed during fibrotic responses were considerably different in CBNP-exposed mice compared to human diseases, with the exception of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDP1), kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and ceruloplasmin (CP). provided useful information for two final assessments of acetochlor and arsenicals (US EPA, 2004 .

Our research has focused on strategies to improve lentiviral gene transfer efficiency in the airways. Previously we demonstrated that a feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-based lentiviral vector pseudotyped with the baculovirus envelope glycoprotein GP64 (GP64-FIV) efficiently transduced mouse nasal epithelia in vivo but transduced mouse intrapulmonary airways with 10-fold less efficiency. Here, we demonstrate that members of a family of proteins with antiviral activity, interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), are more highly expressed in mouse intrapulmonary airways as compared with mouse nasal airways. Using GP64-and VSV-G (vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein)-pseudotyped FIV, we show that expression of mouse IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 restricts gene transfer. Further, we show that both the nasal and intrapulmonary airways of IFITM locus knockout mice are more efficiently transduced with GP64-FIV than their heterozygous littermates. In anticipation of transitioning our studies into pig models of airway disease and clinical trials in humans, we investigated the ability of pig and human IFITMs to restrict lentiviral gene transfer. We observed that both human and pig IFITMs partially restricted both VSV-G-FIV and GP64-FIV transduction in vitro. Previous studies have focused on IFITM-mediated restriction of replication-competent wild-type viruses; however, these results implicate the IFITM proteins as restriction factors that can limit lentivirus-based vector gene transfer to airway epithelia. The findings are relevant to future preclinical and clinical airway gene therapy trials using lentivirus-based vectors.","text_body":"CURRENT LENTIVIRAL VECTOR TECHNOLOGY has progressed considerably toward the goal of creating a vehicle with the ability to efficiently, safely, and persistently express a transgene in the appropriate cell types. 1, 2 Several features of lentiviral vectors make them attractive vehicles for delivering therapeutic genes, including their large transgenepackaging capacity, efficient gene transfer capabilities, persistent expression, the capacity to transduce mitotically quiescent cells, and lack of virus-encoded proteins that could elicit undesirable immune responses. [3] [4] [5] For our studies, we developed gene transfer vectors derived from a nonprimate lentivirus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). 6, 7 Tissue and cellular tropism of lentiviral vectors can be modified by substituting the envelope glycoprotein with other glycoproteins from many different viruses. We previously demonstrated that FIV pseudotyped with the envelope glycoprotein from baculovirus Autographa californica multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrosis virus (GP64) confers apical entry into well-differentiated primary cultures of human, mouse, and pig airway epithelial cells. 4, [8] [9] [10] We further demonstrated that GP64-FIV efficiently transduced the airways of mice or pigs in vivo, was repeatedly administered without the generation of blocking immune responses, and expressed a reporter gene for the life span of mice. 9, 11 Thus, GP64-FIV is a candidate gene therapy reagent for genetic pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis.\r\n Multiple host factors have been identified that limit lentiviral gene transfer efficiency. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] The interferon-induced transmembrane family of proteins (IFITMs) are robustly stimulated by both type I and type II interferons. 17 IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 are all expressed ubiquitously, whereas IFITM5 expression is unique to osteoblasts. 18 Mice and pigs express IFITM orthologs of their human counterparts, and are induced by interferon similarly. 19 The IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 proteins exhibit antiviral activity, including restricting influenza A, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus infection. [20] [21] [22] IFITMs are the only known host restriction factors to block a prefusion step in virus replication. 23 This event occurs in the late endosome or lysosome; however, the exact molecular mechanism of restriction is still unclear. Studies suggest that the prefusion restriction is a result of IFITM presence in the endosomal membrane that renders it unable to achieve the conformational changes in membrane curvature required for hemifusion, an intermediate in the viral envelope fusion process. 23 One report suggests that IFITM proteins will also restrict wild-type, replicationcompetent HIV-1 24 ; in addition, IFITM proteins restrict in vitro entry of VSV G glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped HIV-1-based vectors. [24] [25] [26] We previously reported that GP64-FIV transduces mouse nasal airway epithelia with *10-fold greater efficiency than mouse intrapulmonary epithelia. 10 This difference was not the result of surface area, immune responses, or clearance because the difference was recapitulated in well-differentiated primary cultures derived from mouse septa and trachea. In addition, the transduction efficiency difference was also observed with VSV-G-and Ebola-pseudotyped FIV. 10 These data suggested that a cellular restriction factor was responsible for the difference in transduction efficiency. Here, we investigate whether the IFITM family of proteins contributes to the differential transduction efficiency observed between the nasal and tracheal airways.\r\n Lentiviral vectors were produced and titered by the University of Iowa Viral Vector Core (Iowa City, IA; www.medicine.uiowa.edu\/vectorcore). The FIV vector system used in this study 27, 28 expressed firefly luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the FIV3.3RSV backbone. 29 VSV-G, Machupo virus (MACV), and baculovirus (GP64)-pseudotyped FIV vector particles were generated by transient transfection, concentrated 250-fold by centrifugation, and titered using real-time PCR as previously described. 29 \r\n The T-REx system (K1030-01; Invitrogen\/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to generate doxycycline-inducible stable cell lines expressing IFITMs, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, T-REx HeLa cells (R714-07; Invitrogen\/Thermo Fisher Scientific) that stably express the Tet repressor were transfected with pcDNA4\/TO\/myc-His (V1030-20; Invitrogen\/Thermo Fisher Scientific) plasmids encoding individual IFITM genes. These transfected cells were then selected in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) supplemented with blasticidin at 5 lg\/ml (R210-01; Invitrogen\/Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Zeocin at 50 lg\/ml (R250-01; Invitrogen\/Thermo Fisher Scientific). Monoclonal cell lines were isolated by means of cloning cylinders (CLS31668; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and expanded. To verify IFITM expression, cells were treated with doxycycline (1 lg\/ml) for 24 hr, cell lysates were collected, and Western blots were performed using standard techniques. Briefly, total protein was sonicated, loaded onto 15% Tris-HCl gels (4569035; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and run at 100 V in Tristricine\/SDS buffer (1610734; Bio-Rad) diluted to 1\u00b7. Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (1620177; Bio-Rad) at 0.3 A for 90 min at 4\u00b0C in Tris-glycine transfer buffer (LC3675; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Membranes were blocked overnight in 5% milk and incubated with mouse monoclonal primary antibody against C9 tag (diluted 1:1000) (ab5417; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or c-Myc tag (diluted 1:1000) (R950-25; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 3 hr at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were washed and then incubated for 45 min at room temperature with a goat antimouse secondary antibody (diluted 1:5000) (31437; Thermo Fisher Scientific) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Membranes were then developed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (34080; Thermo Fisher Scientific).\r\n Restriction assays were performed in 24-well plates coated with poly-L-lysine (P4707; Sigma-Aldrich). For each vector pseudotype and vector production lot, a vector dilution was chosen that conferred *20% GFP + cells in the T-REx parental cell line. The T-REx stable cell lines were maintained in EMEM (11965-084; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10082139; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were treated with either doxycycline (1 lg\/ml) or vehicle (buffered culture medium) for 24 hr before transduction with FIV expressing GFP. Cells were incubated with viral vectors for 4 hr in serum-free medium. After the transduction period, the serum-free transfection medium was replaced with maintenance medium. Forty-eight hours after transduction, cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde, harvested, and suspended, using Accumax proteolytic cell detachment solution (SCR006; Millipore, Billerica, MA), and GFP expression was quantified with a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).\r\n IFITMdel +\/mice were kindly provided by M. Farzan. 21 Because of the inclusion of tyrosinase marker Tyr at the telometric end of the deletion, the genotype segregates exclusively with coat color. Wild-type littermates are albino, hemizygous littermates are light tan, and knockout mice are light brown. 30 All genotypes were verified by PCR of genomic DNA. This study was approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Approximately 1 \u00b7 10 7 transducing units (TU) of FIV vector formulated with 1% methylcellulose (1:1) in a total volume of 50 ll was delivered to the nasal epithelia via direct instillation, or to the trachea epithelia via a 24gauge Teflon catheter. Methylcellulose increases viral vector gene transfer efficiency in nasal and intrapulmonary airways without disrupting transepithelial resistance. 4\r\n Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 ll of D-luciferin (15 mg\/ml in 1\u00b7 phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]; Xenogen, Alameda, CA), using a 25gauge needle. After 5 min, mice were imaged with the Xenogen IVIS charge-coupled device camera while under 1-3% isoflurane anesthetization. Imaging data were analyzed and signal intensity was quantified with Xenogen Living Image software. The negative controls in all in vivo bioluminescence assays were naive strain matched mice. We included negative controls in every assay and report only background-subtracted levels of experimental groups.\r\n For each species (mouse, pig, and human) the IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 expression vectors were generated for overexpression studies. Human Fisher Scientific). The murine Ifitm sequences were subsequently cloned into a pcDNA4.0 backbone. Sequences were verified with published Ifitm cDNA sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, Bethesda, MD). The mouse and pig sequences were cloned with an N-terminal nine-amino acid epitope from bovine rhodopsin (the C9 epitope) for detection via immunocytochemistry. Notably, we report here a pig IFITM1 sequence (KT873487) containing a single-nucleotide difference (alanine to guanine) from the NCBI sequence ( JQ315414) that results in a histidine-to-glutamine change at amino acid position 113. In addition, our sequencing of pig IFITM3 (KT873488) differed from the NCBI sequence (NM_001201382) by two nucleotides: a synonymous thymine-to-cytosine change at nucleotide position 57 and a thymine-to-cytosine change resulting in an isoleucine-to-threonine change at amino acid position 117. These sequences were confirmed in cDNA isolated from eight pigs of similar breeds.\r\n Total cellular RNA was harvested from eight donor cultures of both nasal turbinate and tracheal cells using TRIzol-chloroform extraction. Reverse transcriptase PCR was performed with a high-capacity reverse transcriptase kit (4368813; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primers were designed with software available through the IDT website, and primers were subsequently ordered from IDT. Primer sequences were as follows: pig IFITM1 forward 5\u00a2-CTT TCG CCT ACT CCG TGA AG-3\u00a2, reverse 5\u00a2-AGA TGT TCA GGC ACT TGG C-3\u00a2; pig IFITM2 forward 5\u00a2-CTG AAC ATC TGGGCT CTG ATC-3\u00a2, reverse 5\u00a2GCT CTA ACA TCT GGT AGG CTG-3\u00a2; pig IFITM3 forward 5\u00a2-CTG AAC ATC TGG GCT CTG-3\u00a2, reverse 5\u00a2-AAA TTA CCA GGG AGC CAG TG-3\u00a2. Real-time quantitative PCR used SYBR green and was performed on a 7900HT fast realtime PCR machine (Applied Biosystems\/Thermo Fisher Scientific), and analysis was performed with Applied Biosystems SDS 2.3 software, using the 2DC t analysis method to determine fold change relative to nasal turbinate.\r\n All numerical data are presented as meansstandard error. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Two-tailed, unpaired Student t tests were used to compare the experimental treatment group with the no-doxycycline control for the majority of the studies reported here. F tests were performed in parallel to determine that variance was similar between groups. For nonparametric data, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. To generate the error bars for the control samples, we first calculated the standard error for the raw data. The normalized error bars are calculated on the basis of the ratio to the mean expression, using the formula: standard error\/mean expression \u00b7 normalized expression = normalized standard error.\r\n In a previous study, we observed that GP64-FIV transduced mouse nasal airways with greater efficiency than the intrapulmonary airways. 10 This observation was true both in vivo and in welldifferentiated primary cultures derived from mouse nasal septa or trachea. We hypothesized that the differential expression pattern was due to a cellspecific factor. Using real-time PCR we assessed the mRNA transcript abundance of seven previously described lentiviral restriction factors [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] 22 from mouse nasal septa-or trachea-derived tissues. We observed no differences in the expression levels of CPSF6, SAMHD1, APOBEC3, or TRIM28. However, the basal mRNA expression levels of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 were all elevated in mouse tracheal tissue as compared with the nasal septa (Fig. 1) . Zfhx4 expression is specific to nasal tissues and was used as a control. Glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is expressed at similar levels in both nasal septa and trachea and was used as a control. On the basis of these data, the IFITM family members were identified as proteins of interest for further study.\r\n To investigate the role of the IFITM proteins in restricting GP64-FIV entry, we used IFITM overexpression assays. Doxycycline-inducible stable lines expressing C9-tagged mouse IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 were established. As demonstrated by Western blot, the levels of IFITM were detectable only in the presence of doxycycline ( Fig. 2A) . For the restriction assay, cells were treated with doxycycline or vehicle for 24 hr. The cells were then transduced with FIV expressing GFP and pseudotyped with VSV-G, GP64, or Machupo virus (MACV) envelope glycoprotein. MACV is a New World arenavirus that is reported not to be subject to IFITM restriction 22 and serves as a negative control. The native VSV ''G'' envelope glycoprotein has reproducibly been shown to be restricted 22 and thus serves as a positive control. The cells were transduced at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) sufficient to result in *20% positive cells in the vehicle-treated groups. Three days after vector transduction, the percentage of GFP-positive cells was quantified by flow cytometry. In the presence of doxycycline, we observed that VSV-G-FIV was re- stricted by mIFITM1 (Fig. 2B), mIFITM2 (Fig. 2C) , and mIFITM3 (Fig. 2D) . No significant restriction was observed for MACV-FIV. Similar to VSV-G-FIV, GP64-FIV was also restricted by each of the IFITM family members tested. These results were the first indication that IFITM family members restrict viral vector pseudotyped with baculovirus GP64 and may help to explain why GP64-FIV transduces mouse nasal epithelia with greater efficacy than mouse intrapulmonary airways.\r\n We used quantitative real-time RT-PCR to measure Ifitm mRNA expression in the stable cell lines (+Dox) and endogenous Ifitm mRNA baseline expression in mouse trachea (data not shown). These levels were normalized to the reference gene encoding hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT or Hprt, respectively). In all cases, Ifitm1, Ifitm2, and Ifitm3 levels were *2-to 4-fold higher than that of the reference gene, suggesting that Ifitm is expressed (at least at the mRNA level) at similar levels in our stimulated stable cell lines in vitro and in mouse trachea in vivo.\r\n To determine whether IFITMs contribute to vector restriction in mouse airways in vivo, we delivered GP64-FIV expressing firefly luciferase to Ifitm locus knockout (-\/-) mice, hemizygous (+\/-) littermates, or wild-type (+\/+) littermates. The knockout mice, termed IfitmDel, were first described by Lange and colleagues. 30 These mice lack Ifitm1, Ifitm2, Ifitm3, Ifitm5, and Ifitm6 genes. We observed significantly increased levels of gene transfer in both the nose and lung of knockout mice (Fig. 3) . Because basal IFITM expression is higher in the intrapulmonary airways than in the nasal airways (Fig. 1) , we hypothesized that in Ifitm locus knockout mice the level of transgene expression in the intrapulmonary airways would equilibrate to the levels of expression in the nasal airways. However, we observed that nasal luciferase expression after GP64-FIV transduction in knockout mice was enhanced to a greater extent than was observed in the lung. In addition, gene transfer to the lung of knockout mice was similar to gene transfer to the nose of hemizygous littermates. These data suggest that one or more of the IFITM family members are restriction factors to lentiviral gene transfer in both the nasal and intrapulmonary airways of mice. They may contribute to the differential transduction pattern observed between the lung and nose, but other variables are involved. \r\n The airways of humans and pigs share many anatomical similarities; therefore, pigs are becoming a common preclinical model of gene therapy for pulmonary disease. For this reason, we turned our attention to human and pig IFITMs. IFITM protein alignments are shown in Fig. 4 . Of note, pig and human IFITMs share the greatest homology, ranging in protein similarity from 73 to 81%. Pig versus mouse and human versus mouse protein similarities ranged from 64 to 77%. We note that the greatest sequence homology exists in the regions that cover the two putative transmembrane domains in the predicted membrane topology of the IFITM protein (Fig. 4) . The similarity supports the importance of the IFITM transmembrane domains in restricting host-virus fusion.\r\n Using real-time PCR and RNA isolated from welldifferentiated primary epithelial cultures from porcine nasal turbinate and trachea, we measured pig IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 expression levels. Unlike in mice, the expression levels in pigs were not different between the two tissue types (Fig. 5) . These results were consistent with microarray results comparing pig turbinate and tracheal epithelia. On the basis of the microarray results, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 were equally expressed; furthermore, no differences were observed in other putative restriction factors such as tetherin, MOV10, or TRIM5a (data not shown). These data suggest that the differential expression pattern of IFITM family members may be species specific.\r\n To determine whether human and pig IFITMs also restrict lentiviral vector transduction, we generated six additional doxycycline-inducible stable cell lines. Approximately 60 total monoclonal cell lines were screened for doxycycline-inducible IFITM expression by Western blot, and those cell lines with similar levels of expression were chosen for restriction assays (data not shown). Restriction assays were repeated in the human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 and pig IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 cell lines. We observed that overexpressing IFITMs from pig (Fig. 6A) and human (Fig. 6B ) significantly restricted GP64-FIV. VSVG-FIV was also significantly restricted by each IFITM. Conversely, MACV-FIV was not significantly restricted by any of the IFITMs. \r\n These studies began with the following question: Are IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 responsible for the less efficient lentiviral vector transduction in mouse intrapulmonary airways as compared with mouse nasal airway epithelia? We observed that the IFITM proteins restrict GP64-FIV transduction of stable cell lines. In addition, Ifitm locus knockout mice were more permissive to GP64-FIV transduction than were hemizygous littermates. These results suggest IFITMs may contribute to the differential transduction of mouse nasal and lung airways. However, a greater increase in luciferase expression was observed in mouse nasal airways despite higher basal levels of Ifitm1, Ifitm2, or Ifitm3. Thus, addional factors must play a role.\r\n Interestingly, we previously reported that lentivirus-mediated gene transfer to the nose and lung of interferon receptor a\/b knockout mice was indistinguishable from that to strain-matched wild-type mice. 10 Because IFITMs are induced by interferons, similar results might be expected between the IFITM knockout mice used in this study and the previously reported interferon receptor knockout mice. However, the mice used in the previous study were deficient only in type I interferon signaling and retained functional type II (IFN-c) and type III (IFN-k) interferon signaling. All three signaling pathways are thought to induce IFITM expression. 17 These redundancies may explain why the interferon receptor a\/b knockout mice were phenotypically identical to wild-type mice in terms of lentiviral gene transfer properties.\r\n We next asked whether IFITM-mediated restriction of lentiviral gene transfer is species specific, and chose to compare pig and human IFITMs. This question is relevant to our goal of engineering a suitable gene transfer vector as a potential therapy for pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Importantly, pig models of cystic fibrosis manifest airway disease phenotypes present in humans with cystic fibrosis. 31, 32 Advantages of the pig as a model include lung anatomy, physiology, histology, and biochemistry that are more similar to humans. 33 In addition, pigs share greater DNA sequence homology with humans than do mice, have a larger body size, and longer life spans. Similar to the mouse, we observed that pig and human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 all restrict GP64-FIV transduction in vitro. However, unlike in mice, there was no difference in basal expression of IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 in tracheal and nasal airway epithelial cells. This is consistent with our previous observation that GP64-FIV transduces pig nasal and tracheal epithelial cells with equal efficiency. 10 We conclude that IFITMs partially restrict transduction of lentivirus-based vectors in both pig and human airway cells. We note that mouse, pig, and human IFITMs also restricted VSV-G-pseudotyped FIV, an envelope that The procedure was repeated for cells stably expressing Myc-tagged human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3. n = 11; *p < 0.001, **p < 0.00001. is widely used in gene transfer applications. 5, 34 Because it is known that IFITMs restrict entry of other enveloped viruses, including influenza, Ebola, and others, 20-22 our findings likely have broad relevance.\r\n Previous studies investigating IFITM-mediated restriction have focused on replication-competent enveloped viruses. [20] [21] [22] [23] Traditionally, this class of restriction factor likely has evolved to prevent secondary rounds of viral spread. Gene expression is induced after the initial viral infection stimulates an interferon response. However, in this study we investigated the effect on replicationincompetent lentivirus-based vector. In this setting, it is likely that the basal levels of IFITM protein have one chance to prevent the trafficking and fusion steps necessary for endosomal fusion and entry. The overexpression of the IFITMs in the inducible cell lines may represent the ''worst case scenario'' for viral vector transduction. However, significantly greater levels of transduction were observed in IFITM locus knockout mice, indicating that even basal IFITM expression significantly alters transduction efficiency.\r\n Given the sequence conservation between species, the observation that all IFITMs restricted vector entry similarly is perhaps not unexpected. In addition, neither IFITM1, IFITM2, nor IFITM3 was consistently most restrictive among the three species tested. We note that we first performed these studies using transient transfection of the IFITMs followed by vector delivery (data not shown). In those studies, results varied greatly from experiment to experiment. The generation of stable cell lines with inducible expression was necessary to achieve reproducible results.\r\n Given the observed finding of IFITM-mediated restriction to lentiviral gene transfer, investigating potential methods to transiently knock down or inhibit IFITM function in airway epithelial cells could provide a means for temporarily improving viral vector-mediated gene transfer. In fact, studies suggest that amphotericin B may provide such a reagent. 35, 36 Using technologies such as the Connectivity Map, 37 gene expression profiles from cells with and without IFITM expression could be used as queries to identify candidate drugs for screening in future work. Transient knockdown of IFITMs, using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technologies, is a less appealing strategy because of the resulting interferon stimulation that simultaneously augments antiviral defenses, including IFITMs.\r\n In conclusion, our results identify the IFITM family of proteins as novel barriers to GP64mediated lentiviral gene transfer. These results are consistent across species and have potential therapeutic implications for improving gene delivery to correct genetic diseases affecting the airway epithelium.","sha":"24f2a783783392de3881e1146c81babb826703c8","publish_time":"2016-05-01","authors":"Hornick, Andrew L.; Li, Ni; Oakland, Mayumi; McCray, Paul B.; Sinn, Patrick L.","journal":"Human Gene Therapy","doi":"10.1089\/hum.2015.156","Title":"Human Gene Therapy","H index":142.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"CURRENT LENTIVIRAL VECTOR TECHNOLOGY has progressed considerably toward the goal of creating a vehicle with the ability to efficiently, safely, and persistently express a transgene in the appropriate cell types. 4, [8] [9] [10] We further demonstrated that GP64-FIV efficiently transduced the airways of mice or pigs in vivo, was repeatedly administered without the generation of blocking immune responses, and expressed a reporter gene for the life span of mice. 20] [21] [22] IFITMs are the only known host restriction factors to block a prefusion step in virus replication. 29 VSV-G, Machupo virus (MACV), and baculovirus (GP64)-pseudotyped FIV vector particles were generated by transient transfection, concentrated 250-fold by centrifugation, and titered using real-time PCR as previously described.

These findings demonstrate that PLGA-PEI nanoparticles are a potential new delivery system to carry genes to the lung epithelium. q","text_body":"Pulmonary gene delivery and DNA vaccination are of considerable interest due to the variety of lung diseases that can be addressed by this approach. Diseases like cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and more could be treated by high-level and long-term expression of the corresponding gene of interest [1 -5] . Furthermore, many pathogens that enter the body through the airways, causing pulmonary as well as systemic diseases like Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza and SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS -CoV) could be controlled once appropriate vaccination strategies would be applied [6 -9] . Pulmonary vaccination against air-borne pathogens holds the promise of inducing both systemic and local immune responses, resulting in the induction of IgA mucosal antibodies that can prevent the pathogen's entry at the level of the mucosal surface [10, 11] .\r\n Gene delivery in humans requires carriers that will transfer DNA into the nuclei of target cells. These carriers must be efficient in transfection, safe for human use, protect the DNA from degradation before arriving at the target cell and possibly hold targeting qualities for the specific delivery of the gene to the required cells or tissue. The two approaches for gene delivery are viral and non-viral systems. Although very efficient in transfection, viral gene delivery systems still face safety issues for human use and due to their inherent immunogenicity, are problematic when repeated doses with the same carrier are required. Non-viral delivery systems are generally synthetic agents that are much safer, however, their transfection efficiency in-vivo is limited [12, 13] .\r\n Much attention was given to the biodegradable and biocompatible poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymers. These polymers were extensively evaluated for their ability to deliver a variety of therapeutic agents by targeted and\/or sustained delivery, were tested for toxicity and safety in animal models and are currently used in humans for resorbable sutures, bone implants and scaffolds in tissue engineering [14 -16] . PLGA nanoparticles were shown to escape from the endo-lysosomal compartment to the cytoplasmic compartment and release their contents over extended periods of time [17, 18] . These properties rendered PLGA nanoparticles as potential efficient [19, 20] . In cases where adsorption of DNA on the surface was desired, positively charged agents like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were used to produce PLG particles that are positively charged at physiological pH. These particles were able to induce higher antibody and cytotoxic immune responses to HIV-1 pCMV p55 gag plasmid in vivo [21 -23] .\r\n In order to achieve efficient pulmonary gene expression, the addition of the cationic polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEI), to the PLGA nanoparticles was explored. PEIs exhibit a high positive charge density when protonated in aqueous solutions and are considered to be promising candidates as non-viral vectors for delivery of DNA and oligonucleotides, for in-vitro and in-vivo applications [24, 25] . Branched PEI was reported to be associated with successful pulmonary gene delivery, initiated in-vivo transfection and induced only low levels of cytokine production in the lungs [26 -29] .\r\n In this study, new PLGA particles with PEI attached to their surface were prepared and characterized with regard to size, zeta-potential and loading efficiency. The intracellular pathway of these particles was evaluated together with their cytotoxicity in the human bronchial cell line Calu-3 in order to assess their potential in serving as pulmonary gene delivery system.\r\n D, L-Lactide\/Glycolide copolymer (PLGA, PURA-SORB w , DL663FL, molar ratio: 53\/47, inherent viscosity 0.69 dl\/g) was a generous gift from PURAC (Gorinchem, The Netherlands). Twenty-five kD branched water-free polyethyleneimine (PEI), Tween-80 w , N-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-N 0 -(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES), penicillin and streptomycin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). Poloxamer 188 (Lutrol F68) was purchased from BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany). Acetone of analytical grade was from Fisher chemicals (Leicestershire, UK) and dichloromethane of analytical grade from Biosolve BV (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). Ninety-six flat buttom well-plates and 12wells Transwells w were obtained from Corning (Schiphol, The Netherlands). Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) were purchased from Gibco (Basel, Switzerland).\r\n The preparation method of PLGA -PEI nanoparticles was a modification of the technique described by Wehrle et al. [30] . A solution of 10% (w\/v) PLGA in Dichloromethane was stirred for 30 min. PEI solution in acetone was prepared to a final concentration of 1% (w\/v). PEI was added to the PLGA solution according to the requested PLGA -PEI ratio (we investigated PLGA -PEI w\/w ratios of 25:1 and 10:1), Tween-80 w added to a final concentration of 1% (w\/v) and acetone added up to 10 ml. This organic phase was mixed and poured into an aqueous phase of 20 ml of 0.5% (w\/v) Poloxamer-188 in milli-Q w , under moderate stirring at room temperature. Since the acetone diffused into the aqueous phase rapidly, particles formation was observed immediately by the milky color of the aqueous phase. The dichloromethane was rotor evaporated under reduced pressure and then the suspension was filtered through 4-7 mm retention size paper filter (595 1 2 ) folded filters, Schleicher and Schuell, s'Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands) to remove large polymer particles. This suspension was then used for the loading of DNA.\r\n PLGA -PEI nanoparticles were loaded withV1Jns DNA plasmid or V1Jns encoding Antigen 85B of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (a gift from the Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center) as a model for tuberculosis DNA vaccine in the characterization studies. PLGA -PEI nanoparticles suspension was added to a solution of 25 mg\/ml DNA plasmid and vortexed for 30 s. The amount of PLGA -PEI nanoparticles suspension added changed according to the PEI -DNA ratio requested (ranging from 0.5:1 up to 5:1). Formulations were left at room temperature for at least 1 h before use.\r\n Particle size and zeta potential measurements were performed using Zetasizer w 3000 HSA (Malvern Instruments, Bergen op Zoom, The Netherlands). Particle size was measured by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) at 25 8C and a fixed 908 scattering angle. Zeta potential determinations were based on electrophoretic mobility of the nanoparticles in the aqueous medium.\r\n Polycarbonate membrane filters (Nucleopore w , 13 mm filters, 0.1 mm pore size; Whatman, Kent, UK) were placed on a humidified paper filter. Samples were applied on the filters and left to dry overnight at room temperature. The loaded filters were coated with gold to a thickness of 6 nm using Emitech K650X large sample coater (Emitech, Kent, UK). Samples were visualized using Jeol JSM-6700F field emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL BV, Schiphol-Rijk, The Netherlands).\r\n The amount of encapsulated DNA in the nanoparticles was calculated by measuring the difference between the amount of DNA added to the nanoparticles solution and the measured non-entrapped DNA remaining in the aqueous phase after nanoparticle formation. After formation, the nanoparticle suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm and the supernatant was checked for the nonbound DNA concentration with PicoGreen w ds DNA quantitation assay (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) using a Perkin Elmer 7000 Fluorescence Bio assay reader.\r\n Calu-3 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 50 mg\/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 8C in an incubator with 90% humidity and 5% CO 2 . A week later, cells were trypsinized and seeded in 4 \u00a3 10 5 cells\/ml seeding density in 12-well Transwells w for intracellular staining experiments or in 96-well plates for cytotoxicity studies. Experiments were performed with cells of passage numbers 38-48.\r\n For the intracellular localization studies, the procedure of Denis-Mize et al. [22] was used with slight modifications. To evaluate the internalization of the DNA loaded PLGA -PEI nanoparticles and their intracellular localization we used the air-interface culture conditions for Calu-3 cells where the apical culture medium is removed after 1 day of culture. Seven days after seeding, rhodamine-labeled plasmid DNA with hCMV IE promoter\/enhancer driving green fluorescent protein gene (pGeneGripe Rhodamine\/GFP, Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA, USA) bound to PLGA -PEI nanoparticles suspended in HBSS -HEPES, pH 7.4 was added to the wells at 1 mg DNA\/well (PLGA -PEI ratio of 10:1; PEI -DNA ratio of 2:1). Cells were incubated with formulations for 4 h and then washed twice and the incubation continued at air-interface. For the co-localization studies, cells were washed, fixated and permeabilized using the Cytofix\/Cytoperm e kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium) and stained with mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody for the lysosomal associated membrane protein, LAMP-1 (clone H4A3, BD Pharmingen, Erembodegem, Belgium) followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor w 633 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Cells were washed, applied to glass microscope slides and visualized using Bio-Rad 2100MP (multi-photon) confocal microscope (equipped with Argon 488 nm, HeliumNeon 543 nm and Red diode 637 nm lasers; Veenendaal, The Netherlands) with inverted TE 2000U Nikon microscope (Uvikon, Bunnik, The Netherlands). To detect GFP protein expression 48 h after the formulations were applied, the filters were cut out of the Transwell w insert, placed on a glass slide, covered with cover glass and immediately visualized under the confocal microscope.\r\n Two days after cells were seeded into the 96 well plates, cells were washed and formulations in HBSS -HEPES, pH 7.4 were applied on cells at a concentration of 1 mg DNA\/well. Cell culture medium was used as a positive control and 0.1 mg\/ml NaOH\/10 mg\/ml SDS solution as negative control for cell viability. After 4 h, cells were washed twice and CellTiter 96 w aqueous one solution cell proliferation assay (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a BioTek EL \u00a3 808 microplate reader (Winooski, Vt, USA).\r\n The particle size of the nanoparticles was between 207 and 231 nm for all PLGA -PEI ratios and PEI -DNA ratios examined ( Table 1 ). The size measurements revealed a polydispersity index lower than 0.2, indicating narrow particle size distributions. The stable particle size and the narrow distribution suggest that the preparation technique is reproducible and results in the formation of uniform particles at both PLGA -PEI ratios. DNA loading did not change particle size for PEI -DNA ratios between 5:1 and 0.5:1. Although particles in the micrometer size range have better lung deposition than nanoparticles [31] , it was shown that nanoparticles have relatively higher intracellular uptake compared to microparticles and that in some cell-lines, only nanoparticles were taken up efficiently [14, 32] . The stable nano-size of these particles makes them suitable for uptake by pulmonary epithelial cells and APCs, which is the first step for gene delivery. The zeta potential of PEI -DNA ratio of 5:1 was 52.3 and 53.5 mV for PLGA -PEI ratios 25:1 and 10:1, respectively, while PEI -DNA ratio of 0.5:1 resulted in lower zeta potential values of 36.0 and 32.1 mV (Table 1) .\r\n These results indicate that the zeta potential was not affected by the PLGA -PEI ratio; however, it was influenced by the PEI -DNA ratio. The positive surface charge of the particles is a result of the orientation of PEI on the surface, since PLGA particles have a negative surface charge. The positively charged particle surface can facilitate adherence to negatively charged cellular membranes, inducing and increasing intracellular uptake. SEM micrographs showed round particles, with a size distribution confirming the size measurements by PCS and particle morphology independent of PLGA -PEI ratio and PEI -DNA ratio (Fig. 1) .\r\n Loading efficiency of the PLGA -PEI nanoparticles was above 99% for all PLGA -PEI ratios and PEI -DNA ratios tested (Table 2 ). Since our initial loading dose was 5 mg, the accuracy of this assay was high, considering 0.1% of the loading dose is still above the detection limit of the PicoGreen assay. This high and reproducible loading efficiency correlates with efficient surface adsorption that prevents material loss and suggests that even in the PEI -DNA ratio of 0.5:1, there is excess of nitrogen groups from the PEI over the phosphate groups of the DNA. Gautam et al. calculated that a 10:1 N\/P ratio corresponds to 1.29:1 PEI -DNA weight ratio using the 25 kDa PEI [26] , confirming that at 0.5:1 weight ratio there are still more nitrogen groups present than phosphate. Since we assume the PEI is physically attached to the nanoparticles surface, the exact number of nitrogen groups on the particle surface should be further evaluated in order to determine the exact N\/P ratio.\r\n The intracellular distribution of the rhodamine-labeled DNA adsorbed to PLGA -PEI nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 2 . The late endosomal distribution is visualized by immunostaining for LAMP-1 protein with an Alexaconjugated secondary antibody (a). It was shown that after 6 h, the rhodamine-labeled DNA (b) is co-localized with the lysosomal signal (c). These results show that the particles were taken up by the lung epithelial cells and the DNA was located in the endo-lysosomal compartment. The culture conditions in the case of Calu-3 cells are of extreme importance since culture at air-interface (removal of apical culture medium one day after seeding) resulted in a morphology more representative of the in vivo situation in comparison to culture under submerged conditions (presence of culture medium on both sides of the cell monolayer) [33, 34] . The fact that the nanoparticles were internalized and the DNA was transferred to the endolysosomal compartment despite the presence of cilia and mucus suggested that these particles were suitable to deliver DNA across mucosal surfaces of the lung. GFP protein expression was detected in Calu-3 cells, however, the signal was rather low. The fact that protein was detected suggested that a certain percentage of the particles could escape the endo-lysosomal compartment and DNA was able to enter the nucleus. Since the DNA is directly attached to the PEI on the particles surface and the PEI is more exposed to interaction with the endo-lysosomal membrane than the PLGA, we assume that the endo-lysosmal escape is governed by intrinsic characteristics of PEI. PEI is one of a few polycations that has a high transfection potential due to its intrinsic endosomolytic activity caused by high buffer capacity at virtually any pH. Upon acidification of the endolysosome, PEI causes osmotic swelling and subsequent endosomal rupture followed by the escape of PEI\/DNA complexes into the cytosol [13, 25] . Since PLGA -PEI nanoparticles delivered the DNA into the cells, escaped the endo-lysosmal compartment and resulted in protein expression, they should be regarded as a new promising DNA carrier for pulmonary delivery. This study evaluated qualitatively the intracellular pathway of the DNA loaded PLGA -PEI nanoparticles, however, quantitative analysis of protein expression in cell culture and using in-vivo models will be further investigated.\r\n In PEI -DNA ratio of 2:1, cell viability was measured to be 56.5%^4.8% and 61.5%^10.9% for PLGA -PEI ratios 25:1 and 10:1, respectively (Fig. 3) . When the PEI -DNA ratio decreased, cell viability increased above 94% for the 1:1 ratio and full recovery was seen at the 0.5:1 ratio. This suggests that cell toxicity was independent on the PLGA -PEI ratio, but was markedly affected by the PEI -DNA ratio. Since an equal amount of DNA was given to all groups, the difference in cell viability reflected the amount of PLGA and PEI delivered. It was previously reported that PLGA particles did not significantly affect the viability of macrophages and DCs, even when loaded with a large number of microspheres and successive microsphere decay where acidic degradation products are formed [20] . However, it was shown in Calu-3 cells that higher PEI -DNA ratio correlates with higher cytotoxicity [35] . The results we present here show that cell toxicity can be reduced by using lower PEI -DNA ratio that will bear the same characteristics and loading efficiency as the higher PEI -DNA ratios. The non-toxic formulations will be further evaluated for their in-vitro and in-vivo ability to serve as DNA carriers for the purposes of gene therapy and vaccination.

The two approaches for gene delivery are viral and non-viral systems. Much attention was given to the biodegradable and biocompatible poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymers. These polymers were extensively evaluated for their ability to deliver a variety of therapeutic agents by targeted and\/or sustained delivery, were tested for toxicity and safety in animal models and are currently used in humans for resorbable sutures, bone implants and scaffolds in tissue engineering [14 -16] . In cases where adsorption of DNA on the surface was desired, positively charged agents like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were used to produce PLG particles that are positively charged at physiological pH. These particles were able to induce higher antibody and cytotoxic immune responses to HIV-1 pCMV p55 gag plasmid in vivo [21 -23] . Poloxamer 188 (Lutrol F68) was purchased from BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany). A solution of 10% (w\/v) PLGA in Dichloromethane was stirred for 30 min. PEI solution in acetone was prepared to a final concentration of 1% (w\/v). Since the acetone diffused into the aqueous phase rapidly, particles formation was observed immediately by the milky color of the aqueous phase. The dichloromethane was rotor evaporated under reduced pressure and then the suspension was filtered through 4-7 mm retention size paper filter (595 1 2 ) folded filters, Schleicher and Schuell, s'Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands) to remove large polymer particles. This suspension was then used for the loading of DNA. Formulations were left at room temperature for at least 1 h before use. Particle size was measured by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) at 25 8C and a fixed 908 scattering angle. Samples were applied on the filters and left to dry overnight at room temperature. After formation, the nanoparticle suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm and the supernatant was checked for the nonbound DNA concentration with PicoGreen w ds DNA quantitation assay (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) using a Perkin Elmer 7000 Fluorescence Bio assay reader. Calu-3 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 50 mg\/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 8C in an incubator with 90% humidity and 5% CO 2 .

To evaluate the internalization of the DNA loaded PLGA -PEI nanoparticles and their intracellular localization we used the air-interface culture conditions for Calu-3 cells where the apical culture medium is removed after 1 day of culture. Seven days after seeding, rhodamine-labeled plasmid DNA with hCMV IE promoter\/enhancer driving green fluorescent protein gene (pGeneGripe Rhodamine\/GFP, Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA, USA) bound to PLGA -PEI nanoparticles suspended in HBSS -HEPES, pH 7.4 was added to the wells at 1 mg DNA\/well (PLGA -PEI ratio of 10:1; PEI -DNA ratio of 2:1). The particle size of the nanoparticles was between 207 and 231 nm for all PLGA -PEI ratios and PEI -DNA ratios examined ( Table 1 ). calculated that a 10:1 N\/P ratio corresponds to 1.29:1 PEI -DNA weight ratio using the 25 kDa PEI [26] , confirming that at 0.5:1 weight ratio there are still more nitrogen groups present than phosphate.

Therefore, vaccination of susceptible poultry during an HPAIV outbreak might be the best remedy to prevent such transmissions. To this end, suitable formulations and an effective mass vaccination method that can be translated to field settings needs to be developed. Our previous study in chickens has shown that inhalation of a non-adjuvanted dry powder influenza vaccine formulation during normal breathing results in partial protection against lethal influenza challenge. The aim of the present study was to improve the effectiveness of pulmonary vaccination by increasing the vaccine dose deposited in the lungs and by the use of suitable adjuvants. Two adjuvants, namely, Bacterium-like Particles (BLP) and Advax, were spray freeze dried with influenza vaccine into dry powder formulations. Delivery of dry formulations directly at the syrinx revealed that BLP and Advax had the potential to boost either systemic or mucosal immune responses or both. Upon passive inhalation of dry influenza vaccine formulations in an optimized set-up, BLP and Advax\/BLP adjuvanted formulations induced significantly higher systemic immune responses than the nonadjuvanted formulation. Remarkably, all vaccinated animals not only survived a lethal influenza challenge, but also did not show any shedding of challenge virus except for two out of six animals in the Advax group. Overall, our results indicate that passive inhalation is feasible, effective and suitable for mass vaccination of chickens if it can be adapted to field settings.","text_body":"Outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry are the major source of H5N1 infection in humans [1] [2] [3] . These outbreaks, caused by highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza virus, pose a significant risk of poultry-human transmission. Currently, the only remedy to control these outbreaks is to cull the poultry. For safety reasons animals are not only culled on infected farmyards but also on non-infected neighboring farmyards [4, 5] . The slaughter of millions of poultry not only leads to severe economic losses but also raises ethical questions and incomprehension within the society.\r\n To combat outbreaks of avian influenza virus, it could be useful to rapidly vaccinate the poultry in areas surrounding the outbreak, in a ring fencing strategy. However, this would require that very large numbers of poultry, potentially in the tens or hundreds of millions, should be able to be immunized within a very short time period. This would require a vaccine formulation and route of immunization that are suitable for such mass application. Liquid or powder influenza vaccine formulations that can be aerosolized and administered via the respiratory tract could be appropriate formulations for mass vaccination. Liquid formulations of inactivated influenza virus have been shown to be inadequate for aerosol vaccination by single administration [6] . Powder formulations, on the other hand, have shown an advantage over liquid formulations because of their long-term storage stability [7] [8] [9] . This long term stability facilitates stockpiling and thus provides ease of administration during mass vaccination [10] . In a previous study, we have shown that pulmonary immunization by dispersion of a dry powder influenza vaccine directly at the syrinx of chickens (active administration) was able to completely protect these animals against lethal viral challenge [11] . However, in realistic situations, due to extreme time pressures, active administration of chickens is unsuitable for mass vaccination. A more realistic approach would be to let chickens inhale aerosolized dry powder influenza vaccine formulation during breathing (passive administration). Indeed, passive inhalation of dry powder influenza vaccine formulation was feasible in chickens, but the animals were only partially protected indicated by a delay in time to death and reduced virus shedding [11] . Hence, the efficiency of influenza immunization by passive inhalation must be improved for pulmonary vaccination to become feasible. Possible approaches could be to increase the concentration of aerosolized vaccine, to expose the animals to aerosolized powder for longer periods of time and to include an adjuvant in the vaccine formulation. An effective adjuvant should not only be cheap, readily available and potent, but also safe. An adjuvant that has been generally recognized as safe is BLP. BLP are produced by hot acid treatment (pH 1 for 30 min at 99\u00b0C) of Lactococcus lactis, a non-pathogenic, food-grade Gram-positive bacterium [12, 13] . BLP act as Toll-like receptor-2 ligand and have shown potent immune boosting properties when administered together with vaccines against influenza, Yersinia pestis, malaria, and pneumococcal disease [14] [15] [16] [17] . Besides Toll-like receptor ligands, naturally derived polysaccharides, for example Advax\u2122 adjuvant comprising an insoluble isoform of inulin, boosts vaccine responses through mechanism that are still not fully characterized [18] . In (pre) clinical studies Advax has been shown to enhance immune responses induced by a wide variety of vaccines including vaccines against Hepatitis B, SARS coronavirus, listeria and influenza [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Upon parenteral administration, Advax has been shown to have a good safety and tolerability record both in animal studies and clinical trials [25] [26] [27] .\r\n The aim of the current study was to investigate whether passive administration with dry non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted influenza formulations has the potential to completely protect chickens against lethal HPAIV challenge. For this, we initially tested whether (a) BLP or Advax could be co-formulated with influenza vaccine into dry powder formulations that are suitable for pulmonary immunization; (b) the adjuvants have the potential to boost systemic and mucosal immune responses to influenza; (c) passive administration with either non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted influenza formulations would protect chickens against a lethal HPAIV challenge.\r\n For immunization, a reassortant virus, NIBRG-23, prepared by reverse genetics from A\/turkey\/Turkey\/1\/2005 (H5N1) virus and A\/PR\/ 8\/34 (H1N1) virus was used (NIBSC code: 08\/156). The virus was cultured in embryonated chicken eggs by allantoic inoculation of the seed virus. The virus was purified and inactivated as described previously to obtain whole inactivated virus vaccine (WIV) [11, 28] .\r\n For challenge, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strain A\/ turkey\/Turkey\/1\/2005 (H5N1) (Clade 2.2.1), obtained from the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge, UK was used.\r\n For active administration, 5.0, 1.0, and 0.2 \u00b5g HA of NIBRG-23 WIV was SFD either as such or admixed with adjuvants (BLP, Mucosis, Groningen, The Netherlands or Advax, Vaxine, Adelaide, Australia) in various ratios. For active administration, the dose of BLP and Advax in 1 mg of SFD powder was 150 \u00b5g and 500 \u00b5g respectively. WIV was mixed with BLP in weight ratios of HA:BLP of 1:30, 1:150 and 1:750. For WIV-Advax, the weight ratios of HA:Advax were 1:100, 1:500 and 1:2500. Likewise, for passive administration, 5 \u00b5g HA of NIBRG-23 was SFD either as such or mixed with 300 \u00b5g of BLP or 500 \u00b5g of Advax (this dose corresponds to the amount of HA and adjuvants in 1 mg of SFD powder). Both non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted formulations were SFD using inulin (4 kDa, Sensus, Roosendaal, The Netherlands) as the stabilizer. Inulin used for stabilization of influenza vaccine is amorphous and water soluble with potentially no adjuvant effect whereas Advax (delta inulin) is crystalline and insoluble in water with potent adjuvant activity. In brief, a 5% (w\/v) solution of WIV and inulin with or without adjuvants was pumped at a flowrate of 5 ml\/min through a two-fluid nozzle of a B\u00fcchi 190Mini SprayDryer (B\u00fcchi, Flawil, Switzerland). An atomizing airflow of 600 L\/h was used to spray vaccine preparations in a vessel of liquid nitrogen. Then, the frozen vaccine preparations were placed in a Christ Epsilon 2-4 freeze dryer precooled to a shelf temperature of \u221235\u00b0C and at a pressure of 0.220 mbar. The shelf temperature was slowly increased from \u221235\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C within the time period of 32 h. During the next 12 h, the temperature was further increased to 20\u00b0C and pressure was lowered to 0.05 mbar. The dry vaccine powder was collected in a climate box with a relative humidity of < 1% and stored under airtight conditions.\r\n A Philips CM120 transmission electron microscope was used to make transmission electron microscopy images. SFD powders containing WIV (5 \u00b5g HA formulation) with or without adjuvants i.e. BLP (300 \u00b5g in 1 mg of SFD powder), Advax (500 \u00b5g in 1 mg of SFD powder) were reconstituted in sterile filtered water. Liquid and reconstituted SFD formulations were placed on a plain carbon grid, rinsed with water and then samples were stained twice with 5 \u00b5L of 2 wt-% uranyl acetate. A Gatan type UltraScan 4000SP CCD Camera at a magnification was used to take images.\r\n The receptor binding activity of WIV after SFD with or without adjuvants was assessed by hemagglutination assay. SFD powders were reconstituted in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) to a concentration of 20 \u00b5g\/ml of HA. Then, 50 \u00b5L of the preparation was added to 96-well V bottom plates containing 50 \u00b5L of PBS. The entire mixture was two-fold serially diluted, then 50 \u00b5L of 1.5% guinea pig red blood cell suspension was added to each well. The plate was allowed to stand undisturbed for two hours at room temperature. Hemagglutination titers read after two hours were expressed as log 2 of the highest dilution where red blood cell agglutination could be seen.\r\n The capacity of BLP to activate NF-\u03baB via Toll-like receptor-2 was evaluated using RAW-Blue\u2122 cells (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France). RAW-Blue\u2122 cells have a number of pattern recognition receptors which when bound to agonists leads to activation of NF-\u03baB and thus the production of secreted alkaline phosphatase. A schematic illustration is shown in Fig. S1 . Cells were maintained in DMEM with high glucose (Gibco Life Technologies BV, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands), 10% FBS (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), 100 \u00b5g\/ml Normocin\u2122 (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France), 2 mM L-glutamine and passaged when 70-80% confluency was reached. Approximately 5 \u00d7 10 4 cells were added to 96-well flat bottom plates and were stimulated with 1.7 \u00b5g untreated BLP or with liquid and reconstituted SFD powder formulations with (5 \u00b5g HA + 300 \u00b5g BLP formulation) or without 1.7 \u00b5g BLP. The incubation was maintained for 18 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . To measure alkaline phosphatase levels, 150 \u00b5L QUANTI-Blue\u2122 (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France) was added to the cell supernatant and after 1 h, absorbance was measured at 630 nm using a spectrophotometer.\r\n SFD-WIV preparations were imaged using a JEOL JSM 6301-F microscope (JEOL. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Powders were placed on doublesided sticky carbon tape on a metal disc and the particles were coated with approximately 10 nm of gold using a Balzer's 120B sputtering device (Balzer UNION, Liechtenstein). A magnification of 500\u00d7 and 5000\u00d7 was used to capture the images.\r\n Geometrical particle size distribution of the powders were measured using a HELOS compact model KA laser diffraction apparatus (Sympatec GmbH, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany). To disperse the powders, the highly efficient RODOS dispersing system (Sympatec GmbH, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany) was used at a pressure of 1 bar. Aerodynamic particle size distribution was calculated using the equation described by Bhide et al. [29] .\r\n Sixty 3-week old specific-pathogen free chickens (White Leghorn) were randomly divided into 10 groups of 6 animals. Animals were immunized twice i.e. on day 0 and day 14. SFD-WIV formulations (either non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted with BLP or Advax) were administered to the animals using a DP-4-C Dry Powder Insufflator (Penn-Century Inc., Philadelphia, USA). A custom length delivery tube designed to deliver the powder directly at the syrinx was used. Three puffs of 1 ml air were used to aerosolize 1 mg of powder filled in the insufflator. The animals were sacrificed on day 28.\r\n Blood samples were taken on day 0 (before the 1st immunization), day 14 (two weeks after the 1st immunization) and day 28 (two weeks after the 2nd immunization). On the day of sacrifice (day 28), lung lavages were collected by flushing lungs with 20 ml of PBS as described by Holt et al. [30] . The obtained sera and lung lavages were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further use.\r\n An overview of the immunization scheme and groups is shown in Fig. 1A and B.\r\n For passive administration of non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted WIV formulations, 24 3-week old specific-pathogen free chickens were randomly divided into 4 groups of 6 chickens. One animal died of unknown causes before the start of the experiment. Each group was placed in a customized box with a volume of 0.035 m 3 . A 5 ml Eppendorf tube filled with 100 mg of SFD powder containing 0.5 mg HA of NIBRG-23 WIV with or without adjuvants was punctured at the bottom with a 29G hypodermic needle. The lid of the Eppendorf tube was fitted to a pressurized air container while the bottom conical part of the tube was inserted airtight in a hole drilled in the customized box for the dispersion of powders. The SFD powders were aerosolized in the box by using several pulses of pressurized air, resulting in a theoretical concentration of 14 mg HA\/m 3 (HA dose for dispersion: 0.5 mg, inhalation box volume: 0.035 m 3 ). For the first vaccination, the animals were exposed to the aerosolized vaccine for 20 min and after every 2 min short pulses of medicinal oxygen (20 s; flow rate 0.5 L\/min) were supplied through another hole in the box. For the second vaccination (2 weeks later i.e. on day 14) the exposure time was 12 min with short pulses of oxygen (13 s; flow rate 0.5 L\/min) every minute. Based on the respiration rate for chickens of 44 L\/h\/kg body weight [31, 32] these exposure times would result in a maximum theoretical dose of 50 \u00b5g HA per animal per application.\r\n The EID 50 (50% embryo-infectious dose) titre of the challenge strain stock of A\/turkey\/Turkey\/1\/2005 (8.1 log 10 EID 50 \/ml) was used to calculate the dilution for the challenge virus. The 50% chicken lethal dose of A\/turkey\/Turkey\/1\/2005 virus is 2.5 log 10 EID 50 [33] . On day\r\n 28, animals were challenged with a lethal dose of 5.0 log 10 EID 50 of this virus by the combined intranasal\/intratracheal route (liquid suspension; 0.1 ml each). For back titration, we determined TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose). The titre (10log TCID 50 \/ml) after backtitration of the challenge virus that we received from the stables after the challenge inoculation was 4.2 whereas the titre of the original stock was 6.8. Thus, a titre of 8.1 EID 50 \/ml corresponds to 6.8 TCID 50 \/ml. The titre of 4.2 TCID 50 \/ml for the back-titration should therefore correspond to at least 5.0 EID 50 \/ml. Since the 50% chicken lethal dose of the challenge virus is 2.5 log 10 EID 50 , a dose of 4.3 10logEID 50 (0.2 ml of 5.0 EID 50 \/ml) is more than sufficient (> 60\u00d7 CLD 50 ) to kill nonvaccinated animals. In previous studies with the same virus batch and dilution, we found that this dose killed all non-vaccinated control group animals within 2-3 days after the challenge [11, 34] .\r\n In this study, after challenge, animals were observed for clinical signs and on 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days post challenge choanal and cloacal swabs were collected for virus quantification. On day 42, the animals were sacrificed. An overview of the immunization-challenge scheme along with groups is shown in Fig. 1C and D. Passive inhalation of dry formulations could be seen in video file (supplementary data).\r\n Virus titers in choanal and cloacal swabs were determined as per the method described by van der Goot et al. [35] . Challenge virus was tenfold serially diluted, followed by RNA extraction, and a standard curve consisting of the RNA from these serial dilutions was prepared. As per the standard curve, PCR data was converted into equivalent virus titers (eqTCID 50 \/ml).\r\n Serum samples and lung washes were used for the determination of IgY and IgA antibody titers. For the determination of IgY titers, ELISA was performed as previously described [36] , except that the secondary antibody consisted of goat anti chicken IgY-HRP (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, USA). IgY titers were determined as log 10 of the reciprocal of the sample dilution corresponding to an absorbance of 0.2 at the wavelength of 492 nm. IgA titers were determined in lung washes using the commercially available chicken IgA ELISA kit as per manufacturer's instructions (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).\r\n HI assay was performed as described previously [11] . Briefly, 8 hemagglutination units of inactivated virus A\/turkey\/Turkey\/1\/05 (H5N1) were added to two-fold diluted sera samples. HI titers were recorded as highest serum dilution capable of preventing hemagglutination. HI titers are presented on log 2 scale.\r\n Micro-neutralization titers were determined as previously described [37] . Briefly, two-fold serial dilutions of serum samples were prepared and 50 TCID 50 of NIBRG-23 virus was added to each well of 96 well plate. After 2 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the mixture of serum and virus was transferred to MDCK cells (ATCC, Germany) cultured in 96-well flat bottom plate. After 1 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the supernatant was discarded and replaced with Episerf-medium (100 U\/ml penicillin, 100 mg\/ml streptomycin, 1 M HEPES and 7.55% sodium bicarbonate, all Life Technologies\u2122 BV, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands) supplemented with 5 \u00b5g\/ml of TPCK trypsine (Sigma-Adrich, The Netherlands). After 72 h of incubation, the supernatant was transferred to 96 V bottom plate. Micro-neutralization titers were calculated by finding the highest serum dilution capable of preventing hemagglutination. Micro-neutralization titers are presented on log 10 scale.\r\n Mann-Whitney one tailed test was used to compare whether the differences between non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted influenza vaccine formulations were significant. Levels of significance are denoted as * p \u2264 0.05, ** p \u2264 0.01, *** p \u2264 0.001 respectively.\r\n In order to investigate the potential of BLP and Advax as mucosal adjuvants in chickens, it was essential to investigate whether the physical and biological properties of WIV and adjuvants remained unaltered during SFD.\r\n To evaluate whether admixing adjuvants with WIV and SFD had an influence on the physical appearance of WIV, BLP or Advax particles, transmission electron microscopy analysis was performed for these samples before and after SFD. The powder samples were reconstituted prior to use. Transmission electron microscopy pictures showed that WIV, BLP and Advax particles had comparable morphological appearance before and after SFD ( Fig. 2A-C) . Thus, neither the stress encountered during SFD nor admixing adjuvants with WIV had any adverse effect on their physical appearance.\r\n The biological activity of WIV needs to be preserved both after the addition of adjuvants and after SFD. In order to investigate whether the receptor binding activity of HA was preserved, hemagglutination assay was performed. No differences in hemagglutination titers could be detected either by the addition of adjuvants or by SFD, thus indicating no detrimental effects of adjuvants or SFD on the biological activity of HA (Fig. 2D) .\r\n Furthermore, the effect of SFD on the biological activity of BLP was evaluated. For this purpose, reconstituted BLP-adjuvanted SFD WIV formulations were compared to unprocessed dispersion of liquid WIV and BLP for their capacity to activate NF\u03baB using RAW-BLUE\u2122 cells. NIBRG-23 derived WIV alone was found to be a poor activator of NF\u03baB. Reconstituted BLP-adjuvanted WIV formulations activated NF\u03baB to a similar extent as native liquid WIV-BLP dispersion. Thus, stress encountered during SFD had no effect on the biological activity of BLP to activate Toll-like receptor 2 (Fig. 2E ).\r\n To assess whether the incorporation of BLP or Advax in the SFD formulation had an effect on the physical characteristics of powder particles, scanning electron microscopy was used to analyze physical appearance of SFD formulations. Spherical shaped intact particles with an interconnected porous structure could be seen for both non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted WIV formulations. No major differences could be observed in the morphology of SFD particles by varying the dose of HA and by the addition of adjuvants. Representative pictures of nonadjuvanted, BLP and Advax adjuvanted WIV formulation at an HA dose of 0.2 \u00b5g per mg of powder are shown in Fig. 3A -C. Further, upon determination of geometric particle size, average particle size (X 50 ) was found to be between 8 and 12 \u00b5m both for non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted WIV formulations (Fig. 3D) . However, for inhalation, an aerodynamic particle size of 1-5 \u00b5m is considered to be most suitable [29] . The average aerodynamic particle size of non-adjuvanted as well as adjuvanted WIV formulations was calculated according to the formula described by Bhide et al. [29] . The average aerodynamic particle size was found to be \u22643.7 \u00b5m and the majority of the particles (X 90 ) had size \u22645 \u00b5m (Fig. 3E) . Particles with a size range between 1 and 3.7 \u00b5m are considered to be suitable for deposition in the entire respiratory tract of chickens [38] [39] [40] .\r\n Overall, our results indicated that SFD can produce BLP and Advaxadjuvanted WIV particles with physical and biological characteristics that make them suitable for pulmonary vaccination.\r\n For active administration, the tip of the insufflator was placed directly at the syrinx of chickens and three puffs of 1 ml air were used to disperse the powders. We next evaluated the systemic and mucosal immune responses induced in chickens after active administration. Serum IgY and HI titers were measured both at day 14 and day 28 whereas serum MN, lung IgY and IgA titers were measured only at day 28. On day 14, non-adjuvanted as well as adjuvanted WIV formulations had induced considerable serum IgY titers. Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations induced significantly higher serum IgY titers than the corresponding non-adjuvanted WIV formulations (Fig. 4A ). However, no major differences were found among non-adjuvanted and BLP-adjuvanted WIV formulations, except between corresponding 0.2 \u00b5g HA formulations (Fig. 4A) . Although, this difference was statistically significant, it was not major. However, on day 28, significantly higher titers were induced by BLP-adjuvanted WIV formulations than by the non-adjuvanted WIV formulation at an HA dose of 0.2 and 5 \u00b5g; the difference between non-adjuvanted and BLP-adjuvanted formulations was not significant at HA dose of 1 \u00b5g (Fig. 4B) . For Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation, significantly higher titers than corresponding nonadjuvanted WIV formulation were only induced by the 5 \u00b5g HA formulation (Fig. 4B) .\r\n Systemic immune responses were further assessed by determining serum HI titers. It was found that after the first vaccination i.e. at day 14, none of the vaccinated chickens had detectable HI titers (Fig. 4C) . However, after the second vaccination, BLP-adjuvanted WIV formulations, at a dose of 5 and 0.2 \u00b5g HA, induced a trend towards higher HI titers (mean HI titers of 5.2 log 2 and 2.7 log 2 respectively) than corresponding non-adjuvanted WIV formulations (mean HI titers of 4.2 log 2 and 0 respectively) (Fig. 4C ). Though at an HA dose of 5 \u00b5g, the difference was not statistically significant, but at an HA dose of 0.2 \u00b5g, significantly higher titers could be seen for BLP-adjuvanted WIV formulation than corresponding non-adjuvanted formulation. Also, compared to non-adjuvanted WIV formulation (0), a small but non-significant increase in HI titers was seen for the Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation at the lowest HA dose of 0.2 \u00b5g (0.58 log 2 ) (Fig. 4C) . At day 28, micro-neutralization titers were found to be in line with HI titers. In comparison to non-adjuvanted WIV formulation, Advax and BLP-adjuvanted WIV formulations at a dose of 0.2 \u00b5g HA induced an increase in the micro-neutralization titers of about five and eight fold, respectively (Fig. 4D) . No major differences were seen at 5 \u00b5g and 0.2 \u00b5g HA dose.\r\n Mucosal immune responses were assessed by determining IgA and IgY titers in the lung lavages obtained two weeks after the second immunization. Lung IgY titers were found to be consistent with serum IgY \r\n titers after the second immunization. BLP-adjuvanted WIV formulations induced significantly higher lung IgY titers than respective non-adjuvanted WIV formulations at a dose of 0.2 and 5 \u00b5g HA (Fig. 4E ). In addition, Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations induced higher lung IgY titers than non-adjuvanted WIV formulation at an HA dose of 0.2 \u00b5g, though the difference was not significant (Fig. 4E) . Though non-adjuvanted WIV formulations were found to induce considerable lung IgA titers, the inclusion of BLP and Advax further boosted the immune responses (Fig. 4F) . It was found that at a dose of 5 \u00b5g HA, BLP-adjuvanted WIV formulation boosted lung IgA titers (3.6 log 10 ) by approximately four fold in comparison to corresponding non-adjuvanted WIV formulation (3.2 log 10 ) (Fig. 4F) . For Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations, at a dose of 0.2 and 1 \u00b5g HA, lung IgA titers were augmented by three to five fold as compared to corresponding non-adjuvanted WIV formulations (Fig. 4F) .\r\n Passive administration might be a suitable method for mass vaccination of chickens. For passive administration, chickens placed in a custom made box were allowed to inhale aerosolized vaccine powders during breathing using two applications 2 weeks apart. We next evaluated the systemic immune responses induced in chickens after passive administration of these aerosolized powders. Serum IgY titers were determined at day 14 and day 28 whereas micro-neutralization titers were determined at day 28. Adjuvanting with BLP or Advax resulted in significantly higher serum IgY titers at day 14; an increase of about three to five fold could be seen by the co-administration of BLP or Advax with WIV (Fig. 5A) . However, after the second vaccination, only BLP and Advax\/BLP adjuvanted WIV formulations had significantly higher serum IgY titers (4.8-5.1 log 10 ) than non-adjuvanted WIV formulation (4.5 log 10 ) (Fig. 5B) . The augmentation in serum IgY titers was about six-fold for BLP-adjuvanted WIV and three fold for Advax\/ BLP-adjuvanted WIV (Fig. 5B) .\r\n Trends in HI titers were in agreement with serum IgY titers both after the first and second immunization. After the first immunization, all three formulations i.e. BLP, Advax and Advax\/BLP adjuvanted WIV formulations showed significantly higher HI titers (mean HI titers between 3.0 and 3.5 log 2 ) than non-adjuvanted WIV formulation (mean HI titer 1.9 log 2 ) (Fig. 5C) . Notably, after the second immunization, BLP adjuvanted and Advax\/BLP-adjuvanted WIV formulations induced significantly higher HI titers (mean HI titers between 7.8 and 8.4 log 2 ) than non-adjuvanted WIV or Advax adjuvanted WIV (mean HI titers of 5.9 log 2 ). In addition, micro-neutralization titers determined after the second immunization were also in line with serum IgY and HI titers. BLP and Advax\/BLP adjuvanted WIV formulations induced six-fold higher micro-neutralization titers (3.6 log 10 ) than non-adjuvanted WIV formulation (2.9 log 10 ) (Fig. 5D ).\r\n To assess whether passive administration of non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted influenza vaccine formulations, has the potential to reduce\/ diminish the shedding of challenge virus after lethal challenge, virus shedding was determined in choanal and cloacal swabs. In our previous study, we found out that non-vaccinated animals shed virus until they succumbed to infection (3 days post challenge) [11] . In this study, a similar dose of A\/turkey\/Turkey\/1\/2005 virus was used to challenge chickens by the combined intranasal\/intratracheal route. No virus was found either in choanal or cloacal swabs of animals immunized with non-adjuvanted or BLP adjuvanted or Advax\/BLP adjuvanted WIV formulations (Table 1) . Only two animals immunized with Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation showed virus in their choanal swabs ( Table 1) \r\n In this study, we demonstrated that BLP and Advax can be co-formulated with influenza vaccine into a dry formulation that is suitable for pulmonary immunization of chickens. Upon active administration of chickens, the adjuvants BLP and Advax were shown to augment systemic and mucosal immune responses. Remarkably, in an optimized setup, passive administration of chickens either with non-adjuvanted or BLP or Advax adjuvanted WIV formulations induced robust immune responses that were sufficiently high to protect chickens against lethal viral challenge. Furthermore, BLP and Advax\/BLP adjuvantation significantly raised the level of antigen-specific serum antibodies. In real life situations, where passive inhalation would be performed in large rooms, a portion of the aerosolized vaccine formulation would also end up in food and water. However, previous studies have shown that HA of the influenza vaccine undergoes conformational changes at acidic pH and is thus susceptible to proteolytic cleavage in the acidic environment [41, 42] . Consequently, little-no neutralizing antibodies are induced by acidic pH treated influenza vaccine [41, 42] . Therefore, it is speculated that the acidic environment in the stomach of chickens would not really add up to the lung induced mucosal immunity.\r\n The crystalline nature of Advax and peptidoglycans on the surface of BLPs might have detrimental effects on influenza vaccine during the production of adjuvanted dry powder formulations. However, the inclusion of BLP or Advax together with WIV in a formulation led to the formation of dry powder particles of comparable physical and biological characteristics as those of non-adjuvanted WIV formulation. Moreover, the physical properties of adjuvants i.e. their size and shape were found to be unaltered after SFD. Also, the biological activity of BLP was found to be well preserved during SFD. Previous studies have shown that administration of BLP or Advax adjuvanted influenza vaccine formulations via the respiratory tract results in substantial augmentation of systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice [16, [43] [44] [45] [46] . In this study we showed that after active administration, systemic immune responses (serum IgY titers) after one immunization were predominantly enhanced by Advax whereas after two immunizations they (serum IgY, HI titers, micro-neutralization titers) were mainly enhanced by BLP. After two immunizations, both non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted WIV formulations, at an HA dose of 5 \u00b5g, induced average HI titers above 3 log 2 which was previously found to be required for protection against lethal dose of influenza virus [11] . With respect to mucosal immune responses, lung IgY titers were mainly enhanced by BLP whereas lung IgA titers were augmented by both BLP and Advax. Though both BLP and Advax were found to enhance either systemic or mucosal immune responses or both, the observed discrepancies might be due to the dose of BLP (150 \u00b5g) and Advax (500 \u00b5g) used in this study. Although doses of 150 \u00b5g of BLP and 500 \u00b5g of Advax were found to be sufficiently high to boost both systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice, however, these doses might be too low for chickens with a 10x higher body weight. This might have resulted in the adjuvant dose to be a limiting factor in the active administration study. The active administration study revealed a slight but significantly higher effect of both BLP and Advax adjuvants, in comparison to nonadjuvanted WIV formulations. Hence, for the passive administration study, the relative dose of BLP was increased to double, i.e 300 \u00b5g\/mg of SFD powder while keeping the dose of Advax similar. Since Advax particles consisted of 50 wt% of the SFD powder formulation, enhancing the dose of Advax further would most likely have compromised the integrity of the powder particles. Moreover, a pattern of Advax being effective after one and BLP after two immunizations could also be determined in the active administration study. Therefore, one of the groups of passively administered animals inhaled Advax-adjuvanted WIV for the first immunization and BLP-adjuvanted WIV for the second immunization.\r\n In our previous study, passive inhalation led to in-efficient delivery of influenza vaccine powders to the lungs of chickens and thus provided only partial protection [11] . Hence, for this study, we aimed for complete protection against lethal influenza viral challenge. This was achieved by enhancing vaccine powder delivery to the lungs: by increasing the vaccine concentration (by reducing the size of inhalation box), by increasing the exposure time, and by the use of adjuvants. Compared to our previous study, optimization of the vaccine concentration and exposure time resulted in an increment of \u223c7 fold in the theoretical vaccine dose (this study 2 \u00d7 50 \u00b5g HA\/animal; previous study 3 \u00d7 5 \u00b5g HA\/animal) [11] . Using this optimized set-up, passive inhalation of both non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted WIV formulations not only protected chickens against clinical signs after HPAIV challenge, but also almost completely prevented challenge virus shedding. These results are a significant improvement over our previous study in which chickens showed partial protection and challenge virus shedding even after three immunizations. Though the immunological mechanism that governed complete protection in chickens by passive administration of non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted WIV formulations still needs to be investigated, the shedding data indicate that mucosal immune responses were high enough to prevent production of substantial amounts of virus. In addition to mucosal immune responses, an important class of immune responses are those elicited systemically. At both time points, BLP and Advax\/BLP adjuvanted WIV formulations, were found to induce higher systemic immune responses than non-adjuvanted or Advax-adjuvanted WIV preparation. In addition, we found out that, either of the two adjuvants i.e. Advax or BLP would be appropriate for first immunization, however, for second immunization, BLP was vital. Although these adjuvanted WIV formulations elicited significantly higher immune responses than non-adjuvanted WIV formulation, the fact that even the non-adjuvanted WIV formulations provided complete protection, suggests that the use of an adjuvant was not critical for protection via passive inhalation, but it might add to dose-sparing of influenza vaccines for future passive inhalation studies.\r\n In conclusion, our results show that, vaccination by passive inhalation of dry influenza vaccine powders is suitable to induce protective immunity in chickens against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. It not only has the potential to completely protect chickens from morbidity and mortality, and to prevent the virus from spreading, but also seems to be a feasible option for mass vaccination of chickens. The challenge now remains to translate passive inhalation vaccination from the box to real-world field settings.\r\n NP is affiliated with Vaxine Pty Ltd, which has commercial interests in Advax adjuvant.

Currently, the only remedy to control these outbreaks is to cull the poultry. Liquid formulations of inactivated influenza virus have been shown to be inadequate for aerosol vaccination by single administration [6] . However, in realistic situations, due to extreme time pressures, active administration of chickens is unsuitable for mass vaccination. For challenge, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strain A\/ turkey\/Turkey\/1\/2005 (H5N1) (Clade 2.2.1), obtained from the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge, UK was used. WIV was mixed with BLP in weight ratios of HA:BLP of 1:30, 1:150 and 1:750. Likewise, for passive administration, 5 \u00b5g HA of NIBRG-23 was SFD either as such or mixed with 300 \u00b5g of BLP or 500 \u00b5g of Advax (this dose corresponds to the amount of HA and adjuvants in 1 mg of SFD powder). Then, the frozen vaccine preparations were placed in a Christ Epsilon 2-4 freeze dryer precooled to a shelf temperature of \u221235\u00b0C and at a pressure of 0.220 mbar. A Philips CM120 transmission electron microscope was used to make transmission electron microscopy images. SFD powders were reconstituted in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) to a concentration of 20 \u00b5g\/ml of HA. The plate was allowed to stand undisturbed for two hours at room temperature. The capacity of BLP to activate NF-\u03baB via Toll-like receptor-2 was evaluated using RAW-Blue\u2122 cells (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France). A schematic illustration is shown in Fig. Cells were maintained in DMEM with high glucose (Gibco Life Technologies BV, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands), 10% FBS (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), 100 \u00b5g\/ml Normocin\u2122 (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France), 2 mM L-glutamine and passaged when 70-80% confluency was reached. SFD-WIV preparations were imaged using a JEOL JSM 6301-F microscope (JEOL. A magnification of 500\u00d7 and 5000\u00d7 was used to capture the images. Geometrical particle size distribution of the powders were measured using a HELOS compact model KA laser diffraction apparatus (Sympatec GmbH, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany). A custom length delivery tube designed to deliver the powder directly at the syrinx was used. Three puffs of 1 ml air were used to aerosolize 1 mg of powder filled in the insufflator. An overview of the immunization scheme and groups is shown in Fig. 1A and B.\r\n For passive administration of non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted WIV formulations, 24 3-week old specific-pathogen free chickens were randomly divided into 4 groups of 6 chickens. One animal died of unknown causes before the start of the experiment. The SFD powders were aerosolized in the box by using several pulses of pressurized air, resulting in a theoretical concentration of 14 mg HA\/m 3 (HA dose for dispersion: 0.5 mg, inhalation box volume: 0.035 m 3 ). For the first vaccination, the animals were exposed to the aerosolized vaccine for 20 min and after every 2 min short pulses of medicinal oxygen (20 s; flow rate 0.5 L\/min) were supplied through another hole in the box. On day\r\n 28, animals were challenged with a lethal dose of 5.0 log 10 EID 50 of this virus by the combined intranasal\/intratracheal route (liquid suspension; 0.1 ml each). For back titration, we determined TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose). The titre of 4.2 TCID 50 \/ml for the back-titration should therefore correspond to at least 5.0 EID 50 \/ml. Micro-neutralization titers were determined as previously described [37] . After 2 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the mixture of serum and virus was transferred to MDCK cells (ATCC, Germany) cultured in 96-well flat bottom plate. Micro-neutralization titers were calculated by finding the highest serum dilution capable of preventing hemagglutination. Micro-neutralization titers are presented on log 10 scale. Levels of significance are denoted as * p \u2264 0.05, ** p \u2264 0.01, *** p \u2264 0.001 respectively. To evaluate whether admixing adjuvants with WIV and SFD had an influence on the physical appearance of WIV, BLP or Advax particles, transmission electron microscopy analysis was performed for these samples before and after SFD. The powder samples were reconstituted prior to use. The average aerodynamic particle size of non-adjuvanted as well as adjuvanted WIV formulations was calculated according to the formula described by Bhide et al. [ The average aerodynamic particle size was found to be \u22643.7 \u00b5m and the majority of the particles (X 90 ) had size \u22645 \u00b5m (Fig. Serum IgY and HI titers were measured both at day 14 and day 28 whereas serum MN, lung IgY and IgA titers were measured only at day 28. Although, this difference was statistically significant, it was not major. Mucosal immune responses were assessed by determining IgA and IgY titers in the lung lavages obtained two weeks after the second immunization. In addition, Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations induced higher lung IgY titers than non-adjuvanted WIV formulation at an HA dose of 0.2 \u00b5g, though the difference was not significant (Fig. Passive administration might be a suitable method for mass vaccination of chickens. We next evaluated the systemic immune responses induced in chickens after passive administration of these aerosolized powders. Notably, after the second immunization, BLP adjuvanted and Advax\/BLP-adjuvanted WIV formulations induced significantly higher HI titers (mean HI titers between 7.8 and 8.4 log 2 ) than non-adjuvanted WIV or Advax adjuvanted WIV (mean HI titers of 5.9 log 2 ). In addition, micro-neutralization titers determined after the second immunization were also in line with serum IgY and HI titers. Remarkably, in an optimized setup, passive administration of chickens either with non-adjuvanted or BLP or Advax adjuvanted WIV formulations induced robust immune responses that were sufficiently high to protect chickens against lethal viral challenge.

We speculate that exposure to injurious agents in early postnatal life may inhibit natural remodeling and thereby enhance later vulnerability to airway hyperreactivity.","text_body":"Anatomical studies in human premature infants and various animal models have demonstrated a well developed and well innervated airway smooth muscle layer in late fetal and early postnatal life (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . In combination with the small caliber intrapulmonary airways that are present during early development, this may predispose premature infants to airway obstruction and impaired ventilation. Furthermore, the risk of airway hyperreactivity and need for asthma medication in former premature infants when compared to their term counterparts is increased over two to three fold respectively (6) (7) (8) (9) . Nonetheless, maturational change in reflex pathways regulating control of lower airway patency during early development has not been adequately studied.\r\n Cholinergic outflow to the airways depends on sensory input received from the lungs, which modulates airway-related vagal preganglionic neurons (AVPNs) in the brainstem (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Efferent neural output from AVPNs located in the rostral nucleus ambiguus (rNA) is modulated by afferent input to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) from lung afferents such as slowly adapting stretch receptors, C-fibers and rapidly adapting receptors (10, 12, (16) (17) (18) . However, there is limited information on physiologic and developmental changes in maturation of airway reflex responses from lung afferents to airway smooth muscle. Prior studies have focused on C-fiber influences on ventilatory muscle responses rather than airway regulation (19) (20) (21) . Haxhiu-Poskurica et al., (22) characterized 2-10 week old piglets' responses to C-fiber stimulation and the resultant changes in tracheal smooth muscle tone; they documented immaturity of reflex responses of airway smooth muscle tone during early postnatal life when compared to reflex pathways regulating ventilatory responses. These results supported earlier studies demonstrating a diminished hypoxia-induced increase in airway smooth muscle tone in newborn dogs (23) , but it is unclear from these physiological studies whether airway reflex pathways are anatomically intact at an early postnatal age.\r\n Ferrets have proven to be a useful animal model of human viral disease affecting the respiratory system (24, 25) . Furthermore, similarities between human and ferret development of cholinergic neurons and airway smooth muscle innervation have suggested that this species is a favorable model for studying human respiratory neuronal reflex pathways (13, 17, 26) . In a previous study done in our laboratory (27) , the chemical profile of vagal preganglionic motor cells projecting to the airways was characterized in adult ferrets. AVPNs found within the rNA were shown to be cholinergic in nature and their stimulation resulted in a release of acetylcholine leading to contraction of airway smooth muscle. However, it is not known whether these cholinergic traits are expressed at an early postnatal age. Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that early postnatal maturation is associated with developmental change in both the density of afferent fibers reaching the NTS and the number of efferent AVPNs within the rNA, which project to the airways.\r\n Studies were performed in healthy European ferret pups, Mustella putorius furo (Marshall Farm, N.Y.) weighing between 38 -190g. All experiments were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Case Western Reserve University. Ferret pups were housed with the mother on a regular day\/night cycle (lights on from 06:00 to 18:00h) at 24\u00b0C and 55% relative humidity.\r\n To determine developmental changes of the central sensory and motor innervation of the airways, four groups of ferret pups were injected with 50 \u03bcL CT-b (List Biological Laboratories, Inc., Campbell, CA), a transganglionic retrograde tracer, dissolved in distilled water (1 mg\/ml). Injections were performed on postnatal days 7 (n = 8), 14 (n = 4), 21 (n = 4) and 42 (n = 3) into the upper lobe of the right lung (12, 27, 28) . After the procedure, ferret pups were returned to their mothers and were monitored for any complications. Five days following the CT-b injections, animals were deeply anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (50 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/kg respectively; ip), perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde made in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Brains were removed, post fixed in the same fixative for 2 days, and then transferred to 30% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for cryoprotection. Transverse sections of the brainstem were sliced at 40 \u03bcm using a Cryostat (Leica CM1850, Leica Microsystems, Heidelberger, Strasse) and stored in 0.2 % sodium azide in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. In a second set of experiments following an identical protocol, eight 7-dayold animals were injected with 25 \u03bcL of CT-b into the upper lobe of the right lung, to evaluate the effect of a lower CT-b volume on labeled brain cells at the younger age.\r\n The immunohistochemical procedures for dual staining of tissue sections for visualization of CT-b labeled AVPNs have been reported in our previous study (27) . Briefly, free floating 1in-5 series tissue sections were washed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4) three times for 10 min each followed by incubation in PBS containing 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 mins to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were washed in PBS and then incubated 2 times for 10 min each in 0.3% Triton-X in PBS. Tissues were then placed into a blocking medium containing 1 % Albumin bovine serum (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 30min. Sections were incubated for 24h at 4\u00b0C in goat polyclonal anti-choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA; 1:500) (27) . Sections were washed in 0.3% Triton-X in PBS and incubated for 2h in a 1:200 solution of donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Texas Red, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The sections were then washed in 0.3% Triton-X in PBS three times; each for 10 min. Sequential immunofluorescent detection of CTb was performed after the ChAT labeling protocol was completed. The sections were incubated in a 1:20,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-CT-b (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corporation, Westbury, NY) for 36h. Sections were washed in 0.3% Triton-X in PBS and incubated for 2h in a 1:200 solution of donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc, West Grove, PA). In control experiments for ChAT and CT-b labeling, primary antibodies were omitted. Sections were then rinsed in PBS three times for 10 min each, mounted on Superfrost \u00ae\/Plus microscope slides and cover-slipped using Vecta Shield (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA).\r\n 1 in 5 sections were carefully selected from 0.0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.5 mm rostral to the obex as defined previously by our group (12) . The obex was considered as a zero point. For consistency, the sections from the all the groups were selected and analyzed by the same individual. Slides were viewed with a fluorescent microscope (Leica DMLB, Leica Microsystems, Heidelberger, Strasse). Colocalization of ChAT and CT-b protein was identified by alternating between fluorescent filters. Images were acquired from the same area of the section for both traits, digitized, and stored as TIFF files for data analysis. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM at each age. Statistical comparisons for CT-b labeled AVPNs between age groups were made by using one-way ANOVA (Student-Neuman-Keuls; significance at p \u2264 0.05).\r\n To determine the CT-b labeled afferent nerve terminals in the NTS at different levels from the obex, we used the same animals and brainstem slices from 7 and 14 day old animals that were used in the previous experiment, where animals were injected with 50 \u03bcL of CT-b into the right lung. Confocal images (Leica DMIRE2, Leica Microsystems, Heidelberger, Strasse) were taken at 4-\u03bcm intervals to avoid double counting and optical stacks of images (Z-sectioning) were acquired from the same section, digitized, and stored as TIFF files. To standardize and unbias the data analysis, gain and offset were kept at the same level for all age groups. The density of CT-b labeled axon terminals ending in the NTS region was also counted and the total optical density (OD) per unit volume per level was collated using NIH ImageJ software. Images were analyzed keeping the same threshold parameter for all age groups and the investigator who analyzed the images was blinded to the animals' age.\r\n We initially quantified cells labeled for CT-b only at each age group to characterize neuroanatomic connections between the lungs and cell bodies within the brainstem. In sections selected from 0.0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.5 mm rostral to the obex, retrogradely labeled CT-b cell bodies were located in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and in the rNA. In this study, we focused on the rNA because this is the major site controlling neural output to airways. CT-b labeled cells within the rNA were found both in the compact as well as loose portion of the rNA, which lies just below the compact portion. The mean number of CT-b labeled cells combined for all levels was significantly higher (p < 0.05) at 7 days (125 \u00b1 10, n = 8) as compared to 14 (60 \u00b1 9, n = 4), 21(63 \u00b1 5, n = 4), and 42 (38 \u00b1 16, n = 3) day old pups ( Figure  1 ). Although sample sizes were small in the older age groups, the assumption of normality of data within groups was met and hence we used one-way ANOVA for the analysis. There was no statistical significance in the CT-b labeled cell counts between the older age groups.\r\n As a significant decline in CT-b labeled cell bodies occurred between 7 and 14 postnatal days, and the weight of ferret pups approximately doubled from 7 to 14 days, one half (25 \u03bcL) of the original CT-b dose (50 \u03bcL) was injected into the right lung in eight additional 7 day old ferret pups. This was done to confirm that the increased cell count at the rNA region in the 7 day old group was not due to a higher CT-b dose per body weight. There were no statistical differences (p = 0.16) between the 7-day-old ferret group injected with 50 \u03bcL (125 \u00b1 10, n = 8) and the 7-day-old ferret group injected with 25 \u03bcL (101 \u00b1 6, n = 8). Furthermore, the number of CT-b labeled cells in the 7-day-old ferret groups injected with 25 \u03bcL was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the number of cells in the older groups injected with 50 \u03bcL.\r\n In order to determine the neuraxis level that expressed the majority of cells that projected to the airways, CT-b labeled cells were counted at different levels (0.0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.5 mm) from the obex in all the animals. The 7-day-old group showed a consistent trend toward more cells at each neuraxis level ( Figure 2) . Overall, for all groups, the rNA region at 3.5 mm rostral to the obex showed the densest projection to the airways ( Figure 2) .\r\n We subsequently quantified the number of CT-b labeled cells that were double labeled with ChAT, a cholinergic marker and enzyme that synthesizes acetylcholine. All the CT-b labeled rNA cells expressed ChAT, confirming that CT-b labeled airway-related vagal preganglionic neurons are cholinergic in nature ( Figure 3 ).\r\n Finally, we sought to determine whether age-dependent changes in efferent innervation of the airways from the brainstem are also seen in the afferent innervation of the respiratory reflex pathway to the NTS. We used confocal microscope sections of the tissues at 4\u03bcm intervals to determine the total relative number of \"puncta\" or optical density (OD) per \u03bcm 3 within the NTS sub-nuclei. We analyzed the density of anterogradely-labeled CT-b afferent fiber projection to the NTS at 7 and 14 days. We chose these two critical time frames based on our initial labeling study with the efferent projection to the airways where the data showed significantly higher CT-b-labeled cells in the AVPNs between the 7 and 14 day-old ferret groups. Our data showed afferent labeling in the ventrolateral and commissural sub-nuclei of the NTS. The density of CT-b labeled afferent fibers was much higher at the younger age. The 7 day old animals (n = 4) had an average optical density of 1.23 OD\/\u03bcm 3 (SEM = 0.29) compared to 0.13 OD\/\u03bcm 3 (SEM = 0.02) in 14 day old animals (n = 4). The highest density was observed at 0.0 and 1.5 mm rostral to the obex (P < 0.05) (Figure 4 ).\r\n This study was designed to determine whether there is a maturational difference in the number of efferent AVPNs projecting from the rNA to the lungs and whether this change is also observed in the density of afferent fibers projecting from the lungs to the NTS in a ferret model. Using CT-b as a retrograde tracer, we were able to identify the vagal preganglionic neurons projecting to the airways. We chose 7, 14, and 21 and 42 day old ferret pups to study agedependent changes in airway projection. We found that when animals were injected intrapulmonary with 50 \u03bcL CT-b, the number of CT-b labeled cells is significantly higher in the 7-day-old group when compared to the older groups. Between 7 and 14 days, the number of labeled cells in the 14-day-old group is significantly diminished. When a second group of animals was injected at 7 days with half of the original dose of CT-b to match the CT-b dose\/ body weight, there was no significant difference in the CT-b labeled cell count between the 7day-old groups injected with either 50 or 25 \u03bcL of CT-b, indicating that the higher number of CT-b labeled cells is not related to a higher dose\/body weight. Regardless of the CT-b dose injected at 7 days, the number of CT-b labeled cells was significantly higher than at later ages. These findings strongly suggest that the number of efferent AVPNs is higher at a younger age and diminishes with maturation.\r\n In the adult ferret, AVPNs projecting to the airways were found from 0.0 mm to 3.5 mm rostral to the obex with the predominance of the labeling at 3.5 mm (11) . In this study, we also quantified the number of cells seen at different brainstem levels to determine whether the maturational changes we observed were specific to a given area within the brainstem or more ubiquitous. Regardless of age group, the ferret pups showed the densest projection to the airways at 3.5 mm rostral to the obex. Furthermore, we determined that AVPNs that project to the airways were cholinergic in nature by double immunolabeling with ChAT. This suggests that following their activation AVPNs release acetylcholine in the intrinsic ganglia and thereby regulate airway smooth muscle tone (17) .\r\n We also characterized the optical density of afferent fibers projecting to the NTS. NTS subnuclei are involved in tracheobronchial and respiratory reflexes as they receive information from airway receptors such as pulmonary c-fibers, rapidly adapting and slowly adapting receptors. Our study showed afferent labeling in the ventrolateral and commissural sub-nuclei of the NTS, the primary sensory afferent relay center in the brainstem. The density of CT-b labeled fibers in the 7-day-old ferret pups was higher than in the 14-day-old ferret group. This suggests that similar maturational changes occur in both afferent innervation to the NTS and efferent AVPN projection to the airways.\r\n Our observation of a decline in efferent cell bodies and afferent fibers is consistent with prior observations of neuronal death accompanying normal development in the central nervous system (29) . These studies described programmed cell death in areas such as the developing trigeminal system, olivocerebral system, cochlear nucleus and other areas (29) (30) (31) (32) . To our knowledge, there are no studies related to the evolution of programmed cell death for AVPNs in the rNA, which is part of the central airway reflex pathway. Our findings of a decrease in the number of AVPNs (in addition to the decrease in fiber density) support a role for developmental remodeling of neural circuits involved in autonomic control of airway caliber. Although experiments determining programmed cell death would have substantiated our hypothesis, it was beyond the scope of this project. Further studies employing techniques such as TUNEL testing and caspace-3 staining in this or comparable immature animal models are needed to support a role for apoptosis in the developmental remodeling we proposed.\r\n Murphy et al., (33) examined the role maturation serves in airway contractile responses in swine. They found an increase in force generation as well as sensitivity to vagal stimulation in the younger animals, and they suggested that a decrease in contractile response in older animals could be related to parasympathetic neural function and maturation in the activity of acetylcholinesterase. These studies are however related to alteration in receptor\/transductional changes associated with acetylcholine muscarinic receptor responses. In our study, we have shown that there is also a neuroanatomical change during maturation. The present results showing a higher density of fibers coupled with greater number of cells during early life contrasts with the relatively weak airway smooth muscle contractile response as previously demonstrated at that age (22) . We speculate that upregulation of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons and\/or other inhibitory inputs to the common efferent pathway contribute to immature reflex responses in young animals in the face of an intact neuroanatomic reflex pathway. Furthermore, peripheral relaxant responses such as those mediated by prostaglandins may also contribute to relaxation in young animals (34) in response to a strong cholinergic efferent output from the brainstem.\r\n Interspecies differences also complicate the comparison of physiologic and neuroanatomic findings. Ferret airway smooth muscle neurobiology and neural circuitry including the cholinergic system is similar to humans and thereby serves as a good model to study airway control (35) . Furthermore, ferrets have been successfully used to study human viral disease affecting the respiratory system (25) . We have recently shown that allergen exposure and repeated challenges, presumably causing lung inflammation in the adult ferret, diminish central inhibitory noradrenergic modulation of AVPNs partly via down-regulation of \u03b12A-adrenergic receptors expressed by the AVPNs (36) .\r\n There are a few limitations to the methods that we have employed in our study. CT-b was used as a retrograde transganglionic tracer and experienced personnel injected CT-b into the lungs; however, we cannot rule out differences in the exact location of CT-b injection within the lung and the effect that this may have on distribution of the labeled cells within the brainstem. It is possible that in the present study, not all vagal preganglionic neurons that innervate the airway system could be labeled and therefore the number of cells reported reflects the labeled-AVPNs rather than the actual number of AVPNs that innervate the airways. These results are consistent with previous experiments conducted in adult ferrets in our laboratory (14, 19) . One must also be cautious when interpreting the distribution of afferent terminations in the NTS. Our confocal microscopy results did not differentiate between synaptic contacts and fibers of passage within the NTS. We used a design that allows morphometric quantification of these structures within the NTS sub-nuclei while avoiding double counting. Finally the ferret pup is a useful but fragile animal model for studying airway innervation and our statistical analyses in the older age groups are somewhat limited by small number of animals.\r\n Our data in the immature ferret indicate that neural innervation undergoes maturational change in the second week of life, which constitutes a normal maturational phenomenon. Increased density of both afferent and efferent pathways controlling the airways in early life may enhance the vulnerability of infants to activation of respiratory reflexes. We speculate that exposure to injurious chemical or mechanical stimulation such as exposure to high inhaled oxygen, mechanical injury during intubation, or nicotine inhalation in early life may inhibit the natural remodeling we have observed and even change the phenotype resulting in predisposition to airway hyperreactivity later in life.

In the past 10e15 years, the role of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has expanded, not least in an attempt to minimize the complications inherent with invasive ventilation. As such, NIV is now considered first-line therapy in some conditions (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary oedema, mild-to-moderate hypoxaemic respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients), and a 'trial of NIV' is often considered in respiratory failure resulting from an increasingly wide range of causes. When using NIV, the importance of the environment (setting, monitoring and experience of staff ) and forward planning cannot be overemphasized. When used for other than the standard indications, NIV should be employed in a high-dependency\/intensive care setting only in patients for whom invasive ventilation would be considered.","text_body":"Indications for ventilation Early identification of critically ill patients, before the occurrence of significant cardio-respiratory decompensation, is one of the major goals of critical care outreach programmes. Patients who require ventilatory support often develop a common pattern of physiological deterioration including:\r\n increasing respiratory rate asynchronous respiratory pattern a change in mentation and level of consciousness frequent oxygen desaturation despite increasing oxygen concentration hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis circulatory problems, including hypotension and atrial dysrhythmias.\r\n The modern ventilator is a complex computer-driven tool and a detailed description of its modes and use are beyond the scope of this article (see Further reading). In simple terms, it mixes air under pressure with variable oxygen concentrations to provide inspiration and expiration, each 'breath' is characterized by three factors, which can be adjusted by the operator; Trigger: the ventilator can deliver a breath according to a timer that defines a specific set rate (ventilator initiated\/ mandatory breaths), or as a result of the patient's own breathing efforts effecting a change in the pressure or flow in the ventilator circuit (patient-initiated\/spontaneous breaths).\r\n Target: the flow of air into the lung can be to a specific target flow rate (volume control) or pressure (pressure control; pressure support; bi-level) Termination: the signal for the ventilator to finish inspiration and allow expiration (passive) may be the achievement of a specific volume (volume-cycled: volume control), after a specific time (time-cycled: pressure control\/bi-level) or following the reduction of inspiratory flow to a preset level (flow-cycled: pressure support)\r\n NIV refers to the provision of respiratory support without direct tracheal intubation. As such, it aims to avoid some of the complications inherent with invasive ventilation, such as the need for sedation with risks of haemodynamic instability and subsequent risk of delirium, nosocomial infection, etc. 1 In a recent worldwide survey, use of NIV increased from 4% to 11% of all episodes of mechanical ventilation between 2001 and 2004 respectively, with even higher rates of use in some European countries. 2 Indeed, for some situations it is considered the first-choice mode of ventilatory support ( NIV today consists almost exclusively of the delivery of positive pressure ventilation via an external interface. There are six broad types of interface available, each with its own particular benefits and drawbacks (see Further reading):\r\n total face masks (enclose mouth, nose eyes) full face masks (enclose mouth and nose) nasal mask (covers nose but not mouth) mouthpieces (placed between lips and held in place by lip seal) nasal pillows or plugs (inserted into nostrils) helmet (covers the whole head\/all or part of the neck e no contact with face). NIV can be delivered using most modern 'intensive care' ventilators. For sicker patients this has several advantages (ability to deliver higher and precise concentrations of oxygen; separate inspiratory\/expiratory limbs minimizing re-breathing of CO 2 ; better monitoring\/alarm features; and rapid access to invasive ventilation). Outside of the ICU, NIV is commonly applied using smaller, 'simpler' but increasingly sophisticated 'non-invasive' ventilators, which can provide a range of respiratory support modes. Pressure-cycled modes are generally preferred (accommodation of leaks), and breaths can be either patient-triggered (pressure support or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP)), or initiated and controlled by the ventilator (pressure control). Indeed, both modes are often used synergistically to provide back up when triggering is poor or if patient respiratory rate is unreliable, and to cover potential apnoeic episodes.\r\n Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure Patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory acidosis secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), represent the most extensively studied group, and the greatest evidence for benefit exists in COPD. 3e6 Numerous studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that use of NIV is associated with reduced risks of treatment failure (RR 0.48), lower intubation rates (RR 0.41) with lower incidence of nosocomial infections, and a reduction in mortality (RR 0.52) with subsequent reduced hospital length of stay and costs. 7 These benefits have been shown predominantly in patients with mild-to-moderate hypercapnic respiratory failure (pH 7.30e7.34). As such, NIV should be considered first-line therapy for this patient group, and can be safely used in appropriately staffed and monitored environments outside of the ICU. 4 This does not preclude the use of NIV in patients with more severe respiratory failure, 8e10 and a pH as low as 7.20 may still be compatible with favourable outcomes. However, such patients should be managed in a high-dependency environment, to allow for rapid escalation to intubation and invasive ventilation if appropriate.\r\n The importance of an established structure for effective NIV delivery cannot be overemphasized. Early initiation by experienced and skilled staff, appropriate environments and monitoring, and protocols to aid patient selection and subsequent decision making are key to the successful and safe application of NIV in all forms of respiratory failure 11 ( Figure 1 ).\r\n Although treatment failure is uncommon in mild-to-moderate respiratory failure, it becomes increasingly frequent in sicker (lower pH and\/or significant hypoxaemia) patients (Table 2) . Common causes of NIV failure include interface leaks and patient asynchrony with the ventilator ( Table 2 ). In experienced hands, such issues can be recognized early and rapidly remedied; if this is not possible, intubation and invasive ventilation will need to be considered. 11, 12 The appropriateness of invasive ventilation in patients with COPD can be a contentious issue. However, recent evidence suggests more favourable outcomes than predicted, with stable or even improved quality of life in most patients. 13 Decisions about the extent of future intervention should be made by a senior physician, taking into account factors such as functional status, previous pulmonary function tests, existing comorbidities, body mass index, the need for long-term oxygen therapy and the patient's expressed wishes; ideally before the initiation of NIV. The outcome should be documented in the medical record and communicated to the patient\/family as appropriate.\r\n Recommendations based on levels of evidence 21 Level 1 evidence Systematic reviews (with homogeneity) of RCTs and individual RCTs (with narrow CIs) Evidence of use (favourable) Acute pulmonary oedema The use of NIV (including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)) to treat respiratory failure secondary to acute pulmonary oedema is widespread. 14e17 Several meta-analyses have established benefit, including decreased intubation rate (CPAP\/ bi-level) and mortality (CPAP) compared to standard medical therapy. 18 However, these findings were not borne out in a recent randomized control trial, 19 even though physiological improvements occurred earlier in the NIV arms (CPAP\/bi-level). The low rate of intubation (<3%), and the potential for crossover between the study arms may have limited the ability to document improvements with NIV. The European Cardiology Task Force 20 for diagnosis and treatment of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema recommends NIV\/CPAP as first-line treatments in addition to standard medical therapy when respiratory failure is present.\r\n There is conflicting evidence for the use of NIV in hypoxaemic respiratory failure. 21e24 A recent meta-analysis where NIV in addition to standard therapy was compared to standard therapy alone, in hypoxaemic respiratory failure not related to\r\n \u2022Diagnose need for NIV ( Fig. 1;2 pulmonary oedema, reported improvements in intubation rate, mortality and hospital length of stay with the use of NIV. 22 However the literature in this area is hampered by marked heterogeneity between the study populations in both cause and severity of respiratory failure e in particular the frequency of pre-existing COPD. Therefore, although some studies suggest benefit, routine use of NIV in severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) cannot be recommended. However, in immunocompromised patients, studies have shown early NIV use to be beneficial in the management of hypoxic respiratory failure, particular in patients with solid organ transplantation, haematological malignancies and HIV infection. 25e27 NIV should be considered in such patients, preferably in a highdependency\/ICU environment with rapid access to invasive ventilation and multi-organ support.\r\n In an attempt to limit exposure to the risks of invasive mechanical ventilation, NIV is being used increasingly to promote earlier extubation and prevent re-intubation. Present evidence suggests it is most likely to be beneficial in COPD patients, medical patients with multiple morbidities who are likely to fail on extubation and those with hypercapnia during spontaneous breathing trials. 28 \r\n With increasing expertize in its use, it is not surprising that clinicians have been keen to exploit the potential benefits of NIV over invasive ventilation in other 29, 30 forms of respiratory compromise (Table 1) . It is important to recognize that in some conditions the literature represents small series from experienced centres and the importance of the environment and forward planning cannot be overemphasized. In these circumstances we would recommend that NIV should be employed in an intensive care setting only if invasive ventilation would be considered for the patient.\r\n Invasive mechanical ventilation requires access to the trachea, most commonly via an endotracheal tube, and represents the commonest reason for admission to the ICU. Large multinational surveys confirm the common indications for invasive ventilation to be: 2 coma 16% COPD 13% ARDS 11% heart failure 11% pneumonia 11% sepsis 11% trauma 11% postoperative complications 11% neuromuscular disorders 5%.\r\n Decisions about the initiation and timing of invasive ventilation can be difficult and early discussion with critical care colleagues is essential. Appropriateness of ventilatory support may also be an issue requiring advanced discussion with patients and families. Once a decision to intubate has been made, the transition from an awake and self-ventilating patient to controlled invasive ventilation can be very difficult in the critically ill. Most patients will have evidence of developing or established organ dysfunction, particularly cardiovascular dysfunction (ischaemic heart disease, sepsis), and commonly such patients are hypovolaemic. Both anaesthetic induction agents and positive pressure ventilation (which decreases venous return) produce cardiovascular depression and peri-intubation hypotension is common. In addition, cessation of spontaneous ventilation can lead to very rapid desaturation in such patients, due to their marginal respiratory reserve and circulatory problems. Such consequences need to be anticipated: large-volume cannulae should be in place; access to plasma expanders and inotropes should be immediately available; and following induction of anaesthesia the airway must be rapidly secured by an experienced member of the critical care team e ideally in an appropriately equipped area of the hospital. Descriptions of individual ventilatory strategies are beyond the scope of this chapter. However, over the past 10e20 years there has been increasing recognition that invasive ventilation, although lifesaving, can be associated with significant complications, such as nosocomial pneumonia, critical illness neuromyopathy syndromes and barotrauma (pneumothoraces); and ventilation itself may be associated with propagation of underlying lung injury and subsequent worsening of multi-organ failure. 31, 32 The landmark NIH ARDS network trial 33 confirmed that in patients with acute lung injury, the use of a reduced tidal volume (6 ml\/kg) and avoidance of high airway pressures (<30 cmH 2 O) were associated with improved mortality (31% vs. 39.8% (NNTz11)) when compared with a conventional ventilatory approach. Although it is not without controversy, 34 this and subsequent studies form the basis for management of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure. Although individual patients differ, key concepts include:\r\n Low tidal volume (6 ml\/kg ideal bodyweight) and avoidance of high inspiratory pressures (P plat < 30) to minimize the risk of volutrauma 33 Reduced oxygenation targets (SaO 2 88e95%; pO 2 7.5e10.5) e 'permissive hypoxia' Acceptance of mildemoderate respiratory acidosis e 'permissive hypercapnia' Greater use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), particularly in more severe hypoxaemia 35 (NB: PEEP should be used cautiously and may be contraindicated in obstructive airways disease) Early use of neuromuscular blockade in severe cases 36 General strategies Avoidance of excessive fluid administration Minimizing sedation once acute insult has settled e daily sedation holds (interruption of sedation), use of sedation scores 37 Daily trials of spontaneous breathing and protocolized weaning once initial insult has resolved 38 Early and appropriate nutritional support Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis Stress ulcer prophylaxis More recently, attention has turned to the use of extracorporeal support in patients with extreme gas exchange abnormalities. In the recent CESAR study, 39 transfer to a centre capable of delivering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was associated with improved outcome (death or disability) at 6 months. This study and the high-profile success of ECMO in the H1N1 40 influenza pandemic has resulted in a resurgence of interest in this technique. Simpler forms of extracorporeal support exist where hypercapnia is the predominant problem. 41 The development of these and other specialist techniques, along with a recognized volumeeoutcome relationship for mechanical ventilation, 42 has promoted the concept of advanced respiratory support centres to manage the sickest patients.\r\n Longer term, there is an increased recognition that survivors of critical illness can be left with significant physical, mental and psychological sequelae 43 and early rehabilitation and ICU followup programmes have evolved to address these issues.","sha":"c4028a2dae5a30782d0b311ab1003c95310af33c","publish_time":"2012-06-30","authors":"Popat, Bhavesh; Jones, Andrew T.","journal":"Medicine","doi":"10.1016\/j.mpmed.2012.03.010","Title":"Medicine","H index":135.0,"transmission_indicator":true,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"Indications for ventilation Early identification of critically ill patients, before the occurrence of significant cardio-respiratory decompensation, is one of the major goals of critical care outreach programmes. The modern ventilator is a complex computer-driven tool and a detailed description of its modes and use are beyond the scope of this article (see Further reading). In simple terms, it mixes air under pressure with variable oxygen concentrations to provide inspiration and expiration, each 'breath' is characterized by three factors, which can be adjusted by the operator; Trigger: the ventilator can deliver a breath according to a timer that defines a specific set rate (ventilator initiated\/ mandatory breaths), or as a result of the patient's own breathing efforts effecting a change in the pressure or flow in the ventilator circuit (patient-initiated\/spontaneous breaths). 2 Indeed, for some situations it is considered the first-choice mode of ventilatory support ( NIV today consists almost exclusively of the delivery of positive pressure ventilation via an external interface. NIV can be delivered using most modern 'intensive care' ventilators. Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure Patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory acidosis secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), represent the most extensively studied group, and the greatest evidence for benefit exists in COPD. 4 This does not preclude the use of NIV in patients with more severe respiratory failure, 8e10 and a pH as low as 7.20 may still be compatible with favourable outcomes. However, such patients should be managed in a high-dependency environment, to allow for rapid escalation to intubation and invasive ventilation if appropriate. 14e17 Several meta-analyses have established benefit, including decreased intubation rate (CPAP\/ bi-level) and mortality (CPAP) compared to standard medical therapy. The low rate of intubation (<3%), and the potential for crossover between the study arms may have limited the ability to document improvements with NIV. There is conflicting evidence for the use of NIV in hypoxaemic respiratory failure. In an attempt to limit exposure to the risks of invasive mechanical ventilation, NIV is being used increasingly to promote earlier extubation and prevent re-intubation. 28 \r\n With increasing expertize in its use, it is not surprising that clinicians have been keen to exploit the potential benefits of NIV over invasive ventilation in other 29, 30 forms of respiratory compromise (Table 1) . It is important to recognize that in some conditions the literature represents small series from experienced centres and the importance of the environment and forward planning cannot be overemphasized. Large multinational surveys confirm the common indications for invasive ventilation to be: 2 coma 16% COPD 13% ARDS 11% heart failure 11% pneumonia 11% sepsis 11% trauma 11% postoperative complications 11% neuromuscular disorders 5%. Such consequences need to be anticipated: large-volume cannulae should be in place; access to plasma expanders and inotropes should be immediately available; and following induction of anaesthesia the airway must be rapidly secured by an experienced member of the critical care team e ideally in an appropriately equipped area of the hospital. 31, 32 The landmark NIH ARDS network trial 33 confirmed that in patients with acute lung injury, the use of a reduced tidal volume (6 ml\/kg) and avoidance of high airway pressures (<30 cmH 2 O) were associated with improved mortality (31% vs. 39.8% (NNTz11)) when compared with a conventional ventilatory approach."},{"Unnamed: 0":98,"Unnamed: 0.1":98,"doc_id":"6a9a59c5cdaf90c49178a97e70859f8c0436216b","title":"The history of respiratory disease management","abstract":"Over the past 200 years lung diseases have shifted from infections e tuberculosis, pneumonia e to diseases of dirty air e chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and lung cancer.

Of course, it had never really left at all, surging on among the malnourished and overcrowded in poorer countries. Drug-resistant bacteria emerged and TB deaths rose again. Pneumonia, too, had never gone away. Osler in the 1920s named it the 'old man's friend ' \r\n In 1850, eyes, hands, nose and ears e minimally aided by a stethoscope e were all the doctor had. He could see pallor, cyanosis or a flapping tremor but did not understand them. He could feel chest movements and tap out different tones with elegant percussive fingers but had no idea of what was going on inside. He could smell anaerobes (new-mown hay with an arri ere gout of stale faeces), and he could wield a stethoscope as an instrument of erudition rather than understanding. His drug treatments were herbs e poppy, willow bark, stramonium, wormwood e and his surgical skills were few. TB was treated with rest, varying diets and lifestyle changes. Love and sex in particular had to be avoided e difficult as in sanatoria there was little else to do. Acute infections and fevers were cupped, bled or scarified, partly in order to remove bad humours and partly to structure time while waiting for nature to kill or cure. Did the doctor do more harm than good? No one knew. Then came the age of scientific discovery. Three key advances were Pasteur's germ theory of disease, Roentgen's discovery of X-rays and Chadwick's linking of infection to poor living conditions. Pasteur used microscopy (microbes could be seen and classified) to explain diseases, Semmelweis insisted on hygiene e puerperal fever could be prevented by clean hands e John Snow mapped the epidemiology of cholera to a water tap, and Lister sprayed antiseptic. At least as important as any technical advance, although less glamorous, was Edwin Chadwick's report The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population (1842), leading to new public health laws. Study of lung physiology led to tests of function e Hutchinson's 1842 spirometer was the pathfinder.\r\n The 20th century saw a cascade of scientific discoveries, but much more important was development and application of the earlier discoveries. Microbiologists gave us precise diagnosis and the tools to develop vaccines and antibiotics. Radiologists showed what was really going on, culminating in computed tomography scanning (1970), with its ever-greater resolution rivalling histopathology (Figure 1 ). Public health improved with housing laws, school meals, free milk, mass mini X-ray vans and programmes of vaccination.\r\n Lung function testing developed more slowly, taking 100 years to move from Hutchison's lung volumes to Tiffeneau's flow rates. This was followed by a major academic push in the 1950s to understand gas exchange, with attempts to make carbon monoxide transfer and body plethysmography clinically useful. More important, however, were blood gas measurements. Today spirometry is encouraged in primary care, with occasional benefits over peak flow meters, but simple oximeters have become an essential tool of lung medicine.\r\n Endoscopy took off slowly from the first laryngoscopy in 1849 to rigid bronchoscopy (1904), toughed out with either no anaesthesia at all or, for wimps, cocaine spray. All changed in the 1970s with Japanese fibreoptics; by 1980 diagnostic bronchoscopy was being carried out by physicians, not surgeons.\r\n Science and luck precede new treatments by 10e50 years. The three main types e drugs, devices and surgery e hit the healthcare market in completely different ways. New drugs get the most attention as they are launched with a fanfare, they can be prescribed as soon as they are approved, and all doctors can use them. Patients report instant improvement and the makers make money. Device development is slower but at least as important. Specialists start to use them and slowly the word goes round. Slower still and much more invisible to patients and primary care are advances in surgery.\r\n Three out of thousands of new chemical drugs revolutionized lung treatment. Antibiotics came first and deserve first prize. Synthetic sulfonamides in the 1930s were toxic and unsuitable for systemic use. Moulds had been used to treat infections for centuries before Fleming investigated penicillin in 1928 (Poland, France, Italy, Belgium and Costa Rica can all claim to have got there first); Florey and Pfizer were essential in taking it on to manufacture in 1942. Then came streptomycin (1944), tetracycline (1945), chloramphenicol (1947), erythromycin (1949), isoniazid (1952) and rifampicin (1957) . The transition from watching an infection to treating it was dramatic, and it must have been a wonderful era to be a doctor.\r\n Close behind came the miracle of cortisone. In 1949, patients with rheumatoid arthritis picked up their beds and walked, and the wonder drug began to cure all known diseases; recreational use led to cortisone parties in New York. By 1955, the benefits and adverse effects had been quickly established clinical observation e controlled trials take longer. Asthma attacks responded to treatment, and with inhaled corticosteroids came long-term control. Third prize goes to the b-adrenoceptor agonists, first isoprenaline, then salbutamol and finally the long-acting badrenoceptor agonists. Selective b 2 -adrenoceptor agonists are among the world's best-selling drugs for asthma, COPD, sporting performance and beef production.\r\n Again, there are hundreds of these. Some assist ventilation, some get drugs in or mucus out, but two types dominate the field: ventilators and inhalers. The simplest positive-pressure support devices, bag and mask, work but endotracheal tube and intensive care are better. Drinker's iron lungs (1927) countered respiratory paralysis from polio, other negative-pressure devices e turtles, ponchos and cuirasses e being less effective. In the 1980s, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation took off, and devices have been improving ever since (Figure 2 ), keeping hundreds of thousands of people alive who would, 100 years ago, have died. Linked to this are oxygen delivery devices; cylinders, liquid oxygen reservoirs and cumbersome concentrators have been replaced by neat portable versions weighing <2 kg.\r\n Old inhalers were inefficient: steam with pleasant-smelling herbs is soothing and still enjoyed today but delivers little to the lungs. Nebulizers started in the 1870s with a squeeze-bulb version, but the particle size needed for penetration into the lungs was not understood until the 1950s. The first efficient metered dose inhaler, based on perfume spray technology, was launched in 1955 and has lasted well. Dry powder inhaler research started in 1930s; the Aerohaler\u00d2 (1949) did not work, the Rotahaler\u00d2 (1960s) and Spinhaler\u00d2 (1970s) worked to some degree, but the 1990s Turbohaler and Diskhaler were good and there are now >30 different versions. Big pharma did all the research as it was rather too hum-drum for academia.\r\n It takes many small steps to climb a mountain. Key steps were endotracheal intubation (1904), anaesthetic gases (chloroform 1847, halothane 1951), antisepsis (1870s), blood groups and safe transfusion (1901), antibiotics (1940s) and, most important of all, brave pioneers. Each new operation builds on the experience of others; artificial pneumothorax (1830s) moved on to thoracoplasty (1880s) and plombage (1920s). The first survival from pneumonectomy was in 1931; the next 16 patients died. Eventually, surgery for TB turned into lung cancer resection in the 1950s. Drainage of pleural fluid was routine from 1850 (Axel Munthe describes draining an empyema in a pet ape during a home visit in The Story of San Michele in 1929). Thoracoscopy started in 1910 and advanced in the 1970s with fibreoptics. It has since developed into video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for investigation of pleural disease, lung biopsy, treatment of pneumothorax and simple resections. Lung transplantation opened new and wonderful prospects for end-stage lung disease with the first successful operations in the 1970s, and has now become routine, albeit limited by scarcity of donor organs.\r\n Thoracic surgery led on to heart surgery, and by the 1960s there was a danger that lung surgery would be left behind. However, in the 1970s, lung surgery developed separately and has flourished. Organizational change can be as important as technical.\r\n Delivery of care Lung medicine was a major part of the general doctor's workload in the 19th century until the 1850s sanatorium movement e well described by Thomas Mann in The Magic Mountain and AE Ellis in The Rack e and this specialization led to chest clinics. These were alongside but separate from hospitals and endured professional snobbery. General physicians looked down on chest physicians ('Chest e yes, physician e never') before the systems were integrated in the 1960s. Today, the lung specialist is often the best general physician. TB nurses morphed, after a brief spell in the wilderness, into respiratory nurses with their own training programmes. Some work in primary care and some are specialist nurses in hospitals and have been joined by respiratory therapists, specialist physiotherapists, lung function measurers, psychologists and the rest. The room can now be very full as a single patient faces hoards of multidisciplinary professionals sharing out the management.\r\n In spite of all this change, lung disease, a major killer 150 years ago, remains a major killer today.","sha":"6a9a59c5cdaf90c49178a97e70859f8c0436216b","publish_time":"2020-03-04","authors":"Geddes, Duncan","journal":"Medicine","doi":"10.1016\/j.mpmed.2020.01.007","Title":"Medicine","H index":135.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"The lungs are the most exposed of the internal organs and have throughout the past 200 years occupied centre stage for disability and death.

These were alongside but separate from hospitals and endured professional snobbery. General physicians looked down on chest physicians ('Chest e yes, physician e never') before the systems were integrated in the 1960s. Today, the lung specialist is often the best general physician. TB nurses morphed, after a brief spell in the wilderness, into respiratory nurses with their own training programmes. Some work in primary care and some are specialist nurses in hospitals and have been joined by respiratory therapists, specialist physiotherapists, lung function measurers, psychologists and the rest. The room can now be very full as a single patient faces hoards of multi-disciplinary professionals sharing out the management.\r\n In spite of all this change lung disease, a major killer 150 years ago, remains a major killer today.","sha":"0f2034abef37f683452c548e0878d5b6316a46ef","publish_time":"2016-06-30","authors":"Geddes, Duncan","journal":"Medicine","doi":"10.1016\/j.mpmed.2016.03.006","Title":"Medicine","H index":135.0,"transmission_indicator":false,"smoke_indicator":true,"scibert_summary":"The lungs are the most exposed of the internal organs and throughout the past 150 years have occupied centre stage for disability and death. We understand these breathing bags better than ever before, we can see into them in ways unimagined in the 19th century and we have a growing armamentarium to fight their disorders. Change is sometimes real and sometimes where the spotlight falls. Lung diseases surge and sometimes seem to go. And then these two captains of the men of death drifted away. Antibiotics cured them and left the theatre empty for the diseases of dirty air. And then, just as the audience was beginning to forget them, came the triumphal re-entry of the infections. He was President of the British Thoracic Society and Chairman of Asthma UK. elegant percussive fingers but had no idea of what was going on inside. Love and sex in particular had to be avoided e difficult as in sanatoria there was little else to do. Today spirometry is encouraged in primary care, with occasional benefits over peak flow meters, but simple oximeters have become an essential tool of lung medicine. All changed in 1972 with Japanese fibreoptics; by 1980, diagnostic bronchoscopy was being carried out by physicians, not surgeons. Science and luck precede new treatments by 10e50 years. Patients report instant improvement and the makers make money. Device development is slower but at least as important. Antibiotics came first and deserve first prize. Moulds had been used to treat infections for centuries before Fleming investigated penicillin in 1928 (Poland, France, Italy, Belgium and Costa Rica can all claim to have got there first); Florey and Pfizer were essential in taking it on to manufacture in 1942. Drinker's iron lungs (1927) countered respiratory paralysis from polio, other negativepressure devices e turtles, ponchos and cuirasses e being less effective. It takes many small steps to climb a mountain. Key were endotracheal intubation (1904), anaesthetic gases (chloroform 1847, halothane 1951), antisepsis (1870s), blood groups and safe transfusion (1901), antibiotics (1940s) and, most important of all, brave pioneers.
