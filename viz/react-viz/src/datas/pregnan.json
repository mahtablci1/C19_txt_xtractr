Early identification of COVID-19 is important for the patients as well as the healthy population. Currently, the patients should be isolated for treatment from the healthy people for controlling the epidemic. It has been reported that chest CT is superior to RT-PCR in sensitivity for early detection of COVID-19. 22 Based on the epidemiological characteristics, clinically-diagnosed cases with typical CT features were treated with the same therapy in Hubei Province to offset the effects of possible false negative of the new coronavirus nucleic acid tests. 13 In our study, 44% and 36% pregnant women presented initial onset of fever in either laboratory-confirmed or clinicallydiagnosed group, which was less common than 87.9% in the nonpregnant population in the study by Guan et al. 11 and consistent with the previous study enrolling 9 pregnant women with COVID-19. 17 Currently, fever served as the basic screening flag in China. Absence of typical symptoms increased the difficulty of the surveillance in the pregnant population. Furthermore, the physiological findings about leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio due to adaptations to gestation could further complicate the situation. Nevertheless, no pregnant women were admitted to ICU. Compared with the previous studies, 11 it may be one of the reasons there were more cases of pregnant women categorized as mild or common type in clinical context. As with unenhanced chest CT imaging of pregnant women during the epidemic in Wuhan, low dose technique was implemented with the DLP ranging from 50 to 150 mGy cm for diagnostic imaging in our study, which was safe for the fetuses. 23 Sixteen pregnant women were performed with post-partum CT in our study. As with the CT features associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, the common characteristics in the pregnant group included pure GGO, GGO with consolidation or reticulation, and complete consolidation with predominantly peripheral distribution and bilateral lung involvement, which were similar to those of the non-pregnant group in our research as reported in the previous studies. 19 , 20 , 24 There were overlaps in imaging findings between COVID-19 and other viral infections, such as the coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pneumonia, as well as H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 infections. 19 , 20 The patterns of GGOs or GGO with the above features in predominantly peripheral distribution will facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. 20 The above imaging findings could be mostly explained by a recently published research on the pathological investigation of COVID-19. 25 Diffuse alveolar injury superimposed with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and hyaline membrane formation was identified on pathology. Other findings included pulmonary edema and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates (dominated by lymphocytes). Therefore, we have the GGOs, consolidations, and reticulations which indicate fibromyxoid exudates, the interstitial edema and the lymphocytes infiltrate resulting in the lymphopenia inside the blood. The more common consolidation and relatively higher TSS in the laboratoryconfirmed and clinically-diagnosed pregnant women suggested the more severity in pregnant women, except for three laboratoryconfirmed pregnant women showing no abnormalities related with COVID-19 pneumonia at CT. Therefore, there is no doubt that the CT study did a big favor in structuring the clinical treatment strategy for the pregnant women as we hoped. Fortunately, the infants were all normal without any evidence of vertical transmission from women with COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy, which was consistent with the prior research by Chen et al. 16 While compared between the two pregnant groups, the consolidation were more frequent in the clinically-diagnosed group with a relatively higher TSS of 4 \u00b78 (SD 3 \u00b75), indicating relatively more severe lung involvement resulting from delayed treatment prior to a laboratory confirmation. Cases with initial negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 but high clinical suspicion were also reported in previous studies, and the SARS-CoV-2 was positive after repeated tests. 12 , 13 For the clinically-diagnosed patients, it is speculated that samples from the lower respiratory tract via lavage and repeat tests may be helpful to rule out the false negative results. Fortunately, the laboratory-negative cases with typical imaging findings were supposed to receive the same treatment protocol as the positive ones in China. Pleural effusion was identified in 6\/16 (38%) and 6\/25 (24%) patients in the laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed pregnant groups, which was more than that in the study by Song et al. 20 This phenomenon could be attributed to a common finding within 1-24 h of normal delivery. 26 Compared with adults, fewer children are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Nine children younger than 14 years out of 1011 patients were reported by Guan et al. 11 Our study revealed that the non-specific abnormalities (pure GGO or consolidation) distributed without peripheral predominance at CT unlike the adults. However, when superimposed with other pathogen infections, the pulmonary involvement was more severe, as simultaneous infection of RSV and SARS-CoV-2 in one child was detected in our study. Nevertheless, it was difficult to distinguish if the consolidation was associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, since the consolidation and pleural effusion were also common in pure RSV infection. 27 The contact history and clinical symptoms of fever or cough may be helpful for the surveillance.","risk_factor":["age","blood","liver","lung","lung","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","child","child","child","tb"],"design":[],"rank":27.8,"doi":"10.1016\/j.jinf.2020.03.007","abstract":"Abstract Background The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia is globally concerning.

Approximately 25 percent of pregnant women who develop pneumonia will need to be hospitalized in critical care units and require ventilatory support [16] . Although bacterial pneumonia is a serious disease when it occurs in pregnant women, even when the agent(s) are susceptible to antibiotics, viral pneumonia has even higher levels of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy [18] . As with other infectious diseases, the normal maternal physiologic changes that accompany pregnancy-including altered cell-mediated immunity [19] and changes in pulmonary function-have been hypothesized to affect both susceptibility to and clinical severity of pneumonia [20] [21] [22] . This has been evident historically during previous epidemics. The case fatality rate (CFR) for pregnant women infected with influenza during the 1918-1919 pandemic was 27%-even higher when exposure occurred during the 3rd trimester and upwards of 50% if pneumonia supervened [23] . During the 1957-1958 Asian flu epidemic, 10% of all deaths occurred in pregnant women, and their CFR was twice as high as that of infected women who were not pregnant [24] .

It is certain that 2019-nCoV will infect women who are pregnant, leaving the question open as to whether the novel coronavirus will have a similar or different effect on them compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

GGO with reticulation was less common in 9\/161 (6%) and 16\/322 (5%) lesions for the two pregnant groups than 24\/131 (18%) for the non-pregnant adults (P = 0\u00b7001, P < 0\u00b7001). The pulmonary involvement in children with COVID-19 was mild with a focal GGO or consolidation. Twenty-three patients underwent follow-up CT, revealing progression in 9\/13 (69%) at 3 days whereas improvement in 8\/10 (80%) at 6\u20139 days after initial CT scans. Interpretation Atypical clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 could increase the difficulty in initial identification. Consolidation was more common in the pregnant groups. The clinically-diagnosed cases were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement. CT was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and timely therapeutic effects evaluation for the cases with epidemic and clinical features of COVID-19 with or without laboratory confirmation. The exposure history and clinical symptoms were more helpful for screening in children versus chest CT.","publish_time":"2020-03-21","authors":"Liu, Huanhuan; Liu, Fang; Li, Jinning; Zhang, Tingting; Wang, Dengbin; Lan, Weishun","journal":"Journal of Infection","text_body":"custom_license"},{"doc_id":"779c1b5cb3afe3d50219aa2af791014a22eb355a","title":"viruses Perspective Potential Maternal and Infant Outcomes from Coronavirus 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus Infections","relevant_section":"There is limited knowledge regarding coronavirus infections that occur during pregnancy-what is known has, for the most part, been the result of epidemics resulting from two different diseases, SARS and MERS. These previous experiences with coronavirus infections in pregnancy indicates that these agents are capable of causing adverse clinical outcomes including life-threatening maternal disease that in some cases requires hospitalization, intensive care and ventilatory support. Both of these coronaviruses can result in maternal death in a small but significant number of cases, but the specific risk factors for a fatal outcome during pregnancy have not been clarified. Coronaviruses can also result in adverse outcomes for the fetus and infant including intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, admission to the ICU, spontaneous abortion and perinatal death. Unlike some viral infections, notably Ebola virus [70] and Zika virus [80] , the likelihood of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission of coronaviruses is low-there have been no documented cases of vertical transmission occurring with either SARS or MERS. It remains to be seen during the current Wuhan 2019-nCoV epidemic how this newly-emergent coronavirus affects pregnant women and their infants, as well as which factors may modulate obstetrical disease and outcomes including the timing of maternal coronavirus exposure by gestational age, the effects of medications or other treatment regimens, differences in host immune responses, occurrence of coexisting medical and obstetrical conditions, and other covariables. However, pregnant women should be considered to be at high risk for developing severe infection during this current outbreak of 2019-nCoV. Additional clinical research on the treatment of SARS, MERS, and the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV is necessary if we are to understand the potential risks and benefits of novel therapies and new vaccines in pregnancy. This research will be critical in improving the care, and even saving the lives, of pregnant women in the current as well as future outbreaks.","risk_factor":["age","age","liver","immun","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","tb","tb"],"design":[],"rank":18.1,"doi":"10.3390\/v12020194","abstract":"In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China.

Of these, 5 patients were pregnant, according to a retrospective study by Assiri et al. [47] , and all resulted in adverse outcomes. Patient ages ranged from 27 to 34 years, with occurrence of exposure in either the 2nd or 3rd trimester. All 5 cases received intensive care. Two women died and there were 2 cases of perinatal death-1 stillbirth and 1 neonatal death shortly after emergency cesarean section. These instances of severe maternal and perinatal outcomes are consistent with other reports of MERS-CoV infection in pregnant women, as well as outcomes associated with SARS-CoV infection. The authors of the retrospectives study concede that unreported cases of MERS in pregnancy are likely due to lack of routine pregnancy testing [47] . They conclude that pregnancy testing for women of reproductive age should be considered for those who test positive for MERS-CoV, to contribute to overall understanding of pathogenesis and epidemiological risk. Additionally, 2 of the 5 patients were healthcare workers, which corresponds with existing knowledge of higher risk of exposure to MERS-CoV in healthcare settings.","risk_factor":["age","age","neonat","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan"],"design":["retrospective study"],"rank":18.0,"doi":"10.3390\/v12020194","abstract":"In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China.

As of the PHEIC declaration, 12 groups have announced that they are developing new vaccines against 2019-nCoV and seven others announced initiatives to develop new therapies [74] . Safe testing of experimental vaccines in a pregnant population is difficult and, as a result, vaccines are not typically developed with pregnant women in mind. To date, very few clinical trials for vaccines have proactively included pregnant women [75] , and the exclusion of pregnant and lactating women from receiving the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine through 3 Ebola virus epidemics serves as a recent example [69] [70] [71] . Given the potential severity in pregnancy, as demonstrated by this review of maternal infections of SARS and MERS, women who are pregnant should be considered a priority population in all efforts to prepare for and prevent infection by novel coronaviruses.","risk_factor":["age","immun","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan","pregnan"],"design":[],"rank":17.3,"doi":"10.3390\/v12020194","abstract":"In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China.
