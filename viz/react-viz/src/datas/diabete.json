The name refers to the morphology of the virus, when viewed under 2D transmission electron microscopy (large pleomorphic spherical particles with bulbous surface) and stems from the Latin word \"corona\", meaning \"crown\" (Goldsmith et al., 2004 5 ) . Concerning the risk factor, HCoVs vary significantly; from the relatively harmless ones (i.e., common cold) to the most lethal ones (MERS-CoV, with more than 30% mortality rate in the infected) (Fehr & Perlman, 2015 6 ). CoVs spread during cold seasons and cause colds with major symptoms, i.e., fever, sore throat, and less commonly pneumonia and bronchitis for the more aggressive strains. To date, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs capable of preventing or treating HCoV infections (Fehr & To date, several outbreaks of coronavirus-related diseases have been reported. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-or SARS was the first coronavirus-related outbreak, starting in Guangdong, China, in November 2002, and spread to a total of 29 territories, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States, within 9 months. It infected a total of 8,098 people and killed 774 worldwide (Smith, 2006 9 ). The second coronavirus-related outbreak happened in the Middle East in April 2012, officially named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS. This virus was first identified in a patient from Saudi Arabia, and later, MERS affected several other countries, including Saudi Arabia, South Korea, United Arab Emirate, Jordan, Qatar, and Oman. Overall resulting with infections in 24 countries, with over 1,000 cases and over 400 deaths (Organization 10 ). The outbreak of MERS happened again in South Korea, supposedly from a traveler from Middle East. It happened during May and July 2015, and infected a total of 186 individuals, with a death toll of 36 (Organization, 2015 11 ). After 3 years in August 2018, the next MERS outbreak happened in countries on the Arabian Peninsula, and resulted in almost 147 infected people and the death of 47. The MERS outbreak had been reported in Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, and South Korea. In Dec 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China, and on Dec 31, it was attributed to a new strain of HCoV, first named as 2019-nCoV by World Health Organization (WHO), and later renamed to SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Almost 2 weeks later, on Jan. 11, 2020, Chinese state media reported the first fatality from the new discovered virus, that led to infection of dozens more. As of Jan 20, multiple countries reported their first cases, including Japan, South Korea and Thailand. The first confirmed case in the United States came the very next day in Washington State. Continuing its spread, Coronavirus presence was confirmed throughout the month of February in the Philippines (Feb 2), France (Feb 14), Iran (Feb 21), and as reports started in Italy on Feb 23; many more Europeans countries followed suit, reporting their first confirmed cases. As of this writing, the coronavirus has affected 115 countries, out of more than 118,000 confirmed cases, around 4,000 people have lost their lives. With China, Italy, Iran, and South Korea experiencing the worst cases of outbreaks and showing no sign of alleviation, the 2019-2020 outbreak of COVID-19 is now officially recognized as a pandemic by WHO. An outbreak or epidemic often refers to a sudden increase in the occurrence of an infectious disease, in a particular time and place. Pandemics are near-global epidemic outbreaks, where multiple countries across the world are involved (Green et al., 2002 12 ). The mentioned rapid trend of spread prompts a lot of concerns and questions such as; \"How fast is the virus spreading?\", \"which policies or efforts could control the disease better?\", and \"what is the main difference of COVID-19 outbreak with pervious epidemics?\" Fortunately, the daily case detection changes are available and can be tracked almost in real time on the website provided by authors (http:\/\/iuwa.ir\/corona\/). The aim of this study is to provide the transmission trend from China to other countries and to report the daily confirmed cases, case fatalities and surveillance in every countries from the first day of outbreak until March 4th. Also, to evaluate the effect of each government policies in controlling the outbreak of COVID-19.","risk_factor":[],"design":["outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak"],"rank":29.7,"doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.15.20036418","abstract":"The 2019-Novel-Coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected 115 countries and out of more than 118,000 confirmed cases.

Methods We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95%CI).

The clinical spectrum of COVID\u221219 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID\u221219 severity. Method This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID\u221219 infection or ICU admission. Results Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID\u221219 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 \u2212 7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28 \u2212 10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44 \u2212 16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 \u2212 48.2). Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 \u2212 7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 \u2212 5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity. Conclusions Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness.

Notwithstanding these small series, a report of 72,314 cases of COVID-19 published by Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention showed increased mortality in people with diabetes (2.3%, overall and 7.3%, patients with diabetes) [12] .","risk_factor":["diabete","diabete","diabete","diabete","diabete","diabete","diabete","diabete","diabete","age","blood"],"design":[],"rank":19.8,"doi":"10.1016\/j.dsx.2020.03.002","abstract":null,"publish_time":"2020-06-30","authors":"Gupta, Ritesh; Ghosh, Amerta; Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Misra, Anoop","journal":"Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews","text_body":"custom_license"},{"doc_id":"3af55110dc6a758897baf6783d8a8263f71240aa","title":"Journal Pre-proof COVID-19 Computed Tomography Findings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis COVID-19 Computed Tomography Findings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Title: COVID-19 Computed Tomography Findings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","relevant_section":"\u2022 Our systematic review and meta-analysis of the early literature suggests that the proportion of suspected COVID-19 detected by chest CT imaging is high.","risk_factor":[],"design":["systematic review ","analysi","meta-analysis"],"rank":19.0,"doi":"10.1016\/j.jacr.2020.03.006","abstract":"Abstract Purpose To date, there remain considerable knowledge gaps regarding the chest CT imaging features of COVID-19. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantitatively summarize results from published studies to date to provide a summary of evidence on detection of COVID-19 by chest CT and the expected CT imaging manifestations. Methods Studies were identi\ufb01ed by searching PubMed database for articles published December 2019 \u2013 February 2020. Pooled CT positive rate of COVID-19 and pooled incidence of CT imaging findings were estimated using a random-effect model. Results A total of 13 studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled positive rate of the CT imaging was 89.76% and 90.35% when only including thin-section chest CT. Typical CT signs were ground glass opacities (GGO) (83.31%), GGO with mixed consolidation (58.42%), adjacent pleura thickening (52.46%), interlobular septal thickening (48.46%), and air bronchograms (46.46%). Other CT signs included crazy paving pattern (14.81%), pleural effusion (5.88%), bronchiectasis (5.42%), pericardial effusion (4.55%) and lymphadenopathy (3.38%). The most anatomic distributions were bilateral lung infection (78.2%) and peripheral distribution (76.95%). The incidences were highest in the right lower lobe (87.21%), left lower lobe (81.41%), and bilateral lower lobes (65.22%). The right upper lobe (65.22%), right middle lobe (54.95%) and left upper lobe (69.43%) were also commonly involved. The incidence of bilateral upper lobes was 60.87%. A considerable proportion of patients had 3 or more lobes involved (70.81%). Conclusions The detection of COVID-19 chest CT imaging is very high among symptomatic individuals at high risk, especially using thin-section chest CT. The most common CT features in patients affected by COVID-19 included GGO and consolidation involving the bilateral lungs in a peripheral distribution.","publish_time":"2020-03-25","authors":"Bao, Cuiping; Liu, Xuehuan; Zhang, Han; Li, Yiming; Liu, Jun","journal":"Journal of the American College of Radiology","text_body":"custom_license"},{"doc_id":"6f8725026d83e6829275eefc91aef6fbdacc9c06","title":"Journal Pre-proof Commentary: COVID-19 in Patients with Diabetes Commentary: COVID-19 in Patients with Diabetes. Journal Pre-proof","relevant_section":"In summary, it is apparent that persons with diabetes are at increased risk for COVID-19 infection, and are at increased risk for medical complications including death. This necessitates increased vigilance and testing in outpatient diabetes and general medicine clinics for COVID-19 and a lower threshold for hospitalization of these patients. In this regard, an unreported disturbing observation by the authors is that an increasing number of diabetic patients are cancelling their routine visits to diabetes clinics. This development along with the increased stress associated with social isolation and lack of physical activity provides a fertile ground for worsening glycemic and blood pressure control, further predisposing these vulnerable patients to COVID-19 infections. As suggested by the ADA and AACE it is imperative that we alert the health care community and the public regarding the increased risks of this progressing pandemic in diabetic patients. Also, as suggested by these Societies adherence to CDC guidance J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f regarding social isolation is vey important in persons with diabetes. Finally, the current situation emphasizes the need for more clinical investigation as the pandemic unfolds to fully characterize the problem and define best practices for optimum outcomes.","risk_factor":["diabete","diabete","diabete","diabete","blood"],"design":["investig","investigati"],"rank":18.6,"doi":"10.1016\/j.metabol.2020.154217","abstract":null,"publish_time":"2020-03-24","authors":"Hill, Michael A.; Mantzoros, Christos; Sowers, James R.","journal":"Metabolism","text_body":"custom_license"}]
