In Europe, Italy has faced this novel disease entity (named COVID-19) first and severely. COVID-19 represents a significant hurdle for public health services and a potential harm for patients with cancer. The Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis. In the midst of the epidemic in Italy, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of oncologists and the implementation of containment measures of COVID-19 diffusion. Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory. Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented through the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits, and use of telemedicine. Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology departments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency. Oncologists need to preserve the continuum of care of patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection. International cooperation is an important starting point, as heavily affected\n nations can serve as an example to find out ways to safely preserve health activity during pandemic.\n We thank all the CIPOMO members for participating in the present survey, thereby making this work possible to be shared in the oncologists' community.\n Fundings: no funding was obtained for the present investigation.","text_body":"The survey includes a total of 27 questions, which are divided in 3 sections: the first section assesses the routine use of preventive measures (e.g. vaccinations) in oncologic patients; the second contains questions regarding COVID-19 diffusion containment measures adopted before the enactment of national decrees in this regard; the third and last section assesses the diffusion of COVID-19 in oncology units and its impact on working activity, after national decrees on containment measures were adopted. A complete original version of the survey is provided in Supplementary Material 1.\nThe survey was launched online on March 12 th 2020, and closed on March 15 th 2020. Figure 1 Results of Section 1 show that the overall tendency throughout Italy is to perform preventive vaccination in oncologic patients ( Table 2 ). Most vaccinated patients are either receiving active systemic treatment (chemotherapy, immune-therapy, and hormonal or targeted therapy), and\/or present one or more predisposing risk factors (i.e. age \u2265 75 years, cardiovascular and\/or respiratory disease, chronic infections, diabetes, obesity, immune-suppressive therapies). The most widely adopted vaccination is for seasonal flu, however more than 30% of oncologists suggests also performing pneumococcal vaccination in those patients. Seasonal flu cases are not usually reported by medical oncologists to the dedicated national registry, rather this is commonly a duty of family doctors.\nAnswers to the questions in Section 2 clearly show that, even if by the time of the survey COVID-19 represented an emergency mainly in the North of Italy, diagnostic measures for all patients accessing oncologic services were immediately activated in the whole country ( Table 3) .\nTriage of patients included vital signs monitoring before entering the hospital (body temperature, SpO2, respiratory rate), but also questioning patients on the presence of symptoms during the 15 days before the visit, and possible contacts with subjects affected by COVID-19 or coming from high-risk areas. In more than 65% of cases, triage procedure was followed by preventive isolation and diagnostic work up of symptomatic patients, consisting in chest X-ray and rhino-pharyngeal swab to rule out the presence of SARSCoV-2.\nAfter the very first reports of COVID-19 in Italy, measures to reduce hospital accesses for oncologic patients were taken almost throughout the country. Such measures consisted mainly in delaying visits not considered to be urgent (i.e. patients in follow up after surgery and\/or radiotherapy, and\/or patients with breast cancer receiving adjuvant hormonal treatment after surgery), even more so if the patients presented risk factors (i.e. age > 85 years, presence of comorbidities). Alternative ways to get in touch with patients have been widely used: most patients underwent telephonic interviews with interpretation of laboratory and radiologic exams report, while in other cases family doctors were delegated to inspect the results of follow up exams. Access to oncologic structures was likewise limited and\/or denied for visitors and caregivers, either for outpatient visits, day hospital and ward admissions.\nWith the enactment of the decree on March 9 th and subsequent decree on March 11 th , containment preventive measures became effective in the Red Zone before, and on the whole Italian territory thereafter. However, by that time most oncologic units had already activated measures to contain accesses, under regional or internal (hospital Medical Direction) orders. As so, more than 50% of oncologic structures did not have to modify the measures they implemented to reduce the risk of infections, in view of the actual legislation. Due to such measures, more than 20% of structures had reported a significant reduction in their routine activity, while 60% had only a negligible reduction and 9% had not substantially changed their activity.\nAnswers to the questions in Section 3 show that almost one third of oncologic structures had to employ their oncologists for guard duties in Internal Medicine ward and\/or Emergency Department; in 23% of cases, guard duties in COVID ward were included (Table 4 ). This percentage was understandably higher in the North of the Country, reaching 51% and 38% of oncologists employed for Internal Medicine\/Emergency Department and COVID wards guard duties, respectively, in the Red Zone. Twenty-four percent of Italian oncology departments had at least one patient diagnosed with COVID-19, with a higher rate in the Red Zone (46%) and no diagnosis at all in the South of Italy and in islands. Examining reports from the Red Zone, it emerges that most patients accessed Emergency Room presenting with fever and\/or respiratory symptoms (23%), while a significant proportion of patients was diagnosed after a triage procedure (18%) and\/or a medical interview regarding possible contacts with subjects at risk (18%).

Little is known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19.\n Methods We retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0-16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China. We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features.\n were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB. All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir-ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation. Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days. By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured.\n Interpretation Although all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community-acquired infections.","text_body":"White blood cells ( unclear routes of transmission, were identified. This transmission feature means that identification of these paediatric patients was straightforward. However, previous work has shown that potential transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 can be highly variable, 20 compared with MERS coronavirus, which is less transmissible. 11 This situation could be altered if COVID-19 persists for a long time in an area with increased risk for communityacquired infections. Among the paediatric patients in our study, just under a third were asymptomatic. Moreover, a fifth had pneumonia only and needed radiographic examination to be identified. Symptoms seen on admission were variable, including cough and fever. All asymptomatic patients and children who did not present with pneu monia needed laboratory and radiographic examinations for diagnosis. The large proportion of children with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection contrasts with paediatric patients with H1N1 influenza 19 and SARS, 10 and adult patients with 17 in terms of presenting symptoms such as cough and pharyngeal congestion (table 3) , indicating SARS-CoV-2 has little effect on the upper respiratory tract of children. COVID-19 is highly transmissible, similar to SARS and H1N1 influenza, but can have a covert presentation in children.\nPneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death in children younger than 5 years. 21 Although COVID-19 in children seemed to be mild in term of presenting symptoms, the prevalence of pneumonia with COVID-19 (53%) was higher than with H1N1 influenza (11%), but very similar to the prevalence with SARS (65%). 18 A striking characteristic of COVID-19 is that it affects several vital organs (eg, lungs and heart), as shown by increased amounts of myocardial enzymes, even though all children with COVID-19 had the mild or moderate clinical type (table 3) . With high mortality in adult patients with COVID-19 in epidemic areas 6 (eg, >4% mortality in Wuhan), paediatric patients should continue to be monitored after discharge from hospital.\nCompared with adults, children rarely have comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Paediatric patients in our study had a lower prevalence of pneumonia and symptoms such as fever, cough, and dyspnoea compared with adult patients with COVID-19 (table 3) . However, in our study, the prevalence of leucopenia, lymphopenia, and increased myocardial enzymes in children with COVID-19 was similar to that in adults. Notably, adults have a much higher prevalence of increased C-reactive protein than do children, suggesting a much milder immunological response in children and less immune damage. 22 Except for antiviral drugs, no special treatments (eg, glucocorticoid therapy and invasive mechanical ventilation) were administered, and few children needed inhaled oxygen. Taking all these findings into con sideration, the presentation of COVID-19 in paediatric patients is much milder than in adults. It is noteworthy that few patients with coronavirus disease (ie, COVID-19 and SARS) have pharyngeal congestion or sore throat, which contrasts with patients with H1N1 influenza, despite the high prevalence of cough and fever in all patients. Pharyngeal congestion is more like an upper respiratory symptom than is fever (which is a systemic symptom) and cough, which can also be induced by a lower respiratory infection.\nThe findings of our study also showed that, although all paediatric cases were mild or moderate, the number of days spent in hospital and time needed for these patients to have negative PCR results was still considerable (table 1, figure 2) . The time to achieve a negative PCR result seemed to be unaffected by severity of disease in terms of symptoms and the presence of pneumonia and treatment choices. Nevertheless, fever resolved faster in mild cases than in moderate cases (figure 2). Considering that delayed clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools is a potential risk for transmission, 23 particularly in patients in rehabilitation, the reliability of viral RNA-negative criteria in asymptomatic patients, in the long run, needs further investigation.\nThe major limitation of our study was the small sample size. However, most results were consistent within the study and, with several case reports on children with COVID-19, we believe our conclusions are valid. Since COVID-19 is spreading in more countries and has become an urgent public health event, we present an early report on paediatric patients and expect additional data to improve our findings. In conclusion, our study shows that paediatric patients with COVID-19 have a simple transmission mode, either by close contact with infected adults or by exposure to epidemic areas. Although fever, dry cough, and mild pneumonia are common manifestations, nearly half of patients have neither obvious symptoms nor abnormal radiological findings. The proportion of asymptomatic cases indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients without clear epidemiological information. This finding suggests a dangerous situation if communityacquired infections occur.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-25","authors_x":"Qiu, Haiyan; Wu, Junhua; Hong, Liang; Luo, Yunling; Song, Qifa; Chen, Dong","journal_x":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","doi_x":"10.1016\/s1473-3099(20)30198-5","H index_x":201.0,"section":"Laboratory tests (reference values)","total_rank":0.0753655793,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[2164],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["investigati"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk"],[],[],["asymptomatic","asymptomatic","asymptomatic","asymptomatic","asymptomatic"],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],["route","route"],["age"],[],[],["health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"4090d8537051fae501355bc567dc2dec620762eb","title_x":"Journal Pre-proof Prevalence of comorbidities in the novel Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis Prevalence of comorbidities in the Novel Wuhan Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract_x":"\uf0b7 COVID -19 cases now confirmed in multiple countries.\n \uf0b7 assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in infected patients. \uf0b7 comorbidities are risk factors for severe patients compare with Non-severe.\n J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 \uf0b7 help the health sector guide vulnerable populations and assess the risk of deterioration.\n Background: An outbreak of Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, the epidemic is more widespread than initially estimated, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries.\n The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 infection patients and the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients.\n A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of sciences until February 25, 2020.

On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 epidemic a \"pandemic\" worldwide. 1 According to the latest updates from WHO (March 30), 693224 cases have been confirmed with COVID-19 in total worldwide, causing 33106 deaths. WHO has increased the risk assessment of COVID-19 to very high at global level. 2 Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is posing a major challenge to global public health, and seriously endangering the economy and the society.\nAs the forefront of the outbreak, China formulated and launched a series of emergency plans and supports in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the first place. Effective measures have been taken to control the pandemic in a timely manner. According to the principle of \"centralizing patients, centralizing experts, centralizing resources, and centralized treatment\", all confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been admitted into designated hospitals for standardized inpatient treatment, 3 which has greatly improved patients' outcomes, reduced mortality, and effectively contained further spread of the pandemic. On March 19, China reported no domestic new case for the first time, and the first prevail peak period of the pandemic was over, which was highly spoken as \"an amazing achievement\" by WHO.\nClinical treatment and management of COVID-19 hospitalized patients is constituting a prominent challenge worldwide. Some patients may quickly progress to severe or critical cases, with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction, particular in patients with complicated underlying diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, malignancy, etc.). 4, 5 Therefore, personalized, collaborative and multidisciplinary management is of great significance to improve patients' outcomes. With the pandemic getting increasingly serious, Chinese solution of \"centralizing COVID-19 patients and centralized inpatient treatment\" provides certain reference for other countries to control the pandemic.\nAccording to International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) guidance for pharmacists, 6 as a member of the healthcare professionals, it's one of the most essential responsibilities for hospital pharmacists to join the medical collaborative team and provide pharmaceutical care services to COVID-19 patients. For COVID-19 patients receiving centralized hospitalized treatment, pharmaceutical care services are https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.sapharm.2020.03.027 Received 31 March 2020; Accepted 31 March 2020 indispensable supplement for clinical treatment and management, which is of great significance for improving the level of drug therapy, improving patient's outcome and promoting the overall pandemic control. Detailed and feasible suggestions on clinical diagnosis and treatment were provided in clinical management guidance from National Health Committee (NHC) of China, WHO, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States. [7] [8] [9] However, it's worth mentioning that, most of the available guidance did not revolve detailed suggestions on therapeutic drugs or pharmaceutical care services. Currently, community pharmacists can provide strengthened pharmaceutical care and public health services following feasible instructions. 10, 11 However, for hospital pharmacists, recommendations and guidance on providing COVID-19 hospitalized patients with pharmaceutical care is still lacking, and need to be established urgently.\nBased on the Chinese perspective of \"centralizing COVID-19 patients and centralized inpatient treatment\", the purpose of the paper is to establish an integrated strategy for pharmaceutical care services, which focus on COVID-19 hospitalized patients and hospital pharmacists. Finally, it aims to provide guidance for hospital pharmacists to participate in the multidisciplinary team to improve COVID-19 patients' outcome and reduce mortality, and to facilitate the pandemic control.","publish_time_x":"2020-04-03","authors_x":"Song, Zaiwei; Hu, Yang; Zheng, Siqian; Yang, Li; Zhao, Rongsheng","journal_x":"Research in Social and Administrative Pharmacy","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.sapharm.2020.03.027","H index_x":37.0,"section":"","total_rank":0.0983847283,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[1816],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak","outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk"],[],[],[],[],[],[],["age","age","age","age"],[],[],["Health","health","health","Health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"5479e1d0baefe41058eca71bb114a61fb06c7ae9","title_x":"Hospital pharmacists' pharmaceutical care for hospitalized patients with COVID-19: Recommendations and guidance from clinical experience","abstract_x":"Objective: To discuss hospital pharmacists' role in providing pharmaceutical care for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 to promote patient care and management during the pandemic.

Patients were grouped by time from symptom onset: group 1 (scan before symptom onset; n=15), group 2 (scan \u22641 week after symptom onset; n=21), group 3 (scan >1 week to 2 weeks after symptom onset; n=30), and group 4 (scan >2 weeks to 3 weeks after symptom onset; n=15). lower than that of SARS or MERS coronavirus diseases; however, SARSCoV2 is highly infectious and could be a significant health threat. In our study, the predisposing conditions for COVID19 pneumonia tended to be old age and medical comor bidities (such as chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases), similar to previous viral infections such as influenza H7N9. 18, 19 There was no obvious predilection for males or females in our cohort. However, another study reported that 30 (73%) of 41 infected patients were men. 5 This discrepancy might be due to the differences in demographic features and small cohorts. By Feb 8, 2020, three patients in our study had died, representing a mortality rate of around 4%. All deaths occurred in men older than 60 years who had underlying diseases, consistent with previous reports. 5 Thus, old age, male sex, and presence of comorbidities might be risk factors for poor prognosis.\nFever, cough, and dyspnoea were the most common symptoms in patients with COVID19 pneumonia, consistent with the manifestation of lower respiratory tract infections. By contrast, upper respiratory tract symptoms were less common in these patients, indicating that the cells targeted by the virus might be located in the lower airway. 5 Other nonspecific symptoms included dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, headache, and generalised weakness, which occurred in around 2-9% of patients. Notably, 15 cases of asymptomatic infection were discovered on the basis of abnormal lung findings on CT scans, suggesting that chest CT scans or serum antibody tests should be done in asymptomatic highrisk individuals with a history of exposure to patients with COVID19 pneumonia to facilitate early identification of the disease.\nIn our cohort, leukocytosis was detected in 26 (32%) patients and lymphocytosis in 54 (67%) patients. Concentrations of Creactive protein and serum amyloid A protein were elevated in most patients, as observed in previous betacoronavirus infections. 10, 11, 20 In the subgroup of asymptomatic patients (group 1), concentrations of Creactive protein (6\u00b79 mg\/L) and aspartate amino transferase (30\u00b72 U\/L) were lower than those in symptomatic patients.\nThe mean number of involved lung segments in our cohort was 10\u00b75, with the right lower lobes most commonly affected. This finding is similar to those of a previous radiological study of patients with H7N9 influenza infection. 21 This finding might be due to the anatomical structure of the trachea and bronchi: as the right bronchus is short and straight, the causative virus might tend to favour this location.\nThe extent of disease on CT scans showed a marked increase from the subclinical period through the first and second weeks after symptom onset, then decreased gradually in the third week. A previous study showed that the median time from onset of symptoms to mechanical ventilation was 10\u00b75 days (IQR 7\u00b70-14\u00b70) and to intensive care unit admission was 10\u00b75 days (8\u00b70-17\u00b70). 5 Thus, our findings indicate that the radiological evolution of COVID19 pneumonia is consistent with the clinical course of the disease.\nMost patients in our cohort showed bilateral lung involvement, with lesions mainly located peripherally and subpleurally with diffuse distribution. The predominant pattern was groundglass opacity, with illdefined margins, air bronchograms, smooth or irregular inter lobular or septal thickening, and thickening of the adjacent pleura. These imaging characteristics are nonspecific and bear some resemblance to those of SARSCoV [22] [23] [24] and MERSCoV infections. 25, 26 However, unlike SARSCoV infections, some patients in our study presented with pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, and round cystic changes on CT. Previous studies showed that the presence of pleural effusion in patients infected with MERSCoV or avian influenza H5N1 was a poor prognostic indicator. 25, 27, 28 Similarly, in one patient who died in our study (patient 3), a followup CT scans showed that he had developed bila teral pleural effusion. On the other hand, lymphadenopathy has also been seen in cases of H5N1 infection, 28 which can present as a rapidly progressive pneumonia that results in ARDS. Round cystic changes on CT might be associated with the process of resorption of consolidation; which might be explained by the infection causing damage to the alveolar walls and leading to pneumatoceles. Other findings included intralobular or interlobular septal thickening, and a crazy paving pattern. However, none of the CT features of COVID19 seem to be specific or diagnostic, and COVID19 pneumonia shares CT features with other noninfectious conditions that present as subpleural air space disease. For example, patients with bronchiolitis obliterans with organising pneumonia 29, 30 often show nodules (32%), 29 lymphadenopathy (13%), 30 and pleural effusion (20%). 30 These findings were present, albeit with lower frequency, among our patients with COVID19 pneumonia (nodules 6%, lymphadenopathy 13%, pleural effusion 5%). However, treeinbud signs, masses, cavitations, and calcifications, often suggestive of bacterial or chronic infections, were absent in our study. The typical pattern of CT images in subclinical patients (group 1) was unilateral, multifocal, predominantly groundglass opacities. In the first week after symptom onset (group 2), lesions quickly evolved to bilateral, diffuse disease, with a relative decrease in the frequency of groundglass opacities and a transition to consolidation and mixedpattern development. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were also detected in group 2. Sub sequently, groundglass opacities continued to decrease in frequency throughout the second week after symptom onset (group 3), while consolidation became the second most common pattern. A reticular pattern associated with bronchiolectasis and irregular interlobular or septal thickening were also noted to increase pro gressively from the second week. These findings indicated the appearance of interstitial changes, suggesting the development of fibrosis. However, since the natural history of COVID19 pneumonia is yet to be fully explored, it is too early to label these lung changes as irreversible fibrosis. As the disease progressed in the third week after symptom onset, consolidation and mixed patterns became more common, while groundglass opacities decreased further. Bronchiolectasis, thickening of the adjacent pleura, and pleural effusion mainly appeared at this stage.\nSerial CT imaging of patients could help to con tinuously monitor disease changes. Followup CT showed pro gression or improvement of lung lesions during treatment, sensitively reflecting therapeutic effects, and these changes might be related to outcomes in such patients. The most common pattern of evolution throughout series of CT scans in this study was initial progression to a peak level, followed by radiographic improvement (type 1), and most of these patients were subsequently discharged. In addition, most patients who showed a pattern of radiographic improvement across several scans (type 3) were discharged from hospital. Thus, a type 1 or type 3 disease course might be associated with favourable outcomes. On the other hand, progressive radiographic deterioration despite medical treatment seems to be associated with poor prognosis, with two deaths in our study occurring among the 18 patients with the type 2 pattern.\nOur study had several limitations. First, at the time of data collection, nucleic acid testing for the diagnosis of SARSCoV2 infection had not yet been introduced at Union Hospital, and 33 patients were therefore diagnosed clinically on the basis of WHO criteria. 12 However, all these cases were confirmed by nucleic acid testing when kits became available later. Second, we compared imaging patterns between four groups of different time intervals from the onset of symptoms, which does not account for potential individual variations. Third, because of the short time for case collection, followup CT scans were available for only 57 patients, around 40% of whom had only two CT scans. Although we have outlined the main patterns of evolution seen on CT imaging in patients with COVID19 pneumonia, longterm radiological followup is needed to confirm our findings. Finally, as lung biopsy specimens were not available in this study, the relationship between radiological and histopathological findings remains to be investigated. Therefore, other potential causes of ground glass opacity, such as pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage, cannot be estimated.\nIn conclusion, COVID19 pneumonia tends to manifest on lung CT scans as bilateral, subpleural, groundglass opacities with air bronchograms, illdefined margins, and a slight predominance in the right lower lobe. Abnormal lung CT findings can be present even in asymptomatic patients, and lesions can rapidly evolve into a diffuse groundglass opacity predominance or consolidation pattern within 1-3 weeks after onset of symptoms, peaking at around 2 weeks after onset. Old age, male sex, under lying comorbidities and progressive radiographic deterio ration on followup CT might be risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with COVID19 pneumonia.","publish_time_x":"2020-02-24","authors_x":"Shi, Heshui; Han, Xiaoyu; Jiang, Nanchuan; Cao, Yukun; Alwalid, Osamah; Gu, Jin; Fan, Yanqing; Zheng, Chuansheng","journal_x":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","doi_x":"10.1016\/s1473-3099(20)30086-4","H index_x":201.0,"section":"Figure 3: Distribution of various patterns of lung changes on CT scans at various timepoints from symptom onset","total_rank":0.0389988359,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[695],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk","risk"],[],[],["asymptomatic","asymptomatic","asymptomatic","asymptomatic"],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],["health"],[],[],[],[],[],["factor","factor"],[],["Serial"]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"78ea5fa9437b7e90314416f066a38ad9b2d6e4cf","title_x":"Genotype and phenotype of COVID-19: Their roles in pathogenesis KEYWORDS","abstract_x":"COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus with an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, and then pandemic. Based on its phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures the COVID-19 belongs to genera Betacoronavirus. Human Betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) have many similarities, but also have differences in their genomic and phenotypic structure that can influence their pathogenesis. COVID-19 is containing singlestranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein. A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs. Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one-third of the genome near the 3 0 -terminus. The genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID-19 in pathogenesis is important. This article highlights the most important of these features compared to other Betacoronaviruses.","text_body":"Co-morbidities are cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as well as diabetes. Several abnormalities also have been observed including cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia injury, hepatic and kidney injury, and secondary bacterial infection. 16 In the majority of cases of severe disease and death, lymphopenia and sustained inflammation have been recorded. Notably, these observations in COVID-19 patients are similar to those who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic. There may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly. 17 Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Du et al. showed vaccines can be based on the S protein include full-length S protein, viral vector, DNA, recombinant S protein and recombinant RBD protein. Considering that, in the in vitro study, antiviral therapies are design based on S protein include RBDeACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs. 18 There are some recombinant compounds such as IFN with ribaverin which has only limited effects against COVID-19 infection. 1 The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2, while it is a lower affinity for SARS-CoV. 1, 19 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue ACE2, belongs to the ACE family of dipeptidylcarboxy dipeptidase. However, their physiological functions are varied. On the other hand, ACE2 serves as the binding site for COVID-19. Based on this information, Gurwitz suggested using available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections. 20 At present therapy is based on identifying and developing monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against COVID-19 combines with remdesivir as a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was used for the treatment of the Ebola virus disease. 17, 21 To understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to figure out whether COVID-19 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection considering its high mutation rate. Any adaptation in the COVID-19 sequence that might make it more efficient at transmitting among people might also boost its virulence. 22 The COVID-19 is expected to become less virulent through human to human transmissions due to genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions. 3","publish_time_x":"2020-03-31","authors_x":"Mousavizadeh, Leila; Ghasemi, Sorayya","journal_x":"Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.jmii.2020.03.022","H index_x":48.0,"section":"Factors affecting virus pathogenesis","total_rank":0.1540229885,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[73],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"15ef80e5c5a736ab6234ac18fd8d2798befcabf8","title_x":"Characteristics of COVID-19 infection in Beijing","abstract_x":"Background: Since the first case of a novel coronavirus infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Beijing.

Methods: We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS.

Estimated infection rates and mortality rates at the level of continents and some individual countries (when these are of sufficient size) are tabulated. This pandemic may cause close to half a billion deaths, i.e. 6% of the global populationand potentially more.

Infection cannot occur in the absence of contact. The only way to mitigate these numbers is to apply social distancing and take the standard precautions so frequently reiterated by Public Health: hand washing, avoid touching the face and so on. These measures are crucial as the human cost is going to be unthinkable even in the best-case scenarios that epidemiologists are modelling.","text_body":"The World Health Organisation estimates that \u2022 14% of infected cases are severe and require hospitalisation. \u2022 5% of infected cases are very severe and require intensive care admission, mostly for ventilation.\n\u2022 4% of infected die [9] . Severity is associated with increasing age and co-morbidities such as chronic heart and lung disease [9] .

This sets off a chain reaction, in this particular case, with T reach 60-80% infection rates. It is naturally difficult to estimate rates as quite a few individuals are infected and remain well (especially children) but are contagious [9] . For this reason, unless large proportions of populations are tested, we cannot possibly accurately estimate the total that have actually contracted the disease [8] .\nDraconian containment measures in China have reduced new cases by > 90% [10] . This has not been the case elsewhere, and Italy has been severely affected with the number of patients infected since February following an exponential trend [10] . Intensive care units have been overwhelmed, with the bottleneck being availability of ventilators to tide critically ill patients over their intensive care stay [10] . This had led to suggestions that multiple patients could be ventilated with one machine, effectively multiplying intensive care capacity to deal with such \"surges\" [11] . The careful application of basic containment measures cannot be overestimated: hand washing with soap and water, avoiding touching the face and social distancingstaying home, avoiding crowds and refraining from touching one another.\nSuch measures may blunt the rapid rise of cases, converting infections into a more manageable stream that hospitals can cope with [12] . If these measures are not widely enacted, large proportions of populations may become infected in short periods as happened in Northern Italy, and non-availability of ventilators may lead to triage situations with doctors having to choose who to ventilate and who to leave to die [13] . The situation may be even more dire in low income regions with fewer health care resources, such as Africa, where the relatively high prevalence of HIV, tuberculosis and other pathogens might not only serve as additional co-morbidities for COVID-19 infected individuals, but also contribute to diagnostic uncertainty [13] .","publish_time_x":"2020-05-31","authors_x":"Grech, Victor","journal_x":"Early Human Development","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.earlhumdev.2020.105026","H index_x":87.0,"section":"Methods","total_rank":0.151241535,"risk_factors":["tuberculosis"],"match_indices":[2258],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":1,"has_tuberculosis?":true,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age","age"],[],[],["Health","health"],["R0"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"f5cce8a5be5bc7be7a749a51ce8f71add6e5d08f","title_x":"Clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective, single-centre, descriptive study","abstract_x":"Background In December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China.

At present, few cases of infected pregnant women have been reported. This study is one of the first to report the maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 who are in their third trimesters. We have presented seven cases of COVID-19 in late pregnancy with good outcomes for both mother and infant.\nHuman coronaviruses are among the most common pathogens that cause respiratory infection. SARS-CoV-2 has enveloped virions that measure about 50-200 nm in diameter with a single positive-sense RNA genome. 11 COVID-19 is transmitted through respiratory droplets, physical contact, and aerosols, and there is evidence of human-to-human transmission. [12] [13] None of our pregnant patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, but all of them lived in the epidemic area. In terms of clinical manifestations, the common symptoms of these pregnant women at the onset of COVID-19 were fever and cough, and the less common symptoms were diarrhoea and shortness of breath. Laboratory tests showed that absolute lymphocyte counts were reduced, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and D-dimer were increased, and leucocytes were normal in most of the seven pregnant patients. In our study, these patients showed a pattern of clinical characteristics similar to those reported in non-pregnant adults with COVID-19.\nBecause COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease, the optimal treatment for affected individuals has not yet been established. In our study, most patients were treated with ribavirin, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Although remdesivir and other antiviral drugs have been used in the clinical treatment of patients with COVID-19, no data of their safety and efficacy as COVID-19 treatments have been published. No safety concerns have been identified related to the use of traditional Chinese medicine in our study. Five of our patients were treated with steroids (methylprednisolone 1-2 mg\/kg per day); however, animal Apgar score (1 min) 8-9 8-9 8-9 8-9 8-9 8-9 8-9\nApgar score (5 min) 9-10 9-10 9-10 9-10 9-10 9-10 9-10 studies have shown that the use of large doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy might lead to fetal malformation, and some studies have shown that the easy passage of corticosteroids through the placenta might increase the incidence of low birthweight in infants. 14 Therefore, steroids were only used after caesarean section in this study. Thus far, no complications related to the steroids have been recorded in the mothers and infants, but their safety still needs more data to draw conclusions. Because of alterations in hormone levels and decreased lung volumes caused by increases in uterus size during pregnancy, patients might have a more rapid clinical deterioration. Additionally, the influence of the virus itself and these antivirals and Chinese medicines on fetal development is unknown. Therefore, for full-term pregnant women, after consultation with a multi disciplinary team, delivering as soon as possible might be a better choice for the sake of safety considerations. Timely use of antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infections and strengthen immune support treatment can reduce complications and mortality, so antibiotics were used routinely after operation. 15 COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy is a complicated clinical scenario, and a multidisciplinary team of medical personnel is needed to care for and treat these patients comprehensively. Relevant specialty areas include obstetrics, infectious diseases, internal medicine, paediatrics, anaesthesia, psychology, and infection control. No medical staff had SARS-Cov-2 infections during the whole treatment period. The sequence similarity between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 is as high as 79%; 16 the mortality rate of SARS infection is 10%, 17 and the mortality rate of SARS in pregnant women was 25%. 18 Studies have reported that the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 is about 1\u00b74%. 19 In our study, the maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia are better than those with SARS infection. This might be associated with our small number of cases and short delivery time (ie, as soon as possible after diagnosis). Previous studies have shown no evidence of perinatal SARS infection in infants born to mothers who had SARS infection during pregnancy. 18, 20 One neonate in our study was infected with COVID-19 36 h after birth. However, the viral nucleic acid tests of the placenta and cord blood in this patient were negative for SARS-CoV-2, so intrauterine vertical transmission might not have occurred; thus, further study is needed.\nHowever, this study has several limitations. First, only seven pregnant women with COVID-19 were included in the analyses. More infected pregnant women and comparative studies (eg, cohorts, case-control) should be analysed to get a more comprehensive understanding of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Second, all enrolled patients were in the third trimester, so the effect of the virus infection on the fetus in the first or second trimester is unknown. Third, due to the short time of the outbreak, the long-term out comes of the neonates and whether mother-to-child transmission exists require further study. However, the data in this study permit an early assessment of the clinical characteristics and maternal and fetal outcomes of COVID-19 in late pregnancy in women in Wuhan, China.\nIn conclusion, the clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 during late pregnancy are similar to those reported by non-pregnant adults with COVID-19. The maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of those pregnant women infected in late pregnancy appear very good, and these outcomes are achieved with intensive, active management, which might be the best practice in absence of more robust data. Long-term outcomes and potential mother-to-child vertical transmission needs further study.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-24","authors_x":"Yu, Nan; Li, Wei; Kang, Qingling; Xiong, Zhi; Wang, Shaoshuai; Lin, Xingguang; Liu, Yanyan; Xiao, Juan; Liu, Haiyi; Deng, Dongrui; Chen, Suhua; Zeng, Wanjiang; Feng, Ling; Wu, Jianli","journal_x":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","doi_x":"10.1016\/s1473-3099(20)30176-6","H index_x":201.0,"section":"Discussion","total_rank":0.0943755958,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[99,172,294,408,835,1025,1354,1480,2311,2850,3067,3454,3994,4171,4501,4861,4935,5078,5543,5667,5714,5797,5829],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":33,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":true,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"69f5a8a8d9fa14f784d4d7f8d40e24ccc0238da0","title_x":"COVID-19 and ART: the view of the Italian Society of Fertility and Sterility and Reproductive Medicine","abstract_x":"The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global situation.

Moreover, confirmation of infection at present consists mainly of PCR for acute illness and, although many serological tests to identify antibodies are being developed, they require validation with well-characterized sera before being considered reliable.\nThe current scenario is fluid especially dealing with the impact of COVID-19 on gestations. To date, Fan et al hypothesized no vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which was not reported in all screened products of conception and newborns (two whose mothers were infected) (Fan et al., 2020) . Evidence confirmed this also in 9 late pregnancies described in the Lancet by Chen et al (Chen et al., 2020) . Clearly, infected (or suspected to be infected) mothers must avoid close contact with the newborns, especially avoiding breastfeeding, as highlighted by Qiao in its comment to Chen's report (Qiao, 2020) . In general, all these evidences must be confirmed in larger studies, especially since equally-underpowered and possibly-biased reports of adverse gestational\/neonatal outcomes have been also reported (Liu et al., 2020b , Liu et al., 2020a .\nWhen it comes to the first or second trimester of gestation, the latest updates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not report any issue to date (https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/prepare\/pregnancybreastfeeding.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/specific-groups\/pregnancy-faq.html), but conclusive information on its risks are clearly missing (Liang and Acharya, 2020) . Of note, the drugs and the aid actions required in case of gestational issues are strongly contra-indicated in the first and second trimester.

The 4 hospitals selected for the study were the closest hospitals in proximity to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (1-4 km away), which is the suspected origin of 2019-nCoV outbreak (Fig 2) . Anesthesiologists in Wuhan have made great efforts to control this epidemic (Fig 3) . As previously mentioned, anesthetic management and infection control guidelines for emergency procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV were drafted by an expert panel from the Department of Anesthesiology at Wuhan Union Hospital (Fig 4) ; these procedures are detailed in the Supplementary Material as follows: (1) anesthesiologists' procedures for emergency intubation of patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV infection, (2) precautions for 2019-nCoV infection in outpatient evaluation center, and (3) precautions for 2019-nCoV infection control in the operating rooms.

Communities around the world have been advised to stay in their homes as much as possible, avoid gatherings, frequently wash their hands or employ other hand hygiene techniques, remain at least 1-2 m away from others (\"social distancing\"), and avoid touching their faces to avoid or delay transmission of 2019-nCOV. 1, 2 These guidelines would severely hamper many day-to-day activities if implemented at a high level of fidelity, so voluntary compliance is likely to be uneven at best.\nHealthcare professionals across all settings are now caring for and communicating with patients in a context of high uncertainty. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak will not be clear for a long time, but greater adherence to the lifestyle modifications suggested by healthcare and public health organizations will greatly delay the spread of the disease. This, in turn, will keep hospitals and clinics from being overwhelmed. For example, hospitals are overburdened in parts of Italy, which is projected to have approximately 80% of its total ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients before April 2020. 6 As healthcare professionals with a high public availability, community pharmacists are likely to be many patients' first option for health information. Patients may present to community pharmacies for refills or new prescriptions; prescribers may cancel non-urgent appointments, which would make the community pharmacist a sole point of in-person contact with the healthcare system. It is therefore imperative that community pharmacists be equipped with knowledge and tools to communicate clearly and effectively with patients about ways to limit the impact of COVID-19.\nAs the situation continues to develop over days and weeks instead of months and years, community pharmacists are unlikely to have a readymade and field-tested communication toolkit regarding COVID-19 until after the time to act has passed. In situations such as these, evidencebased public health frameworks can provide a useful temporary measure in much the same way that prescribers may rely on data from small, open label trials until data from higher-quality trials are available. These public health frameworks can act as a \"checklist\" that pharmacists and other healthcare professionals can use to guide their communication and reinforce healthy behaviors.\nOne such framework is the Health Belief Model (HBM). The HBM was originally developed to study why patients may not seek screening for tuberculosis, 7 and is one of the most prominent public health frameworks for understanding why individuals may or may not act in the face of a threat to personal or community health. The HBM has been used for decades to study vaccination, medication adherence, diabetes self-care, condom use, and other behaviors that require modification of a patient's actions to mitigate a threat to health. 8, 9 Like many public health behavior models, the HBM studies behavior at an individual and community level by conceptualizing the determinants of behavior into several contributing factors called constructs. The HBM has evolved over time and many modified forms are present in literature; this article will operationalize the HBM as pictured in Fig. 1 , adapted from Champion and Skinner. 7 Broadly, the HBM suggests that individual beliefs and direct cues to action inform behavior. In turn, beliefs are informed by one's background and are comprised of one's impression of the perceived threat, the perceived benefits to taking action, the perceived barriers to taking action, and one's perceived ability to take action (i.e., perceived self-efficacy). The purpose of this article is to explain how community pharmacist can use the constructs of the HBM as a communication guide to move patients toward behaviors that will limit the spread of COVID-19.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-26","authors_x":"Carico, Ronald \u201cRon\u201d; Sheppard, Jordan; Thomas, C.

In the HBM, an individual is considered more likely to take appropriate action if the perceived threat of the disease is large. In turn, the perceived threat will be larger if the perceived severity is larger-that is, the disease is regarded as a serious problem. Similarly, perceived threat will also be larger if perceived susceptibility is larger-that is, the adverse outcome is regarded as something the individual could reasonably experience.\nWhen considering COVID-19 in the context of the HBM, community pharmacists may be poised to act most directly and most powerfully on these constructs. Educating the community on health risks is a core function of community pharmacy in most places, and community pharmacists are likely to be trusted members of their communities. Acting on these constructs may mean educating on individual-or community-level threats, incorporating patient-level modifying factors and epidemiological findings as appropriate. For example, early data strongly suggest that older patients with the disease are more likely to experience viral pneumonia, hospitalization, or other significant adverse health outcomes; the odds of death may be as high as 15% in patients over the age of 80. 4, 5 Patients are also more likely to experience severe illness with COVID-19 if they have diabetes, COPD, or cardiovascular disease at baseline, or if they smoke or are male. 5 Conversely, pharmacists must be careful to avoid implying that there is no threat to younger, healthier individuals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 38% of COVID-19 hospitalizations may have occurred in patients under the age of 55. 10 It may be worthwhile to ask patients if they would tolerate a comparable chance of a similarly-negative avoidable outcome, such as an automobile accident that results in injury. Community-level threats may also be salient to those at lower individual risk. If a younger individual is from a culture that places a high value on family or the elderly, the pharmacist may want to underscore the risks of transmitting the disease to family members or older community members. Again, the pharmacist could ask if the individual would drive recklessly with valued family members in their automobile, for instance. Some discretion may be needed when interacting with members of the community who have anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or other mental health concerns that may predispose to unhealthy fixation on the threat posed by COVID-19. When interacting with these individuals, community pharmacists may instead choose to leverage other constructs in the HBM to motivate behavior change without producing undue distress, such as perceived benefits and perceived self-efficacy. This may be an exception to previous guidance to deploy as many constructs of the HBM as possible.\nExample questions to assess threat constructs:\n\u2022 \"How big of a problem do you think the coronavirus is?\" \u2022 \"How serious do you think it would be if someone like you got the coronavirus?\"\n\u2022 \"Why do you think someone like you might contract the coronavirus?\"","publish_time_x":"2020-03-26","authors_x":"Carico, Ronald \u201cRon\u201d; Sheppard, Jordan; Thomas, C.

This is distinct from simply avoiding an adverse health outcome, which is covered by threat-related constructs. For example, a person who engages in smoking cessation behavior may avoid the perceived threat of chronic lung disease, but may also accumulate the perceived benefit of having more money due to decreased expenditures on tobacco.\nIn the case of the behaviors suggested in response to COVID-19, community pharmacists may struggle to identify perceived benefits without knowing the individual in question. However, as previously noted, personal relationships with community members are a unique strength of the community pharmacist. Perhaps patients who shift to a work-from-home paradigm will find they have more free time due to decreased commutes, for instance. More time at home may also mean more time with family members, which could be welcome. Conversely, it may also be an excellent opportunity to spend quality time alone, if that is perceived as valuable. Spending time away from crowds may present an opportunity to cultivate a hobby or habit, such as reading or hiking.

Effective mitigation of the disease will require nontrivial efforts from a significant fraction of the world population, including social distancing and avoiding unnecessary interactions with others. No matter how stringently these measures are recommended, a fraction of people may not believe that they can or should act in ways that will limit the threat. The HBM is a model that has been used to study behaviors related to preventing or mitigating disease. It conceptualizes beliefs about disease as being comprised of the perception of the threat as severe and relevant, the perception of benefits of and barriers to acting, and the perception of one's intrinsic ability to act. As trusted, community-facing healthcare professionals, pharmacists are uniquely suited to bring about change in patient behaviors. Community pharmacists using HBM to reinforce COVID-19 mitigation behaviors should appropriately emphasize the severity and susceptibility of the threat, emphasize barriers to acting, help patients identify ways to overcome barriers to acting, and reinforce self-efficacy beliefs.\nPublic health frameworks such as HBM are not entirely foreign to pharmacy as a profession. The transtheoretical \"states of change\" model has been used in the context of smoking cessation. 11 While the profession is likely less aware of other frameworks, such as HBM, there is reason to believe that pharmacists can deploy tools like HBM effectively. Ideally, such a deployment would be accompanied by strong assessment tools; however, the speed with which the COVID-19 situation is evolving necessitates a less evidence-based approach than might otherwise be used.\nLimitations of the HBM must be acknowledged. Unlike some other public health frameworks, it does not directly incorporate constructs such as social norms and community assumptions, which are instead \"baked in\" at the level of underlying demographic factors. It is also unclear if the HBM applies directly to an effort as large as the ones being mobilized to combat COVID-19. However, this critique could be levied at most approaches that might be brought to bear on this unique situation.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-26","authors_x":"Carico, Ronald \u201cRon\u201d; Sheppard, Jordan; Thomas, C.

In particular, containing a risk of postnatal transmission from mother to neonate and procedures to accommodate unscheduled patient presentations to labour ward and emergency care; all within an environment of high patient turnover.\nPerforming common procedures for obstetric patients, such as neuraxial anaesthesia, is made more technically difficult and time consuming by PPE. These indirect risks mandate a change in approach for team working, information dissemination and decision making in the labour ward.\nAlthough evidence is limited at present, antenatal vertical transmission appears rare. 66 Placental samples, amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs and breastmilk samples from COVID-19 infected mothers have all tested negative in case series. 67, 68 There is currently no evidence concerning transmission through genital fluids.\nWomen presenting to labour ward should be screened prior to admission, then risk stratified, and resultant care provided in an appropriate environment. Increased ventilation during labour, particularly when coupled with symptoms secondary to COVID-19 lung sequelae, may increase airborne transmission. For these reasons, surgical facemasks should be worn by parturients.

Although thrombocytopenia appears to be more common in COVID-19 infected patients 32 , neuraxial anaesthesia is not otherwise contraindicated and early epidural analgesia appears to be a preferred and pragmatic option for providing safe patient care. 31 Use of birthing pools should be avoided in suspected or confirmed cases, given the inability to use adequate PPE for healthcare staff during water birth.\nDonning PPE is time consuming, yet expedient delivery of a neonate remains time critical in situations of neonatal distress.

As information concerning the COVID-19 disease continues to evolve, patients look to their eye care practitioners for accurate eye health guidance. There is currently no evidence to suggest an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 through contact lens (CL) wear compared to spectacle lens wear and no scientific evidence that wearing standard prescription spectacles provides protection against COVID-19 or other viral transmissions.\n During the pandemic there will potentially be significant changes in access to local eyecare. Thus, it is imperative CL wearers are reminded of the steps they should follow to minimise their risk of complications, to reduce their need to leave isolation and seek care. Management of adverse events should be retained within optometric systems if possible, to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare service, which will be stretched. Optimal CL care behaviours should be the same as those under normal circumstances, which include appropriate hand washing (thoroughly with soap and water) and drying (with paper towels) before both CL application and removal. Daily CL cleaning and correct case care for reusable CL should be followed according to appropriate guidelines, and CL exposure to water must be avoided. Where the availability of local clinical care is restricted, practitioners should consider advising patients to reduce or eliminate sleeping in their CL (where patients have the appropriate knowledge about correct daily care and access to suitable lens-care products) or consider the option of moving patients to daily disposable lenses (where patients have appropriate lens supplies available). Patients should also avoid touching their face, including their eyes, nose and mouth, with unwashed hands and avoid CL wear altogether if unwell (particularly with any cold or flu-like symptoms).","text_body":"The evidence presented in this paper suggests the safety of contact lens wear has not altered due to the pandemic and that appropriate hygiene considerations for contact lens wear and care should be the same as that always recommended. However, with local access to eyecare being different at this time of social distancing, and potentially severely compromised during the height of the pandemic, what should eye care professionals bear in mind when discussing contact lens wear with their patients?\nA key consideration is for practitioners to be cognizant of local clinical care facilities during the course of the pandemic and to act to minimise the impact of contact lens-related adverse events on the wider healthcare system, which may be very stretched as staff are moved from providing ophthalmic care to other areas more directly related to COVID-19 patients. The implications here will necessarily vary according to local and regional considerations. For example, as of March 24, 2020, routine eyecare has been suspended in many countries, with optometric practices moving to provide scaled-back provision, telephone-only consultations and\/or emergency services. For example, in the United Kingdom, practitioners should work to manage cases within an optometric framework rather than refer into the National Health Service where possible. This could include telephone contact with patients reporting contact lens problems and\/or a video consultation using a suitable mobile phone app to enable rapid triage and management, reducing the need for burdening other clinical colleagues. Some cases may be best managed by referral to optometric colleagues licensed to practice as Independent Prescribers (therapeutically qualified optometrists) and who can treat more significant contact lens adverse events. In other cases, local Minor Eye Conditions Services (MECS) may be an alterative care pathway. Under this service patients are sent to local optometrists who have undergone accredited training in advanced optometric care that can triage whether referral to ophthalmology is required and, where possible and within their scope of practice, treat minor eye conditions. It is imperative that eyecare professionals avail themselves of the relevant options as early as possible in order to act quickly in the interests of both their patients and the wider healthcare system, and not begin to investigate the possibilities only after a contact lens wearer reports having some form of adverse event.\nIn North America, Australia and other regions\/countries, therapeutically-endorsed optometrists are more likely to be the first port of call for contact lens patients with clinical adverse events, although again, most health authorities have required deferral of non-emergent, routine care. Here also, appropriate pathways need to be considered and enacted where a reduced level of routine eyecare is available. In countries where contact lens fitters and practitioners are less likely to offer clinical care to patients with clinically significant adverse events, management pathways and advice should again be considered to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare system.\nIt is particularly imperative during the ongoing pandemic that practitioners redouble their efforts to provide clinical advice to their patients to minimise contact lens complications, not least because many parts of the world are in forms of 'lockdown' and even leaving home to seek attention may not be straightforward. The simplest approach, as recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, would be to cease contact lens wear and return to spectacles during this time [97] . However, given the personal motivation individuals may have for wearing contact lenses, or indeed those wearing lenses for a clinical reason (keratoconus for example), this suggestion is likely not practical for many contact lens wearers. In the UK, the General Optical Council have taken a pragmatic approach to contact lens wear and supply during the pandemic. Releasing a joint statement with a number of other health care regulators, they recognise the highly challenging circumstances and the need to depart from established procedures [98] . They have offered guidance which enables practitioners to exercise their professional judgement on whether patients need to be seen, or whether, following remote consultation, that the best course of action is to continue to supply lenses, even in the case of an expired specification [98] . This action will act to ensure a continual supply of new lenses to wearers and significantly reduce any temptation from patients to use lenses beyond the recommended replacement interval. Practitioners should also act to ensure patients receive a supply of their prescribed lens type and communicate this appropriately, to dissuade patients from sourcing alternative (non-prescribed) lens brands via online lens retailers.\nIt is important to remember that by any absolute measure, contact lens wear is a safe form of vision correction for millions of people around the world. A review of 1276 soft contact lens wearers records, across 4120 visits, found eighty-two percent did not present with any complications during the observation period of more than two years [99] . The frequency of more significant complications such as corneal infiltrative events (CIEs) and microbial keratitis are well understood. The annual incidence of symptomatic CIEs in daily reusable soft lens wear is around 3%, and nearly zero in daily disposable wear [100] . The incidence of symptomatic CIEs in extended wear is higher, with a 2\u22127x increased risk compared to daily wear [101] [102] [103] . Annual incidence of microbial keratitis (MK) varies by modality, and is around 2 per 10,000 wearers with daily wear of soft lenses, [13, 15, 104] increasing to around 20 per 10,000 wearers in extended soft lens wear, irrespective of material type [13, 14, 105, 106] .\nHowever, a valid concern arises that any contact lens complication that warrants a visit to a healthcare facility at this time of limited resources is potentially an issue. To put these risks into context it is helpful to consider the incidence of contact lens issues in relation to accidental home-based injuries that also require medical care. In the U.S in 2012, a total of 19.4 million home injuries occurred that required medical attention, representing a rate of 24.17 per 100,000 of population [107] . A study across two years in Belgium estimated the annual incidence of home incidents requiring management by general practitioners to be 2194 per 100,000 people [108] . Within the context of these figures, contact lens wear, with a rate for microbial keratitis of 0.2-2 per 100,000 (i.e. 2-20 per 10,000) wearers does not represent a significant additional burden on the healthcare system compared to the inherent dangers of living within the home, which based on their incidence as quoted above, would result in a far greater number of injuries that may require medical attention during the pandemic.\nHow could the risks of contact lens wear be further minimised to reduce any potential burden on hospital visits at this time? The risk factors that result in CIEs and infectious keratitis are well understood. The relative risks of developing CIEs are summarised in the comprehensive review by Steele and Szczotka-Flynn, [11] and include nonmodifiable factors such as younger age (1.75-2.61x), higher prescription (\u22655D) (1.21\u22121.6x) and history of a previous event (2.5-6.1x), along with modifiable risks such as overnight wear (2.5\u22127x), bacterial bioburden on the lens and lid margins (5\u22128x), and lens replacement schedule -reusable compared to daily disposable (12.5x). MK is associated with many similar factors, including overnight wear [13, 105, 106] , and for daily wear, poor lens and storage case hygiene, infrequent lens case replacement, exposure to water and smoking [109, 110] . Risk factors for MK in daily disposable wearers are more frequent use, any overnight wear, less frequent handwashing, and smoking [111] . While it is not possible to change a non-modifiable risk factor such as the age of a patient, there are significant opportunities to address modifiable behaviours. Given the reduced incidence of CIEs in wearers of daily disposable lenses [99, 100] , this form of lens wear seems ideal in a time of reduced clinical provision. Some patients hold supplies of both reusable and daily disposable contact lenses, with the latter normally used for sports or holidays. With appropriate practitioner discussion, a move to using daily disposable lenses could be recommended at the current time.\nCeasing planned or accidental overnight wear significantly lowers the risk of contact lens complications. Some patients may principally use their lenses on an extended wear basis for occupational reasons and the same benefits may no longer be present if they are currently working from home. In such situations, reverting to a daily wear schedule could be meritedalthough only if the patient has an appropriate care regimen and is suitably compliant in its correct use. In the same way, patients who habitually alter from daily wear to extended wear over time (for work or other reasons) may be best advised to adopt a routine daily wear modality until normal clinical provision is available. Such changes to contact lens wearing schedules should be undertaken only after consultation between the patient and their contact lens practitioner.\nScrupulous hand hygiene along with correct use of multipurpose solutions with rub and rinse cleaning of reusable lenses, daily case cleaning and regular replacement of the lens case are all positive changes about which eye care professionals should remind their patients at the current time. Likewise, an important point is to counsel on the avoidance of contact with water to reduce the risk of microbial keratitis, especially Acanthamoeba keratitis which has been increasing in recent years [112, 113] . Finally, a patient who has access to both reusable and daily disposable contact lenses at home could be advised to switch to daily disposables, the modality with the lowest risk of complications in soft lens wear [73, 100] .\nAdherence to compliant lens wear and care practices is an important aim for the profession all of the time, however, it can be argued during the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 this should be an area of heightened focus. The attention on thorough hand washing is welcome and an important start, but for eye care practitioners it is reasonable to use this time to go much further, revisiting patient education on safe wear and care practices with the aim of reducing the chance of developing contact lens-related complications requiring clinical care.","publish_time_x":"2020-04-03","authors_x":"Jones, Lyndon; Walsh, Karen; Willcox, Mark; Morgan, Philip; Nichols, Jason","journal_x":"Contact Lens and Anterior Eye","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.clae.2020.03.012","H index_x":43.0,"section":"Access to clinical care and considerations for contact lens wear during the pandemic","total_rank":0.0361125863,"risk_factors":["smoking"],"match_indices":[7931,8074],"smoking_count":2,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","Risk","risk","risk","risk","risk"],[],[],[],["infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],["health","Health","health","health","health","health","health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],["factor","factor","factor","factor","factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"b192c480634563daf7c8bec3c6c937d08de6fe23","title_x":"Understanding the \"Scope\" of the Problem: Why Laparoscopy is Considered Safe During the COVID-19 Pandemic","abstract_x":"Precis: During the COVID-19 pandemic, laparoscopy is safe and achieves the goal of optimizing patient care and outcomes while minimizing risk to the surgical team.","text_body":"The novel nature of the COVID-19 pandemic presents many challenges to gynecologists working to optimize the care of their patients. No part of our practice has been more disrupted than the ability to offer timely procedures to our patients with gynecologic surgical indications.\nDespite efforts to limit elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, urgent and emergent procedures must still be performed. For many of these urgent procedures, such as ruptured ectopic pregnancy, hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, or ovarian torsion, laparoscopy may offer the best surgical approach and outcomes for the patient. However, some have suggested that laparoscopic procedures should be avoided, and laparotomy procedures be universally employed when a patient is COVID-19 positive or status is unknown due to concerns about aerosolization of viral particles via the pneumoperitoneum. We strongly disagree with this premise. Based on best available evidence, we concur with both the recent U.S. joint professional society statement on minimally invasive gynecology during the COVID-19 pandemic (1) as well as the European joint society statements (2) endorsing laparoscopy as a safe surgical approach in this setting.\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a respiratory pathogen. Both RNA and infectious virus are detected primarily from human upper and lower respiratory tract specimens.\nThe COVID-19 virions are approximately 0.125 micron in size and are most commonly transmitted as larger (> 20 microns) respiratory water droplets. The virus may also be aerosolized and transmitted in smaller droplets (< 10 microns) in gas suspension. Particle size has implications for suspension time and filtration requirements. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in blood and stool specimens, but it is unknown if infectious virus is present in these extrapulmonary specimens (3) . To date, no studies have identified SARS-CoV-2 in surgical smoke, and even if found, it is not known whether these viral particles are infectious.\nAdditionally, while viral RNA may be detected in the blood, no transmission of COVID-19 has been documented through this route (4) .\nWhat have we learned from other viral epidemics and surgical risks? That the risk of viral disease transmission with laparoscopy is virtually zero. Although the viral DNA of blood-borne viral pathogens, such as hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have been detected in surgical plume after the use of surgical energy (e.g. electrosurgery, laser and harmonic scalpel, there is no evidence to indicate that use of electrosurgery during laparoscopy increases the risk of disease transmission via the surgical plume or pneumoperitoneum (5,6).\nFurther, surgery in patients with HIV and hepatitis B and C has been ongoing for decades, without documented increased risk of transmission from the surgical plume or laparoscopic pneumoperitoneum to surgeons, anesthesiologists or operating room personnel. In fact, when possible, laparoscopic techniques that significantly minimize exposure of surgeons to bloodborne pathogens is far preferred to laparotomy.\nAdditionally, although COVID-19 is a novel disease, evidence from similar respiratory viruses, such as influenza and other coronaviruses (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)), have not shown evidence of disease transmission through surgical plume or laparoscopic gas during prior viral epidemics or annual flu seasons (7) . The bottom line is: there is no compelling data to support the notion that respiratory or blood-borne infectious viruses are transmitted through the surgical plume or aerosolized laparoscopic gas.\nOne must also consider the adverse impact of adopting overarching policy changes (such as \"laparotomy is better during the COVID-19 pandemic because of theoretical aerosolization risks\") based on erroneous assumptions. What is not theoretical is that converting more cases to laparotomy during the COVID-19 pandemic will have dire downstream consequences, including prolonged hospital stays and bed utilization, an increased likelihood of intensive care unit stay, greater risk of patient harm from surgical complications (including undesirable pulmonary issues during a respiratory viral crisis), and greater risks of COVID-19 exposure for both the patient and health care providers. Given the lack of data to support the claim that COVID-19 virus spreads via the laparoscopic smoke plume or pneumoperitoneum, one cannot justify the increased utilization of precious resources, greater number of surgical complications, and infectious exposure risks to patient and caregivers that would result if laparoscopic approaches were abandoned during this period.\nNevertheless, despite this reassuring data, precautions should be considered to minimize any potential or theoretical risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are several relevant safety considerations for clinical teams who participate in gynecologic surgery during this time.\nLaparoscopy most commonly involves general anesthesia, with the associated intubation, extubation, and mechanical ventilation, which may produce airborne viral droplets in a COVID-19 positive patient. General anesthesia is not contraindicated in COVID-19 confirmed patients, but the surgical team should minimize exposure to airborne virus during intubation and extubation and OR personnel should don adequate PPE including face shields, N95 filtered masks if available, gowns and gloves. Even if it is assumed that limited viral particles may become airborne via pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopy, the operating room is one of the safest places in the hospital to avoid COVID-19 exposure, given the air filtration\/circulation in most standard ORs, the sterile field, and surgeons and anesthesiologist will be wearing PPE.\nSeveral techniques can be used to minimize the potential risk of airborne viral particles at the time of surgery via any route, and specifically during laparoscopy. Performing laparoscopy with lower intraabdominal CO2 pressures and minimizing the use of energy will limit the production of surgical plume and pneumoperitoneum. Additionally, the use of a smoke evacuation\/filtration system allows for controlled release and filtration of the surgical plume. Ideally, gas and plume evacuation and filtration is accomplished with the use of ultralow particulate air filter (ULPA) rated to screen particles of 0.1 micron in diameter (e.g., the ConMed Airseal or Stryker Pneumoseal). In contrast, high efficiency air filters (HEPA) are only required to filter particles of 0.3 micron in diameter. Of note, N95 masks are rated to filter out at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles. (3) While smoke evacuation and filtration systems can be used both at the time of laparoscopy and laparotomy, laparoscopy offers the unique advantage of being able to almost entirely contain the surgical plume in the abdominal cavity. In conjunction with tightly fitting laparoscopic ports, an evacuation\/filtration system can be used to minimize release of potential airborne virus into the operating room environment, while simultaneously evacuating the surgical smoke actively or passively. It is important to avoid sudden release of the pneumoperitoneum. This is most relevant prior to tissue extraction, whether via a minilaparotomy or vaginally, and at the completion of the surgery. At these times, the abdominal cavity should be actively desufflated through a filtration system or with a simple piece of tubing attached to a suction canister, rather than releasing the pneumoperitoneum into the operating room. Use of a containment bag for tissue extraction can help maintain seal and may limit loss of pneumoperitoneum. This is in contrast to smoke evacuation at the time of laparotomy, where containment of the surgical smoke is challenging, if not impossible. The smoke evacuator must ideally be within 2 cm of the source, with 50% loss of capture for every 1 cm from the source of the plume. If COVID-19 particles can indeed be disseminated into the surgical plume, then surgeons and OR personnel may be more likely to experience direct exposure to viral particles from a laparotomy approach.\nIn summary, laparoscopy remains the preferred surgical approach for gynecologic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic for most surgical indications. The theoretical risk of airborne SARS-CoV-2 from an abdominal source at the time of surgery has not been substantiated.\nThere is no current evidence that infection of OR personnel occurs via laparoscopy any more so than laparotomy surgery. However, given the paucity of data, it is prudent to take precautions in the operating room given that viral particles can be aerosolized during intubation and extubation. We believe laparoscopy offers the opportunity for better containment and filtration of the surgical gas and plume compared with laparotomy, and continues to offer vastly more health benefits, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic and when precious PPE and hospital resources as well as minimizing viral exposure risks are so critical to mitigating this public health crisis. Let's not lose sight of the \"scope\" of the problem: it is imprudent, and even dangerous, to blindly abandon tried-and-true, safe surgical practices during a viral pandemic. Laparoscopy, when clinically appropriate, achieves the goal of optimizing patient care and outcomes, while minimizing risk to the surgical and perioperative teams.","publish_time_x":"2020-04-03","authors_x":"Morris, Stephanie N; Fader, Amanda Nickles; Milad, Magdy P; Dionisi, Humberto J","journal_x":"Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.jmig.2020.04.002","H index_x":70.0,"section":"","total_rank":0.0473484848,"risk_factors":["smoking","pregnancy"],"match_indices":[1932,4470,6207,6749,7204,7791,7869,7914,469],"smoking_count":8,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":1,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk"],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],["route","route"],["age"],[],[],["health","health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"37a817ed944f1f10040399d60e39e2254f405311","title_x":"Journal Pre-proof Recommendations on management of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) in kidney transplant patients","abstract_x":"J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SPECIAL ARTICLE Recommendations on the management of the SARS-Co V-2 coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) in kidney transplant patients Recomendaciones en el manejo de la pandemia por coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) en pacientes con trasplante renal SUMMARY The SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic is evolving very quickly and means a special risk for both immunosuppressed and comorbid patients.

The etiology was identified as a new coronavirus, with a supposed zoonotic origin. The virus has been recently named the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease has been called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 2 .\nSo far, there is uncertainty regarding the transmission capacity of the virus. Recent studies show the presence of a high viral load in the oropharynx at early stages of the disease, which increases the concern about the high risk of infectivity during incubation periods or with only mild symptoms 3 . The average incubation period has been estimated to be 5-6 days, with a range of 1-14 days. In over 80% of cases the symptoms of the disease are mild (fever, cough, expectoration, general malaise), while approximately 20% may have serious clinical manifestations ( pneumonia and other clinical complications) that require hospital admission.\n. Pregnant women, newborns , the elderly , immunocompromised and patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease , are more to be infected by COVID-19 , and they are more likely to suffer severe illness that often requires to be admitted to ICU. The impact of COVID-19 on chronic kidney disease has been scantily reported 4 . Current mortality rate in China is 3.9 % of the cases confirmed by the lab, which is very similar to that of Spain 3.7% (Data as of March 16, 2020) 5 .

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantitatively summarize results from published studies to date to provide a summary of evidence on detection of COVID-19 by chest CT and the expected CT imaging manifestations.\n Studies were identified by searching PubMed database for articles published December 2019 -February 2020. Pooled CT positive rate of COVID-19\n and pooled incidence of CT imaging findings were estimated using a random-effect model.\n A total of 13 studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled positive rate of the CT imaging was 89.76% and 90.35% when only including thin-section chest CT. Typical CT signs were ground glass opacities (GGO) (83.31%), GGO with mixed consolidation (58.42%), adjacent pleura thickening (52.46%), interlobular septal thickening (48.46%), and air bronchograms (46.46%). Other CT signs included crazy paving pattern (14.81%), pleural effusion (5.88%), bronchiectasis (5.42%), pericardial effusion (4.55%) and lymphadenopathy (3.38%). The most anatomic distributions were bilateral lung infection (78.2%) and peripheral distribution (76.95%). The incidences were highest in the right lower lobe (87.21%), left lower lobe (81.41%), and bilateral lower lobes (65.22%). The right upper lobe (65.22%), right middle lobe (54.95%) and left upper lobe (69.43%) were also commonly involved. The incidence of bilateral upper lobes was 60.87%. A considerable proportion of patients had 3 or more lobes involved (70.81%).\n The detection of COVID-19 chest CT imaging is very high among symptomatic individuals at high risk, especially using thin-section chest CT. The most common CT features in patients affected by COVID-19 included GGO and consolidation involving the bilateral lungs in a peripheral distribution.","text_body":"Our systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that the proportion of COVID-19 detected by chest CT imaging is very high. The most typical CT imaging finding is GGO. Other common CT features in patients affected by COVID-19 included consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, adjacent pleura thickening, and air bronchograms. More than half of the patients manifested as GGO, consolidation and adjacent pleura thickening. Imaging findings mostly involved the bilateral lungs and were located in the peripheral area of the lungs. The infection can involve all the lobes, and mostly the bilateral lower lobes.\nSome patients who had negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 at initial presentation may still show chest CT abnormalities [19] . Fang et al reported that the sensitivity of first RT-PCR is 71%, which may be lower than that of chest CT [20] . In our meta-analysis of 2738 cases, the pooled positive rate of CT imaging was 89.76% among patients suspected to have COVID-19.\nThus, chest CT plays an important role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19.\nIn this analysis, we found that the typical CT features of COVID-19 are GGO and lung consolidation. Some of the GGO were further developed into reticular interlobular septa thickening and \"crazy paving pattern\", indicating that the infection leads to diffuse alveolar edema and interstitial inflammatory [21, 22] . Several patients appeared to have pleural effusion, which may represent a poor prognostic indicator [23] . Generally, viral pneumonias have similar etiological mechanisms and typical imaging findings of COVID-19. Thus, these findings also appear in other viral pneumonia such as the common cold, influenza, and other coronaviruses diseases including SARS and MERS [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .\nSince COVID-19, SARS and MERS all belong to family of coronaviruses, the CT imaging signs are more similar. Still, there appear to be unique imaging characteristics for COVID-19. Unilateral involvement is more common in the early stage of SARS and MERS [29, 30] . In contrast, COVID-19 infection appears to be more commonly bilateral. In this meta-analysis, most patients had bilateral lung involvement, especially the bilateral lower lobes. Overall, 70% of patients had 3 or more lobes involved.\nOur meta-analysis has several strengths. First, the number of cases included was relatively large for 3 months of early publications, providing aggregate evidence for evaluating diagnosis of COVID-19 by chest CT. Second, the included studies were conducted in different hospitals and settings, making the results more generalizable.\nThird, in this analysis, we extract varieties of different imaging features, including both specific imaging features and distribution patterns in the lungs.\nOur meta-analysis also has several limitations. First a majority of the studies included did not distinguish between clinically mild, moderate, and severe patients.\nFurthermore, some patients may have co-morbidities and chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension that we cannot account for. These factors may be affect imaging appearances. Second, due to different CT scanners and interpreting radiologists, the reported imaging features may be variable across sites. Due to the proportion of COVID-19 detected by chest CT imaging is very high, especially thin chest CT plays a huge role in assisting diagnosis and follow-up treatment in clinical application.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-25","authors_x":"Bao, Cuiping; Liu, Xuehuan; Zhang, Han; Li, Yiming; Liu, Jun","journal_x":"Journal of the American College of Radiology","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.jacr.2020.03.006","H index_x":48.0,"section":"Discussion","total_rank":0.1094771242,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[3040],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["analysi","analysi","analysi","analysi","analysi","analysi","analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],["systematic review "],["meta-analysis","meta-analysis","meta-analysis","meta-analysis","meta-analysis"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"65486f9ea230a303f0af4a0bc0a9e66e3e7629d8","title_x":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract_x":"Background Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (\u226518 years old) with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1\u00b710, 95% CI 1\u00b703-1\u00b717, per year increase; p=0\u00b70043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5\u00b765, 2\u00b761-12\u00b723; p<0\u00b70001), and d-dimer greater than 1 \u00b5g\/mL (18\u00b742, 2\u00b764-128\u00b755; p=0\u00b70033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20\u00b70 days (IQR 17\u00b70-24\u00b70) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n Interpretation The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 \u00b5g\/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.","text_body":"In December, 2019, Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China, became the centre of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (\u226518 years old) with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1\u00b710, 95% CI 1\u00b703-1\u00b717, per year increase; p=0\u00b70043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5\u00b765, 2\u00b761-12\u00b723; p<0\u00b70001), and d-dimer greater than 1 \u00b5g\/mL (18\u00b742, 2\u00b764-128\u00b755; p=0\u00b70033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20\u00b70 days (IQR 17\u00b70-24\u00b70) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n Interpretation The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 \u00b5g\/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.","text_body":"813 adult patients were hospitalised in Jinyintan Hospital or Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital with COVID-19 before Jan 31, 2020. After excluding 613 patients that were still hospitalised or not confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection as of Jan 31, 2020, and nine inpatients without available key information in their medical records, we included 191 inpatients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) in the final analysis. 54 patients died during hospitalisation and 137 were discharged. The median age of the 191 patients was 56\u00b70 years (IQR 46\u00b70-67\u00b70), ranging from 18 years to 87 years, and most patients were male (table 1) . Co morbidities were present in nearly half of patients, with hypertension being the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease (table 1). The most common symptoms on admission were fever and cough, followed by sputum production and fatigue (table 1) . Lymphocytopenia occurred in 77 (40%) patients. 181 (95%) patients received antibiotics and 41 (21%) received antivirals (lopinavir\/ritonavir; table 2). Systematic corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin use differed significantly between non-survivors and survivors (table 2). The comparison of characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients from the two hospitals are shown in the appendix (pp 2-4).\nThe median time from illness onset (ie, before admission) to discharge was 22\u00b70 days (IQR 18\u00b70-25\u00b70), whereas the median time to death was 18\u00b75 days (15\u00b70-22\u00b70; table 2). 32 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom 31 (97%) died. The median time from illness onset to invasive mechanical ventilation was 14\u00b75 days (12\u00b70-19\u00b70). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used in three patients, none of whom survived. Sepsis was the most frequently observed complication, followed by respiratory failure, ARDS, heart failure, and septic shock (table 2). Half of non-survivors experienced a secondary infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in ten (31%) of 32 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The frequency of complications were higher in non-survivors than survivors (table 2) . In univariable analysis, odds of in-hospital death was higher in patients with diabetes or coronary heart disease (table 3) . Age, lymphopenia, leucocytosis, and elevated ALT, lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, IL-6, prothrombin time, creatinine, and procalcitonin were also associated with death (table 3) .\nWe included 171 patients with complete data for all variables (53 non-survivors and 118 survivors) in the multivariable logistic regression model. We found that older age, higher SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg\/mL at admission were associated with increased odds of death (table 3) . When adjusting for study centre, our generalised linear model showed similar results (appendix p 5).\nFor survivors, the median duration of viral shedding was 20\u00b70 days (IQR 17\u00b70-24\u00b70) from illness onset, but the virus was continuously detectable until death in nonsurvivors (table 2; figure 1 ). The shortest observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was 8 days, whereas the longest was 37 days. Among 29 patients who received lopinavir\/ritonavir and were discharged, the median time from illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment was 14\u00b70 days (IQR 10\u00b70-17\u00b70) and the median duration of viral shedding was 22\u00b70 days (18\u00b70-24\u00b70). The median duration of viral shedding was 19\u00b70 days (17\u00b70-22\u00b70) in patients with severe disease status and 24\u00b70 days (22\u00b70-30\u00b70) in patients with critical disease status.\nMajor laboratory markers were tracked from illness onset (figure 2). Baseline lymphocyte count was significantly higher in survivors than non-survivors; in survivors, lymphocyte count was lowest on day 7 after illness onset and improved during hospitalisation, whereas severe lymphopenia was observed until death in non-survivors. Levels of d-dimer, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and IL-6 were clearly elevated in non-survivors compared with survivors throughout the clinical course, and increased with illness deterioration (figure 2). In non-survivors, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I increased rapidly from day 16 after disease onset, whereas lactate dehydrogenase increased for both survivors and non-survivors in the early stage of illness, but decreased from day 13 for survivors.\nMedian time from illness onset to dyspnoea was similar in survivors and non-survivors, with a median duration of dyspnoea of 13\u00b70 days (9\u00b70-16\u00b75) for survivors (table 2; figure 1 ). In survivors, the median duration of fever was 12\u00b70 days (8\u00b70-13\u00b70) and cough persisted for 19\u00b70 days (IQR 12\u00b70-23\u00b70; figure 1 ). 62 (45%) survivors still had cough on discharge and 39 (72%) non-survivors still had cough at the time of death. The dynamic profiles of fever, cough, and dyspnoea are shown in the appendix (p 6). Sepsis developed at a median of 9\u00b70 days (7\u00b70-13\u00b70) after illness onset among all patients, followed by ARDS (12\u00b70 days [8\u00b70-15\u00b70]), acute cardiac injury (15\u00b70 days [10\u00b70-17\u00b70]), acute kidney injury (15\u00b70 days [13\u00b70-19\u00b75]), and secondary infection (17\u00b70 days [13\u00b70-19\u00b70]). The initiation time and duration of systematic corticosteroid use was also similar between the two groups. Among non-survivors, the median time from illness onset was 10\u00b70 days (7\u00b70-14\u00b70) to sepsis, 12\u00b70 days (8\u00b70-15\u00b70) to ARDS, 14\u00b75 days (9\u00b75-17\u00b70) to acute cardiac injury, and ;  table 2 ). Among survivors, secondary infection, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury were observed in one patient each, occurring 9 days (acute kidney injury), 14 days (secondary infection), and 21 days (acute cardiac injury) after illness onset. The median time from dyspnoea to intubation was 10\u00b70 days (IQR 5\u00b70-12\u00b75) for patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation and the time from invasive mechanical ventilation to occurrence of ventilatorassociated pneumonia was 8\u00b70 days (2\u00b70-9\u00b70; figure 1 ).","publish_time_x":"2020-04-03","authors_x":"Zhou, Fei; Yu, Ting; Du, Ronghui; Fan, Guohui; Liu, Ying; Liu, Zhibo; Xiang, Jie; Wang, Yeming; Song, Bin; Gu, Xiaoying; Guan, Lulu; Wei, Yuan; Li, Hui; Wu, Xudong; Xu, Jiuyang; Tu, Shengjin; Zhang, Yi; Chen, Hua; Cao, Bin","journal_x":"The Lancet","doi_x":"10.1016\/s0140-6736(20)30566-3","H index_x":700.0,"section":"Results","total_rank":0.0604444444,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[770,2251],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":2,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],["profil"],[],[],[],["surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv"],[],[],[],[],["logistic regression"],[],[],[],[],[],[],["model","model"],[],[],[],["analysi","analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],["duration","duration","duration","duration","duration","duration","duration"],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","Age","age","age"],[],[],[],[],["shedd","shedd","shedd","shedd"],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"e900ce0bad63d74ff930c7ece62058a0b7ebc03f","title_x":"Working through the COVID-19 outbreak: Rapid review and recommendations for MSK and allied heath personnel","abstract_x":"The coronavirus pandemic has caused the world to undergo unprecedented change in a short space of time.

However, Huang and colleagues' report mainly focused on non-pregnant adults. The clinical characteristics and vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women is unknown. Urgent questions that need to be addressed promptly include whether pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia will develop distinct symptoms from non-pregnant adults, whether pregnant women who have confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia are more likely to die of the infection or to undergo preterm labour, and whether COVID-19 could spread vertically and pose risks to the fetus and neonate. Answers to these questions are essential for formulating the principles of obstetric treatment for pregnant women with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, to facilitate efforts, both in China and glo bally, to prevent and control COVID-19 pneumonia in children and pregnant women, 3 we retrospectively collected and analysed detailed clinical data from pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.

Cord blood and neonatal throat swab samples were collected immediately after delivery in the operating room. Additionally, breast milk samples from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were collected after their first lactation. Evidence of vertical transmission was evaluated by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in these clinical samples. Sample collection was successful in six cases (patients 2, 4-6, 8, and 9). Among the three patients from whom sample collection was not suc cessful, patient 1 was diagnosed after caesarean section, thus no sample was obtained. Patients 3 and 7 underwent caesarean section at night, thus immediate sample collection was not possible.

The clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 infection during pregnancy were similar to those of non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 infection, as previously reported. 2 None of the nine patients developed severe pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Notably, based on our findings in these nine patients, there is currently no evidence to s uggest that development of COVID-19 pneumonia in the third trimester of pregnancy could lead to the occurrence of severe Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia, because they are at an immunosuppressive state, and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy (eg, diaphragm elevation, increased oxygen consumption, and oedema of respiratory tract mucosa) can render them intolerant to hypoxia. For example, the 1918 influenza pandemic caused a mortality rate of 2\u00b76% in the overall population, but 37% among pregnant women. 8 Pregnant women were reported to be at an increased risk of complications from the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection, and were more than four times more likely to be admitted to hospital than the general population (relative risk 4\u00b73 [95% CI 2\u00b73-7\u00b78]). 9 Wong and colleagues 10 also reported that around 50% of pregnant women who developed SARS were admitted to the intensive care unit, around 33% of pregnant women with SARS required mechanical ventilation, and the mortality rate was as high as 25% for these women. In the current study, we treated nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in 11 days from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Considering that SARS-CoV-2 has up to 85% sequence similarity with SARS, [11] [12] [13] [14] although none of our patients developed severe pneumonia or died of COVID-19 infection, we should be alert to the possibility that the disease course and prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia could follow the same trend as SARS in pregnant women. However, our obser vations are based on a small number of cases and the time between illness onset and delivery was short.\nAccording to our study, pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a similar pattern of clinical characteristics to non-pregnant adult patients, as recently reported. 2, 15 Common symptoms at the onset of COVID-19 pneumonia for these women included a fever and cough, whereas less common symptoms were myalgia, malaise, sore throat, diarrhoea, and shortness of breath. Laboratory tests indicated that lymphopenia is also likely to occur. Additionally, increased concentrations However, none of these symptoms was present in every patient, nor were the symptoms specific to pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. By contrast, chest CT might have a high diagnostic value because of its typical images of virus infection, high accuracy with a low false negative rate, and time efficiency. Therefore, we recommend that, in addition to using nucleic acid tests as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, relevant clinical examinations are done, including blood counts and chest CT and a comprehensive evaluation of a patient's medical history, epidemiological exposure, and symptoms. All nine pregnant women in this study underwent a caesarean section. Indications for a caesarean section included severe pre-eclampsia, a history of caesarean sections, and fetal distress. Importantly, uncertainty about the risk of intrapartum mother-to-child transmission by vaginal delivery was another reason for carrying out caesarean sections. Four of the nine patients had preterm labour. However, the causes of premature birth were not related to COVID-19 pneumonia: one patient had severe pre-eclampsia, one had a history of two stillbirths, one had a history of two caesarean sections and irregular contractions; and one had premature rupture of the membrane for about 12 h and suspected intrauterine infection. Moreover, one neonate in our study had a birthweight of 1880 g at 36 gestational weeks plus 2 days, and this case was complicated by preeclampsia. Furthermore, the time period from onset of COVID-19 pneumonia to admission was only 3 days for this patient; therefore we reasoned that the fetal intrauterine growth restriction was more likely to be a symptom associated with pre-eclampsia. Importantly, all nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and 5-min Apgar score of 9-10. One infant had a mild increase in myocardial enzymes on the day of birth, but without any clinical symptoms. None of the neonates needed special paediatric treatment.\nThe main focus of this study was to investigate the possibility of intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 infection. We chose to test amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples at birth to ascertain the possibility of intrauterine fetal infection. Notably, all the samples tested in our study were collected in the operating room at the time of the caesarean section, thus guaranteeing that the samples were not contaminated and best represented fetal intrauterine conditions. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 was negative in all of the above samples, suggesting that no intrauterine fetal infections occurred as a result of COVID-19 infection during a late stage of pregnancy. Our findings are in accordance with what was observed in SARS, which has a similar sequence to SARS-CoV-2. 14 Previous studies have already shown no evidence of perinatal SARS infection among infants born to mothers who developed SARS infection during pregnancy. 10, 16 However, our observation of no fetal infection caused by intrauterine vertical transmission could be affected by our small sample size and the stage of pregnancy at the onset of COVID-19 infection. All patients in the study were recruited in their third trimester, so we were unable to ascertain the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission during the first or second trimester. For example, rubella infection in the first trimester can affect more than 50% of fetuses via intrauterine infection, whereas by the end of the second trimester the incidence rate is reduced by half. 17 We did not collect samples of vaginal mucosa or shedding in birth canals, which prevented us from analysing whether COVID-19 could be transmitted during vaginal delivery. Notably, however, our results showed that breastmilk samples from mothers with COVID-19 infection appeared to be free from SARS-CoV-2.\nOn Feb 6, 2020, a neonate born to a pregnant woman with COVID-19 pneumonia tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection 36 h after birth. 18, 19 Although many important clinical details of this single case were not available at the time of writing this report, there are reasonable concerns that COVID-19 could be contracted in the womb. Reportedly, the pregnant woman had developed fever for 8 h and was suspected to have COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of her typical chest CT image before admission; an emergency caesarean section was subsequently done, which was followed by confirmation of COVID-19 pneumonia. Moreover, the neonate's throat swab sample was collected approximately 30 h after birth, thus providing no direct evidence for intrauterine infection. Additionally, no direct testing of intrauterine tissue samples such as amniotic fluid, cord blood, or placenta was done to confirm that the COVID-19 infection in the neonate was due to intrauterine transmission. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether or not intrauterine COVID-19 infection occurred in this particular case. Nonetheless, this single case of an infected neonate suggests that we should pay special attention to prevent infections in newborn babies born to mothers with COVID-19 pneumonia.\nThis study is limited by the small sample size and retrospective method. Several considerations should be taken into account when interpreting the findings. First, all enrolled patients were in the third trimester. The effect of COVID-19 infection on the fetus in the first or second trimester of pregnancy remains to be clarified. Second, whether vaginal delivery increases the risk of mother-to-child intrapartum transmission, and whether uterine contraction could increase the possibility of the virus ascending, needs to be further investigated. Third, the risk of infection in pregnant women and the effects of the time or mode of delivery on pregnancy outcomes were not evaluated. Fourth, whether COVID-19 could damage the placenta, which represents an important link in vertical transmission, also needs to be further investigated. Future investigations of these issues and follow-up studies of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, as well as neonates, will be necessary to ascertain the safety and health of mothers and babies exposed to SARS-CoV-2.\nIn summary, the symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were diverse, with the main symptoms being fever and cough. We found no evidence for vertical transmission in late pregnancy. Considering the significance of this ongoing global public health emergency, although our conclusions are limited by the small sample size, we believe that the findings reported here are important for understanding the clinical characteristics and vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-13","authors_x":"Chen, Huijun; Guo, Juanjuan; Wang, Chen; Luo, Fan; Yu, Xuechen; Zhang, Wei; Li, Jiafu; Zhao, Dongchi; Xu, Dan; Gong, Qing; Liao, Jing; Yang, Huixia; Hou, Wei; Zhang, Yuanzhen","journal_x":"The Lancet","doi_x":"10.1016\/s0140-6736(20)30360-3","H index_x":700.0,"section":"Discussion","total_rank":0.0647975078,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[34,173,212,523,572,753,1012,1030,1351,1441,1596,1993,2156,2255,2708,3243,5289,5552,5722,6503,6817,8029,8314,8380,8634,8821,8975,9291],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":38,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":true,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["investigati"],[],[],[],[],["analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk","risk","risk","risk"],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],["health","health"],[],["shedd"],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"0f15655bda78c3a62a03a19d8028f8f5cf5a1ef5","title_x":"Clinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical records","abstract_x":"Background Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n , sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1\u00b70 \u00d7 10\u2079 cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9-10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n Interpretation The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.","text_body":"YZ, WH, and HY made substantial contributions to the study concept and design.

One possible answer is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses. ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and\/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths. ADE also requires prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes, presumably circulating in local viruses, making it a possible explanation for the observed geographic limitation of severe cases and deaths.","text_body":"There are numerous questions regarding the nature of the current COVID-19 epidemic. One of the most perplexing happens to be the significant discrepancy of serious cases and deaths between areas within the Hubei Province, where the outbreak initiated, and the rest of the world.\nAn examination of patient cases within the Hubei region reveals some useful data regarding the pathogenesis of this virus [1e3] . Severe cases tend to occur in men and many suffer from one or more co-morbidities such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as well as diabetes. Several sequelae also have been observed including cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia injury, hepatic and kidney injury, and secondary bacterial infection. In the majority of cases of severe disease and death, lymphopenia and sustained inflammation has been recorded. Notably, these observations in COVID-19 patients are similar to those who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic [4] .\nBased on this information and the similarity of symptoms to SARS, COVID-19 appears to constitute a major threat to human health justifying the World Health Organization's declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Yet, examining the situation outside of Hubei Province provides a very different perspective. Most infected individuals have a mild disease and do not progress into severe stages of infection. Moreover, patients appear to be able to recover with little to no medical intervention. Based on this evidence, the virus would not be considered a major threat to public health. Instead, it appears to be no more concerning than the influenza virus [5] .\nThis geographic discrepancy in pathogenesis may appear to defy explanation. Yet there may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly. Individuals suffering the most may have been primed by one or more prior coronavirus exposures, and due to antigenic epitope heterogeneity, are experiencing the effects of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE).\nThis postulate isn't novel as it has been found and characterized in the SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV. Enhancement was identified by Yang et al. [6] in 2005 and was hypothesized as being the reason for such a high mortality rate in China [7] . At the time, the priming strains were thought to be human coronaviruses known to cause mild infection such as 229E [7] . The mechanism was characterized by Yip et al. [8, 9] and revealed that anti-Spike protein antibodies were indeed responsible for the infection of immune cells. Wang et al. [10] revealed that enhancement may be improved by increasing dilutions of antibodies, suggesting a temporal relationship between priming and enhancement.\nWhile the molecular and immunological host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been fully elucidated to confirm ADE is occuring, the current clinical evidence suggests this is a possibility. Based on previous studies using SARS-CoV using in vitro studies [11] and mouse models [12] , ADE hinders the ability to manage inflammation in the lung and elsewhere. This may lead to acute respiratory injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other observed inflammation-based sequelae as seen in many of the documented cases of severe COVID-19 disease. In addition, ADE E-mail address: jason@jasontetro.com. In the context of identifying the priming coronavirus, it is worthwhile looking at SARS-CoV as its introduction to humans has been suggested to have occurred in the Hubei Province [13] . The genetic sequence possesses numerous dissimilarities to the virus responsible for COVID-19, tentatively named SARS-CoV-2 [14] , with approximately 79% homology [15] . For example, Hua et al. [16] identified two specific epitopes on the SARS-CoV spike protein, 447e458 and 789e799. A BLAST comparison with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 reveals 72.7% and 100% similarity respectively. Several other identified epitopes on the SARS-CoV spike protein [13] do not share perfect alignment with SARS-CoV-2 and may also be involved in ADE.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-31","authors_x":"Tetro, Jason A.","journal_x":"Microbes and Infection","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.micinf.2020.02.006","H index_x":129.0,"section":"","total_rank":0.0925414365,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[553],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["model"],["outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age"],[],[],["health","Health","Health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"d3bf1b40c7c93d6bd6ef2d1769b0e68ed233c18a","title_x":"Brescia Renal COVID Task Force, Management Of Patients On Dialysis And With Kidney Transplant During SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) Pandemic In","abstract_x":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease ) is a major pandemic challenging health care systems around the world. The optimal management of COVID-19 infected patients is still unclear, although the consensus is moving towards the need of a biphasic approach. During the first phase of the disease (from onset of the symptoms up to 7-10 days) viral-induced effects are prominent with the opportunity to institute antiviral therapy. In the second inflammatory phase of the disease, immunosuppressive strategies (for example with glucocorticoids or anti-cytokines drugs)may be considered. This latter stage is characterized by the development of progressive lung involvement with increasing oxygen requirements and occasionally signs of the haemophagocitic syndrome. The management of the disease in patients with kidney disease is even more challenging, especially in those who are immunosuppressed or with severe comorbidities.\n Here we present the therapeutic approach employed in Brescia (Italy) for managing kidney transplant and hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, we provide some clinical and physiopathological background, as well as preliminary outcome data of our cohort, in order to better clarify the pathogenesis of the disease and clinical management.","text_body":"We describe our experience with managing patients with kidney disease during the current COVID-19 pandemic in Brescia City in the Lombardy region of Italy, with particular attention to patients undergoing dialysis and renal transplant patients.\nThe China CDC has recently published the largest COVID-19 case series, which includes 44,672 cases. This study shows an overall mortality rate of 2.3%. Beside age (1.3% mortality in the 50-59 age group, 3.6% in the 60-69 age group, 8% in the 70-79 age group and 14.8% in the \u226580 age group), the main risk factors are the presence of cardiovascular diseases (10.5% mortality), diabetes (7.3% mortality), chronic respiratory diseases (6.3% mortality), high blood pressure (6% mortality) and cancer (5.6% mortality) (1, 2) . In the Lombardy region, however, the disease seems to have much higher mortality rates than reported in China and this led us to investigate factors potentially responsible for this worse outcome (3) . The comorbidities associated with increased mortality during COVID-19 are common in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy with haemodialysis. There is a paucity of data on the risk factors and outcome of COVID-19-positive patients with kidney disease -including those on dialysis or with kidney transplant. These groups of patients are unique in view of their immunosuppressed status. Reports from China suggest a less severe course of the disease in dialysis patients, compared to kidney transplant patients, but also compared to patients without kidney disease.\nCurrently, Brescia and its province is the second largest Italian area affected after Bergamo (5317 cases as of 23 March 2020). A working group consisting of infective disease specialists and intensivists from Lombardy has developed a therapeutic protocol in COVID-19 patients based on disease severity(4). We have adapted this protocol to our dialysis and kidney-transplanted patients.

The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed.\n We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways.","text_body":"The cases reported in many parts of China and the outbreaks involve large settle on surfaces in the environment further infecting people who breathe these particles or touch these places and then touch their body parts.

Also it has been reported that some of the Asian populations are more susceptible to acquire this COVID-19 infection when compared to the other races populations (Xu, 2020) . Following are the protective measures given by WHO Among the viral structure the S protein has a major role in binding of the virus to the host receptor cells. S protein has two subunits which are the S1 receptor-binding subunit and S2 the membrane fusion subunit; where the earlier one attached itself to the ACE2 receptor of the human host cell and the S2 subunit internalises and creates the membrane fusion among the viral subunit and the ACE2 receptors. This leads to the release of the viral RNA into the host cell and results into respiratory infection.\nPossible mechanism of action of SARS-COV-2 Fig.2 : Depiction of the binding of SARS-COV-2 to its receptor ACE-2. The S1 and S2 subunits are subsequently cleaved followed by the shedding of ACE-2 by ADAM 17. This resulting in an increased amount of Angiotensin II leading to respiratory distress. Upon binding, the virus fuses with the membrane and enters the cell, followed by translation, and replication of the proteins. ORF3a, ORF8b,E proteins and the NF-KB pathway activates the inflammasome pathway through various means, leading to the activation of cytokine. This results in a cytokine storm, further resulting in respiratory distress.

Further it reaches the whole brain via Blood Brain Barrier and CSF via Blood-CSF barrier in < 7 days. The possible entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the Brain and CNS is important to design effective antiviral drugs. Effective drugs that may cross Blood Brain Barrier and Blood CSF barrier may be taken in to consideration while designing and this could be a promising in treatment strategies.","publish_time_x":"2020-04-04","authors_x":"Vellingiri, Balachandar; Jayaramayya, Kaavya; Iyer, Mahalaxmi; Narayanasamy, Arul; Govindasamy, Vivekanandhan; Giridharan, Bupesh; Ganesan, Singaravelu; Venugopal, Anila; Venkatesan, Dhivya; Ganesan, Harsha; Rajagopalan, Kamarajan; Rahman, Pattanathu K.S.M.; Cho, Ssang-Goo; Kumar, Nachimuthu Senthil; Subramaniam, Mohana Devi","journal_x":"Science of The Total Environment","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2020.138277","H index_x":null,"section":"Recommendations","total_rank":0.1456102784,"risk_factors":["diabetes","pregnancy"],"match_indices":[476,549],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":1,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["shedd"],[],[],[],["factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"026f91ab18b56191f0bd6155bdca07777aaf7167","title_x":"On the frontline against COVID-19: Community pharmacists' contribution during a public health crisis","abstract_x":"The global spread of COVID-19 is placing unprecedented demands on healthcare services.

Studies involving patients with chronic medical conditions who were affected by Hurricane Katrina have reported negative impacts of this natural disaster on medication adherence. 38, 39 For example, a study involving a geographically representative sample of Hurricane Katrina survivors with chronic medical conditions found that one fifth of participants reported cutting back or terminating their medication intake following the disaster for a variety of reasons including limited access to physicians and medications, as well as financial\/insurancerelated problems. 39 This was more commonly reported in patients with conditions that can be temporarily asymptomatic if treatment is disrupted (e.g. diabetes).\nAlthough COVID-19 is a pandemic as opposed to a natural disaster, it too is creating challenges for patients in terms of its impact on normal day-to-day routines (e.g. through social distancing and self-isolation requirements), employment and access to healthcare services which will ultimately create new barriers to medication adherence. Community pharmacists have an important role to play in promoting medication adherence through the provision of evidence-based interventions. 40, 41 However, income losses in particular may affect patients' abilities to continue to pay for their medications. Current medication reimbursement policies should be re-examined in light of the acute income losses faced by many individuals whose jobs have either been lost or are now under threat. For example, access to medication on public health schemes may need to be increased and prescription copayments for patients who obtain their medications on such schemes may need to be reconsidered as these can also negatively impact on medication adherence. 42","publish_time_x":"2020-03-31","authors_x":"Cadogan, Cathal A.; Hughes, Carmel M.","journal_x":"Research in Social and Administrative Pharmacy","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.sapharm.2020.03.015","H index_x":37.0,"section":"Promoting continued medication adherence","total_rank":0.2055214724,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[1044],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],["surviv"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],["asymptomatic"],[],[],[],[],[],[],["health","health","health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"9e79c42bd7bcbc8b2fd2ba494815e3df517774a5","title_x":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the use of MS disease-modifying therapies","abstract_x":"Maria was distraught after reading about the 'potential' epidemic, yet to happen, and the horror stories on Facebook needing reassurance and certainty about what she should do. She requested an urgent appointment to review her treatment plan. Maria was a 26-year-old woman with relapsing multiple sclerosis who had recently experienced brainstem relapse with double vision and ataxia despite treatment with pegylated interferon-beta for the last 18 months. A brain MRI performed one month prior had shown 16 new T2 lesions, four of which were enhancing. One of the enhancing lesions was at the pontomedullary junction and was certainly the cause of her relapse. Treatment was to be escalated to ocrelizumab with the first dose in a week's time. In view of the emerging coronavirus pandemic, she was questioning whether or not she should go ahead with ocrelizumab. This was despite only a handful of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country and none in her town and region.\n If this scenario sounds plausible what should neurologists do? Human coronaviruses are predominantly associated with respiratory tract infections and includes those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and now the COVID-19 pandemic.\n In an uncertain world, where we do not have a clear evidence-base, you often have to default to scientific principles, rather than using the wisdom of the crowd. Not surprising, with Italy being one of the epicentres of the COVID-19 epidemic, the Italian society of neurology or SIN (Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Neurologia) broke cover first producing recommendations on the management of patients with MS during the COVID-19 epidemic (see Box 1). The SIN guidelines provide relatively straightforward, and one could argue arbitrary, advice on how to manage patients with MS in the short-term, but do not address supervision of these patients in the intermediate or long-term especially those with highly active MS. If the public health measures being taken flatten the peak of the epidemic, but extend its tail, the problem of community-acquired SARS-CoV2 infection and COVID-19 may be with us for many months and potentially years. Are the SIN guidelines compatible with the best interests of our patients or a knee-jerk response to an undefined problem that may not be a problem at all?","text_body":"It is clear that COVID-19 is a pandemic and global health crisis with the potential to kill millions of people, particularly the elderly and people with comorbidities such as hypertension, smoking and lung disease. At present we do not know if people with MS are at increased risk acquring SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 or developing severe COVID-19. Individuals with MS are not unique in their requirement to be treated with immunosuppressive therapies. We discussed the COVID-19 epidemic with our renal transplant team who informed us that at present they are not taking any specific action about the levels of immunosuppression for their transplant patients during the epidemic. Basic measures are recommended namely: to improve hand and home hygiene, to avoid highrisk travel and unnecessary contacts, to self-isolate if necessary and to reduce contact with the hospital and other medical institutions as much as possible, because they are more likely to be sources of COVID-19. It is business as usual. Nor are they necessarily halting their transplant programme. Their argument is that transplanted kidneys and other transplanted organs are too precious not to protect them with relevant immunosuppressive drugs. Why would we not have the same attitude about the brains and spinal cords of our patients with active multiple sclerosis?\nWe could argue that solid-organ transplant patients are significantly more immunocompromised than pwMS on disease modifying treatment (DMT). Most transplant patients are on triple immunotherapy, compared to pwMS who are on monotherapy and even then, the level of immunosuppression is generally low. Hence, the mortality\/morbidity risk to an individual on a DMT, infected with COVID-19, may be actually quite moderate to low. Another hypothesis being considered is that moderate immunosuppression may prevent severe complications associated with COVID-19 infection. The severe pulmonary complications of COVID-19 infection are consistent with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) caused by an over-exuberant immune response to the virus (Ramanathan et al., 2020) . As a result, several exploratory trials are currently being undertaken in China and elsewhere using immunosuppressants to try and dampen the immune response to the virus. Interestingly, fingolimod, a S1P modulator licensed for MS, is being tested as a treatment for COVID-19 associated ARDS (continued on next page) G. Giovannoni, et al. Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders xxx (xxxx) xxxx (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04280588). Interferon beta is also being trialled in COVID-19 based on its antiviral properties (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04276688). Then there is the virology to take into account. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is a new human pathogen that is likely to have recently crossed species (Andersen et al., 2020) . COVID-19 will eventually become endemic and hence pose a seasonal risk to patients on immunosuppressive therapies. As it is a small RNA virus with low fidelity it is likely to mutate rapidly making a one-off vaccine only a partial solution. Vaccines take time to be developed, tested and introduced at a population level. Delaying treatment, de-escalating therapy by switching to immunomodulatory DMTs, such as interferonbeta, glatiramer acetate or teriflunomide, or interrupting dosing of DMTs to wait for a vaccine will delay the adequate treatment of MS, especially as it may take 12-18 months to develop a vaccine. We, therefore, need a pragmatic response on management of the potential threat of COVID-19 in individuals with MS. If patients have active MS they need to be treated based on the clinical evidence at hand and hence may need to be treated with higher efficacy DMTs. This should be implemented in conjunction with appropriate behavioural modifications to reduce or ideally prevent exposure to the virus.\nIt is essential to consider the potential risk of morbidity and possible mortality for each MS patient, who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and develops COVID-19. The individual's risk profile is multifactorial; their DMT and consequent immune response is one of the factors. Other aspects to consider, when assessing a respiratory viral infection include: smoking practices (increased cigarette smoking increases risk); ambulatory status (less mobility increases risk, especially if the patient is in a wheelchair); age (increasing age increases risk); weight (increasing weight impacts on ambulation and respiratory function); underlying respiratory illnesses, such as asthma or COPD. Also, the frequency of necessary attendance at a hospital or healthcare facility for laboratory or MRI testing, but also for infusions may place the patient at a higher risk of exposure. In the context of these factors the health care professionals should weigh the potential risks of SARS-CoV-1 exposure and manage their DMT accordingly. Visits for MS care should preferably be done by telemedicine or phone.\nThe potential hazards posed by each DMT differ and, rather than imposing a blanket rule, decisions regarding treatment should be individualised (See Table 1 ) and discussed with patients. For some patients having their MS treated and controlled may be more important than the potential danger of being exposed to and acquiring a more severe COVID-19 infection. Table 1 is our attempt to define the risks associated with the different classes of DMTs in the event of a patient acquiring a COVID-19 infection.\nAssuming that antiviral responses are driven mainly by T-cells, in particular CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and natural-killer cells and less so, at least initially, by B-cells, allows one to construct a hierarchy of immunosuppression of DMTs. The highest risk are the immune reconstitution therapies during the depletion phase of the treatment, i.e. haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), mitoxantrone (Novantrone) and cladribine (Mavenclad). After immune reconstitution, once the total lymphocyte counts have returned to normal or near normal the risk of severe viral infections are probably no higher than expected for the background population and would be associated with age and other comorbidities. Please note, immune reconstitution takes months to years, so if the patient's last course of treatment was in the previous 6-12 months they may still be immunocompromised. A total lymphocyte count less 1.1 \u00d7 10 9 \/L or 1100\/ mm 3 is associated with an increased risk of infection and infection-related mortality (Warny et al., 2018) . This risk increases progressively the lower the absolute lymphocyte counts; particularly when the lymphocyte count drops below 800\/mm 3 (>50% risk) (Warny et al., 2018) . As a rough guide, pwMS with a lymphocyte count above 800\/mm 3 (WHO grade 2) are able to deal with viral infections reasonably well provided they have no other comorbidities and are relatively young. Of the immune reconstitution therapies, cladribine (Mavenclad) is classed as intermediate risk, because it is a relatively poor T-cell depleting agent (Stuve et al., 2019) . T-cells are only depleted post-cladribine by an average of 50% with the CD4+ population being more sensitive than the CD8+ population. In the phase 3 CLARITY study, viral infections were uncommon post-cladribine and apart from herpes zoster, infections were no more frequent in cladribine-treated subjects compared to placebo (Cook et al., 2011) . When viral infections occurred post-cladribine they tended to be mild or moderate in severity. Similarly, anti-CD20 therapies such as ocrelizumab have a minor impact on T-cell counts and are not associated with severe viral infections (Mayer et al., 2019) . In the phase 3 relapsing-remitting and primary progressive trials, infections were slightly more frequent on ocrelizumab compared to comparator arms (interferon-beta-1a or placebo) Montalban et al., 2017) . Most of these infections were mild and moderate with the severe infections being bacterial in nature (pneumonia, urinary tract infections and cellulitis). We therefore feel that both cladribine and anti-CD20 therapies are relatively safe to use during the COVID-19 pandemic based on their profiles defined in phase 3 trials.\nThe sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) modulators (fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, ponesimod) work by reducing the egress of lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs into the circulation (Stepanovska and Huwiler, 2019) . The actual degree of lymphopaenia is not associated with their efficacy nor the risk of infection (Francis et al., 2014) . Overall infectious complications are relatively low on S1P modulators, with opportunistic infections emerging over time (Epstein et al., 2018; Luna et al., 2019) . Importantly, the vast majority of patients on S1P modulators do not have a problem dealing with community acquired viral infections. Patients on fingolimod who are exposed to and acquire exotic viral infections such as dengue fever seem to deal with them without complications (Fragoso et al., 2016a) . This is why patients on S1P modulators should be at relatively low risk of complications from COVID-19 infection and why it may be safe to continue these treatments during the epidemic. Fingolimod does however blunt vaccine responses (Kappos et al., 2015) indicating that both the priming and effector arms of the immune system are affected, whether this will impact on COVID-19 outcomes is at present unknown.\nAlthough most neurologists consider natalizumab relatively safe there is a small increased risk of upper respiratory tract infections on this medication (Kapoor et al., 2018; Polman et al., 2006; Rudick et al., 2006) and there are theoretical reasons why it may reduce trafficking of lymphocytes in the lung and mucosa (Woodside and Vanderslice, 2008) . It is clear that natalizumab blocks immune surveillance of the CNS, hence a person on natalizumab who develops a COVID-19 encephalitis could be in danger of major complications of this infection. The latter is analogous to PML, which is also a viral encephalitis, and similar to herpes-simplex and varicella -zoster encephalitis resulting from natalizumab exposure (Fine et al., 2013) . Coronaviruses are potentially neurotropic and there has been one online case report of a 56-year old Chinese man developing COVID-19 encephalitis. He developed a decreased level of consciousness with a normal CT scan of the brain. Spinal fluid analysis revealed SARS-CoV-2. He subsequently made a recovery and was discharged (Xinhua, 2020) . There is also clear evidence from the large Chinese cohort that anosmia may be an early sign of COVID-19 infection, suggesting involvement of the neuraxis.\nAnother human coronavirus HCoV-OC43, which is generally associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections, has been shown to have neuroinvasive properties. Studies in mice have shown that HCoV-OC43 can infect neurons and cause encephalitis and cause persistent infections in human neural-cell lines (Arbour et al., 1999) . There are case reports identifying HCoV-OC43 RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid or brain of children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (Yeh et al., 2004) and acute encephalomyelitis (Morfopoulou et al., 2016) . Coronaviruses mutate very rapidly and hence may produce neurotropic strains quite quickly. The latter is a potential issue in the context of natalizumab, which creates an immune privileged site that may allow for the selection of these neurotropic mutants. Another aspect that needs to be considered is what happens in the gut. SARS-CoV-2 infects the gastrointestinal tract, with about 3-4% of people with COVID-19 developing diarrhoea (Guan et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 is shed in the stool (Holshue et al., 2020) . Natalizumab also reduces lymphocyte trafficking to the gut and is a licensed treatment for Crohn's disease (Ghosh et al., 2003) . Will patients on natalizumab and other DMTs have increased viral replication in the gut and shedding in the stool? Will patients on natalizumab and other DMTs infected with the virus become superspreaders? Despite these questions the current science indicates that patients on natalizumab should be able to deal with a novel viral infection such as dengue (Fragoso et al., 2016b) . Reassuringly, five patients on natalizumab infected with dengue virus cleared the virus without complications similar to those on fingolimod (Fragoso et al., 2016b) .\nClearly, any decision to start a DMT during the COVID-19 pandemic will need to be taken carefully and will depend on the state of the COVID-19 pandemic, not only in the particular country concerned, but in the specific area the patient lives and receives therapy. For example, aggressive public health steps to contain the spread of the virus locally may make it relatively safe for a patient to start an immunosuppressive therapy. Our concern is that the COVID-19 pandemic may trigger a large number of neurologists and patients to reconsider treatment strategy and choice of initial DMT and to opt for less effective immunomodulatory DMTs. This change needs to be considered carefully. The COVID-19 pandemic in all likelihood will be short lived and it would be unfair to patients treated during the epidemic to be disadvantaged in the long term regarding the management of their MS. Neurologists have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort to activate the MS community: to advance the principle that 'time is brain', to treat MS proactively to a target of no evident disease activity (NEDA) and more recently, to flip the pyramid and use higher efficacy treatments first line. These treatment principles are evidence-based and should not be thrown out in the context of a potential, but yet undefined, risk to our patients.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-27","authors_x":"Giovannoni, Gavin; Hawkes, Chris; Lechner-Scott, Jeannette; Levy, Michael; Waubant, Emmanuelle; Gold, Julian","journal_x":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.msard.2020.102073","H index_x":25.0,"section":"","total_rank":0.0287859825,"risk_factors":["smoking"],"match_indices":[189,4234,4273],"smoking_count":3,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],["profil","profil"],[],[],["contact","contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk"],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],["health","health","health","health"],[],["shedd"],[],[],[],["factor","factor","factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"2369adf9ae01de1ff19ee2b39c7e253e484d1459","title_x":"Dysregulation of immune response in patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","abstract_x":"were collected and analyzed.

Totally, increase of NLR, and T lymphopenia-in particular, decrease of CD4+ T cells-were common among patients with COVID-19, and more evident in the severe cases, but no significant change in the number of CD8+ cells and B cells. Based on these data, we suggested that COVID-19 might damage lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, and the immune system was impaired during the period of disease.\nIn the cohort, we observed that 44.0% of patients had at least one underlying disorder (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and a higher percentage of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in the severe cases than the mild individuals, in 13 consistent with those reports [5, 12] , suggested that COVID-19 is more likely to infect those elder men with chronic comorbidities due to weaker immune functions.\nIn terms of laboratory tests, we noted that most of infected patients presented lymphopenia and elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers, More interestingly, a higher number of neutrophils and a lower number of lymphocytes, ie, the increase of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), were found in the severe group with COVID-19 compared to the mild group. NLR, a well-known marker of systemic inflammation and infection, has been studied as a predictor of bacterial infection, included pneumonia [13] [14] [15] . The increase of NLR in our study, consistent with the findings from Wang et al that several patients with COVID-19 had a rising neutrophil count and a falling lymphocyte count during the severe phase [12] , indicated that serious disturbance in internal environment and potential critical condition in those severe infected cases.\nHigher serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8) were found in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to individuals with mild disease, similar to the results in SARS and MERS [7, 16] . Cytokines and chemokines have been thought to play an important role in immunity and immunopathology during virus infections [16, 17] . Although there is no direct evidence for the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in lung pathology during COVID-19, the change of laboratory parameters, including elevated serum cytokine, chemokine levels, and increased NLR in infected patients were correlated with the severity of the disease and adverse outcome, suggesting a possible role for hyper-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis.\nVirus-induced direct cytopathic effects and viral evasion of host immune responses are believed to play major roles in disease severity [16, 17] . A rapid and well-coordinated innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infections, however, when immune response is dysregulated, it will result in an excessive inflammation, even cause death [18] . In our study, we demonstrated pronounced lymphopenia and low counts of CD3+ cells and CD4+ cells in COVID-19 cases. The differentiation of na\u00efve CD4+ T-cells into effector and memory subsets is one of the most fundamental facets of T-cell-mediated immunity [19] . And the balance between the na\u00efve and memory CD4+ T cells is crucial for maintaining an efficient immune response. Our results of lymphocyte subsets with higher na\u00efve CD4+ T-cell subpopulations and smaller percentages of memory cells, higher na\u00efve: memory ratio, in severe cases indicated that immune system in severe infection subgroup was impaired more severely. In addition, the decrease of regulatory T cells, especially induced regulatory T cells which have a key role in restraining allergic inflammation at mucosal surfaces, was demonstrated in those infected patients, especially in the severe group. Furthermore, similar tendency was also presented in na\u00efve regulatory T cells, which underlie the control of systemic and tissue specific autoimmunity. It has been shown that T cells, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in weakening or dampening overactive innate immune responses during viral infection [18] . Whereas, regulatory T cells, a subset of T helper cells, play a crucial role in negatively regulating the activation, proliferation, and effector functions of a wide range of immune cells for the maintenance of self-tolerance and immune homeostasis [20, 21] . Given that higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in COVID-19 patients, especially in the severe cases, the consumption of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and the decrease of regulatory T cells, presented in our study, might result in aggravated inflammatory responses, the production of cytokine storm and make damaged tissue worse. Although not so sure, correlative evidence from those severe patients with lower number of lymphocytes suggested a role for dysregulated immune responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis. 15 There were several limitations in our study which might make some potential bias. First, it was a retrospective, single center and small sample study of patients admitted to hospital; standardized data for a larger cohort would be better to assess the temporal change of immune response after infection with COVID-19. Second, those patients with COVID-19 who have bacterial co-infection or superinfection might affect the results of immune response. Most of them presented the increase of NLR and procalcitonin, and more evident in severe cases, indicated potential bacterial co-infection due to dysregulated immune system.\nDespite that, our study demonstrated several novel information about dysregulated immune response in COVID-19 patients that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, induce a cytokine storm in the body, and generate a series of immune responses to damage the corresponding organs; thus, surveillance of NLR and lymphocyte subsets is helpful in the early screening of critical illness, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. 16 ","publish_time_x":"2020-03-12","authors_x":"Qin, Chuan; Zhou, Luoqi; Hu, Ziwei; Zhang, Shuoqi; Yang, Sheng; Tao, Yu; Xie, Cuihong; Ma, Ke; Shang, Ke; Wang, Wei; Tian, Dai-Shi","journal_x":"Clin Infect Dis","doi_x":"10.1093\/cid\/ciaa248","H index_x":null,"section":"Discussion","total_rank":0.0642994242,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[628],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],["range"],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["generat"],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"0dca038ac8dfd45a921b7cd9f1c90a8554799e23","title_x":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract_x":"Background In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.

The ventilator adopted PSIMV mode, the inhaled oxygen concentration was 35-100%, and the positive end expiratory pressure was 6-12 cm H 2 O. All four patients were still using ventilators at data cutoff. Moreover, nine (9%) patients received continuous blood purifi cation due to renal failure and three (3%) patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; table 2).\nBy the end of Jan 25, 31 (31%) patients had been discharged and 11 (11%) patients had died; all other patients were still in hospital (table 1). The first two deaths were a 61yearold man (patient 1) and a 69yearold man (patient 2). They had no previous chronic underlying disease but had a long history of smoking. Patient 1 was transferred to Jinyintan Hospital and diagnosed with severe pneumonia and ARDS. He was immediately admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and given an intubated ventilatorassisted breathing therapy. Later, the patient, having developed severe res piratory failure, heart failure, and sepsis, experienced a sudden cardiac arrest on the 11th day of admission and was declared dead. Patient 2 had severe pneumonia and ARDS after admission. The patient was transferred to the ICU and given ventilatorassisted breathing, and received anti infection and ECMO treatment after admission. The patient's hypoxaemia remained unresolved. On the ninth day of admission, the patient died of severe pneumonia, septic shock, and respiratory failure. The intervals 1 (1A) . The brightness of both lungs was diffusely decreased, showing a large area of patchy shadow with uneven density. Tracheal intubation was seen in the trachea and the heart shadow outline was not clear. The catheter shadow was seen from the right axilla to the mediastinum. Bilateral diaphragmatic surface and costal diaphragmatic angle were not clear, and chest x-ray on Jan 2 showed worse status (1B). Case 2: chest x-ray obtained on Jan 6 (2A). The brightness of both lungs was decreased and multiple patchy shadows were observed; edges were blurred, and large ground-glass opacity and condensation shadows were mainly on the lower right lobe. Tracheal intubation could be seen in the trachea. Heart shadow roughly presents in the normal range. On the left side, the diaphragmatic surface is not clearly displayed. The right side of the diaphragmatic surface was light and smooth and rib phrenic angle was less sharp. Chest x-ray on Jan 10 showed worse status (2B). Case 3: chest CT obtained on Jan 1 (3A) showed mass shadows of high density in both lungs. Bright bronchogram is seen in the lung tissue area of the lesion, which is also called bronchoinflation sign. Chest CT on Jan 15 showed improved status (3B). between the onset of symptoms and the use of ventilator assisted breathing in the two patients were 3 days and 10 days, respectively. The course of the disease and lung lesions progressed rapidly in both patients, with both developing multiple organ failure in a short time. The deaths of these two patients were consistent with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. 8 Of the remaining nine patients who died, eight patients had lymphopenia, seven had bilateral pneumonia, five were older than 60 years, three had hypertension, and one was a heavy smoker.","publish_time_x":"2020-02-21","authors_x":"Chen, Nanshan; Zhou, Min; Dong, Xuan; Qu, Jieming; Gong, Fengyun; Han, Yang; Qiu, Yang; Wang, Jingli; Liu, Ying; Wei, Yuan; Xia, Jia'an; Yu, Ting; Zhang, Xinxin; Zhang, Li","journal_x":"The Lancet","doi_x":"10.1016\/s0140-6736(20)30211-7","H index_x":700.0,"section":"Infection-related biomarkers","total_rank":0.0709812109,"risk_factors":["smoking"],"match_indices":[2202,4798],"smoking_count":2,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["model"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],["range","range"],["duration","duration"],[],["infecti","infecti"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"0dca038ac8dfd45a921b7cd9f1c90a8554799e23","title_x":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract_x":"Background In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.

It presents the latest status of the 2019nCoV infection in China and adds details on combined bacterial and fungal infections.\nHuman coronavirus is one of the main pathogens of respiratory infection. The two highly pathogenic viruses, SARSCoV and MERSCoV, cause severe res piratory syndrome in humans and four other human corona viruses (HCoVOC43, HCoV229E, HCoVNL63, HCoVHKU1) induce mild upper respiratory disease. The major SARSCoV outbreak involving 8422 patients occurred during 2002-03 and spread to 29 countries globally. 9,10 MERSCoV emerged in Middle Eastern countries in 2012 but was imported into China. 11, 12 The sequence of 2019nCoV is relatively different from the six other coronavirus subtypes but can be classified as betacoronavirus. SARSCoV and MERSCoV can be transmitted directly to humans from civets and dromedary camels, respectively, and both viruses origi nate in bats, but the origin of 2019nCoV needs further investigation. [13] [14] [15] 2019nCoV also has enveloped virions that measure approximately 50-200 nm in diameter with a single positivesense RNA genome. 16 Clubshaped glycoprotein spikes in the envelope give the virus a crownlike or coronal appearance. Transmission rates are unknown for 2019nCoV; however, there is evidence of humantohuman transmission. None of the 99 patients we examined were medical staff, but 15 medical workers have been reported with 2019nCoV infection, 14 of whom are assumed to have been infected by the same patient. 17 The mortality of SARSCoV has been reported as more than 10% and MERSCoV at more than 35%. 5, 18 At data cutoff for this study, mortality of the 99 included patients infected by 2019nCoV was 11%, resembling that in a previous study. 3 However, additional deaths might occur in those still hospitalised.\nWe observed a greater number of men than women in the 99 cases of 2019nCoV infection. MERSCoV and SARSCoV have also been found to infect more males than females. 19, 20 The reduced susceptibility of females to viral infections could be attributed to the protection from X chromosome and sex hormones, which play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity. 21 Additionally, about half of patients infected by 2019nCoV had chronic underlying diseases, mainly cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes; this is similar to MERSCoV. 19 Our results suggest that 2019nCoV is more likely to infect older adult males with chronic comorbidities as a result of the weaker immune func tions of these patients. [19] [20] [21] [22] Some patients, especially severely ill ones, had co infections of bacteria and fungi. Common bacterial cultures of patients with secondary infections included A baumannii, K pneumoniae, A flavus, C glabrata, and C albicans. 8 The high drug resistance rate of A baumannii can cause difficulties with antiinfective treatment, leading to higher possibility of developing septic shock. 23 For severe mixed infections, in addition to the virulence factors of pathogens, the host's immune status is also one of the important factors. Old age, obesity, and presence of comorbidity might be associated with increased mor tality. 24 When populations with low immune function, such as older people, diabetics, people with HIV infection, people with longterm use of immuno suppressive agents, and pregnant women, are infected with 2019nCoV, prompt administration of antibiotics to prevent infection and strengthening of immune support treatment might reduce complications and mortality.\nIn terms of laboratory tests, the absolute value of lymphocytes in most patients was reduced. This result suggests that 2019nCoV might mainly act on lympho cytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARSCoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory mucosa and infect other cells, induce a cytokine storm in the body, generate a series of immune responses, and cause changes in peripheral white blood cells and immune cells such as lymphocytes. Some patients progressed rapidly with ARDS and septic shock, which was eventually followed by multiple organ failure. Therefore, early identification and timely treatment of critical cases is of crucial importance. Use of intra venous immunoglobulin is recommended to enhance the ability of antiinfection for severely ill patients and steroids (methylprednisolone 1-2 mg\/kg per day) are recommended for patients with ARDS, for as short a duration of treatment as possible. Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus consumes many immune cells and inhibits the body's cellular immune function. Damage to T lymphocytes might be an important factor leading to exacerbations of patients. 25 The low absolute value of lymphocytes could be used as a reference index in the diagnosis of new coronavirus infections in the clinic.\nIn general, the characteristics of patients who died were in line with the early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia in our previous study: the MuLBSTA score. 8 The MuLBSTA score system contains six indexes, which are multilobular infiltration, lympho penia, bacterial coinfection, smoking history, hyper tension, and age. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019nCoV infection.\nThis study has several limitations. First, only 99 patients with confirmed 2019nCoV were included; suspected but undiagnosed cases were ruled out in the analyses. It would be better to include as many patients as possible in Wuhan, in other cities in China, and even in other countries to get a more comprehensive understanding of 2019nCoV. Second, more detailed patient information, particularly regarding clinical outcomes, was unavailable at the time of analysis; however, the data in this study permit an early assess ment of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019nCoV pneumonia in Wuhan, China.\nIn conclusion, the infection of 2019nCoV was of clustering onset, is more likely to infect older men with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as ARDS.\nContributors NC, XD, FG, YH, YQ, JW, YL, YW, JX, TY, and LZ collected the epidemiological and clinical data and processed statistical data.

Most patients with COVID-19 in China were given empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and many, oseltamivir, because laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 takes time, and distinguishing the disease from other bacterial and viral pneumonias is often difficult. 11-15 One study of 201 patients with COVID-19 found only one co-infection with a different virus and none with bacteria. 24 Another study of 92 patients found six coinfections by other common respiratory viruses, 55 and a third study of 115 patients found five co-infections with influenza. 56 Any empirical antibiotic and anti-influenza therapy should be rapidly de-escalated based on microbiology test results and clinical response.\nChinese reports also show that systemic corticosteroids were administered to approximately half of patients with COVID-19 with severe or critical illness. 12-15,17 A retrospective study of 84 patients with ARDS associated with COVID-19 found lower mortality in those treated with methylprednisolone, but the findings are limited by the observational design of the study, small sample size, and possible confounders. 24 Because COVID-19 might be associated with a cytokine storm like that seen in other viral infections, immunosuppression has been proposed as an approach that might be beneficial for patients with signs of hyperinflammation, such as increasing ferritin concentrations. 57 Although the benefits of immunosuppression are unproven and the role of corticosteroids in COVID-19 remains unclear, a systematic review of observational studies of corticosteroids for SARS found no impact on mortality but possible harms, including avascular necrosis, psychosis, diabetes, and delayed viral clearance. 58 Similarly, an observational study found that corticosteroids for MERS did not affect mortality, but did delay viral clearance. 59 A systematic review of observational studies suggested that cortico steroids might increase mortality and secondary infections in influenza. 60 Until further data are available, the routine use of corticosteroids in viral severe acute respiratory infections, including COVID-19, is not recommended. 61 Rapid liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation to reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and to create ICU capacity must be balanced against the risks of premature extubation (especially without facilitative post-extubation NIV and HFNC) and subsequent re-intubation (and the attendant risks of viral transmission to health-care workers).

While writing this article there are 750,890 affected people globally with 36,405 deaths. 1 India has reported 1238 affected people with 35 deaths 2 . Diabetes has emerged as one of major risk factors for increased mortality 3 . Good glycemic control might help in reducing the disease severity. 4 Many major countries of the world are under 'lockdown' (limiting movements or activities in a community while allowing essential organizations to function) or preparing for one to limit spread of COVID-19. Indian government announced a 21 days nationwide lockdown, starting 25 th March, 2020. 5 Consequences of this lockdown for patients of diabetes could be; absent or less exercise, changes in diet (e.g. e.g. increased snacking, consumption of 'comfort' dense calorie foods), and decreased availability of anti-hyperglycemic agents and\/or insulin.

Telemedicine can help the patients to get in touch with their physician from the comfort of their home, and away from hospitals which could increase chances of coronavirus infections. Physicians can interact with the patient, gather history, analyze their self-monitored blood glucose charts (SMBG) and self-monitored blood pressure (SMBP) values and give advice.\nThe guidelines given by MOHFW 7 suggest video mode of communication for first consult however, in our opinion the first consult for patients with diabetes should ideally be face-to-face if possible, because physical examination cannot be replaced by telemedicine unless another healthcare worker in physical proximity to the patient can relay examination findings.\nScientific studies support the usage of telemedicine in patients of diabetes. A metaanalysis of 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of telemedicine (video, phone and email) from China (involving a pooled population (n,3514) given telemedicine over 3-60 months) was done. This study showed a reduction in HbA1c by -0.37% (p <0.001) in telemedicine group when compared to controls. 11 In a Cochrane review done by Flodgren and colleagues 12 , 21 RCTs of patient with diabetes (n,2768) were analyzed. These patients had interactive telemedicine (remote monitoring or real time video) delivered in addition to, or as an alternative to, or partly substituted for standard care vs. standard care alone. This study showed that there was a reduction of HbA1c by -0.31% (p <0.001) in patients on telemedicine when compared with controls. In a recently published review of 46 studies, which included patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, n, 24000) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM n, 2052), different modes of telemedicine were studied. There was overall mean reduction in HbA1c in telemedicine intervention group in both T1DM (-0.12 to -0.86%) and T2DM (-0.01% to -1.13%) patients. 13 Research on telemedicine and diabetes in India is sparse.

Based on the high-homology between the Spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we hypothesized that past contact with infected dogs shield humans against the circulating SARS-CoV-2. Elseways, the recurrent virus exposure over a short time-lapse might result in the Antibody Dependent Enhancement, triggering the violent immune reaction responsible for the severe clinical outcomes observed in the Hubei province. Nevertheless, further experimental studies are desired for a confidential evaluation of the postulated hypotheses.","text_body":"Since late December 2019, the world is facing a novel outbreak of an infectious disease, known as COVID-19, caused by an unidentified viral agent. Examination of patients cases reports clinical picture comparable to this observed in the SARS outbreak of 2003. This evidence is also supported by the early identification of the etiologic agent as a novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the molecular investigations describing a high percentage of sequence homology between SARS-CoV-2 and the previous SARS-causing virus (SARS-CoV) [1, 2] . Coronaviruses are viruses with single-strand positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kilobases [3] . They have been commonly found in a wide array of host spectrum including avian, camels, bats, masked palm civets, mice, dogs, and cats [2] . Since its early identification, in the very begin of 2020, several nucleotidesbased surveys and sequence homology-based alignments have been carried out with the focus to elucidate the viral origin and delineate cell-and host-tropism of the viral agent on the attempt to guide better management and control of the virus diffusion [4] . Sequence similarity alignments have reported SARS-CoV-2 being highly similar to several wildlife animals such as bats, pangolins and masked palm civets [3] . Controversial results have been reported concerning the snake coronavirus [2, 5] . Nevertheless, the sole investigation of the genetic sequences might result in a biased and\/or incomplete depiction of the virus source, biology and its pathogenetic mechanism [4] . In the Hubei province, where the outbreak originated, severe cases or deaths attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infections are predominantly arising from patients suffering from one or more previous pathological conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease leading to sequelae, sometimes fatal, such as cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia injury, hepatic and kidney injury, and secondary bacterial infection [4, 6] .\nAlthough featured by a higher fatality rate when compared with the virus of the seasonal influenza (3.4%, WHO Situation Report-37, 25\/02\/2020), outside the primordial outbreak site, much less warning clinical signs have been registered in the SARS CoV-2 infected patients manifesting a mild form of the disease that is not evolving into severe stages and can, in some cases, recover without medical intervention [4] . Altogether this suggests the important contribution of the biological mechanisms that cannot be explained by the sole investigation of the genetic sequences.\nProtein repertoire of the coronaviruses consists of four main structural and approximately 16 major non-structural proteins [3, 7] . Among the four structural proteins, the Spike protein (also known as S-protein) is involved in host tropism by means of recognition and attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor exposed in the outer layer of the host cell membrane [8] . A very recent amino acid sequence alignment of ACE2 from different animal species including humans, pets and the major domestic animals highlighted high protein sequence similarity between the tested animal species, suggesting a potential interaction of the viral particles with a wider array of host cells [8] .\nIn accordance with the hypothesis of interspecies transmission of the beta coronaviruses [8] , we performed sequence homology analysis of the aminoacidic sequence of the Spike protein from SARS CoV-2 against taxonomically related coronaviruses with tropism for other animal species. Although the low homology scored while comparing the whole protein sequence (Table 1) , particular interest was dedicated to the canine respiratory coronavirus, the bovine coronavirus revealing and the human enteric coronavirus 36.93%, 38.42% and 37.68% sequence homology to SARS CoV-2 spike protein, respectively.\nA previous study of Hua and colleagues on the amino acid sequence of SARS CoV spike protein identified six epitopes based on the hydrophilicity, surface probability, antigenic index, and secondary structure [9] ( Table 2) .\nThe sequence homology analysis restricted to the epitope sequences of the SARS CoV-2 revealed instead high percentage homology towards taxonomically related coronaviruses. Of these, we retain it is worth of note the high similarity occurring among 4 epitope sequences of canine respiratory coronavirus (Canine respiratory CoV BJ 232) and the circulating SARS CoV-2 (Table 3) .\nHighlighting the similarity at the epitope level opens new avenues in understanding the biological mechanisms undertaken during viral infection. Before the current outbreak, several studies witness the common identification of coronavirus infection in dogs [10, 11] . Previous studies performed by Szczepanski and colleagues report the possibility to grow both bovine and canine coronavirus on human cells lines such as the Human Rectal Tumor cells (HRT-18G) and Human Airway Epithelium (HAE) although featured by a strongly reduced replication efficiency [12, 13] . In this view, a previous \"contact\" with the canine virus might provide at least a partial\/basal immunization that shields humans against the circulating SARS CoV-2. This would partially explain the mild symptoms registered among patients outside the Hubei province and without previous co-morbidities. Accordingly, high similarity percentage have also been observed between SARS CoV-2 spike proteins epitopes and bovine coronavirus, which genome and proteins appear among those included in the patented vaccinal formulation released against coronavirus.\nWith regard to the most severe cases of infection registered both outside and within the Hubei province, it is most likely that these individuals have been primed by one or more coronavirus exposure within a narrow time window, leading to the effects of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) [4] . Such a hypothesis is in line with the previous observations dating back to the previous SARS outcome in 2003 when human coronaviruses, known to cause mild infections, were hypothesized of priming the high mortality scored in China. Here, anti-Spike protein antibodies were indicated as potentially involved in the enhancement mechanism [14e18]. In this view, it is plausible that Hubei province patients are featured by a more severe clinical picture, since more likely to be recurrently exposed to the coronavirus.\nTo summarize, animals have (had) a critical role in this outbreak onset and evolution. Acknowledged their pivotal role as virus reservoir, they might act in the first instance as \"beneficial\" source of immune-stimulating virus particles; thus, providing a shield against the circulating SARS CoV-2. However, the recurrent exposure within a narrow time-lapse might results in the detrimental triggering of violent immune responses and the evolution towards a more severe, or even fatal, clinical picture.\nAbove hypotheses are based on the assumption that sufficient viral titer of the SARS CoV-2 is transmitted from patient to patient [19] . The previous investigation on animal betacoronavirus such as the canine coronavirus have demonstrated a high transmission efficiency through direct contact between infected animals, acknowledged the high viral titers found in the aerosols of respiratory secretions [20] . Novel investigations to assess the transmission rate of the canine respiratory coronavirus to humans are needed to better suit the above hypotheses. Also, care should be taken while evaluating the data on the sole basis of sequence homology and further studies employing purified forms of the spike proteins and\/or its epitopes are desired.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-17","authors_x":"Tilocca, Bruno; Soggiu, Alessio; Musella, Vincenzo; Britti, Domenico; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Urbani, Andrea; Roncada, Paola","journal_x":"Microbes and Infection","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.micinf.2020.03.002","H index_x":129.0,"section":"","total_rank":0.0515384615,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[1798],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact","contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["investigati","investigati","investigati","investigati","investigati"],[],["outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak"],[],[],["analysi","analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"9e97aa5aabcd67bfd4bba5839da70c7b2371a679","title_x":"Journal Pre-proof Is schizophrenia research relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic?","abstract_x":"Schizophrenia researchers may ask themselves-or be asked by others-whether their research is relevant in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. This commentary argues that schizophrenia research is more relevant than ever during this public health crisis, because of the likelihood that the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to increased incidence of psychotic disorders.\n Journal Pre-proof","text_body":"In 2010, US Senators Coburn and McCain published a highly critical report of -torrential, misdirected\u2016 government spending during the 2008 Recession (Coburn and McCain, 2010) .\nAmong other items, the report singled out research on primate models of glutamate function in cocaine abuse, suggesting that -studying drug-crazed primates\u2016 would not improve the national economy (Coburn and McCain, 2010, para. 28) . This begs the question: is substance abuse research relevant during a recession? Over the past three decades, researchers have tackled the question of how economic recessions impact substance use. In fact, the evidence shows that problematic substance use tends to increase during recessions, leading to higher incidence and relapse rates of substance use disorders (Nagelhout et al., 2017) . If anything, substance abuse research becomes more relevant during a recession, to care for these additional cases.\nResearchers in many areas are likely asking themselves similar questions right now, about whether their work is relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic. And as research and funding priorities are re-examined in response to the pandemic, we may face tough questions about our work's relevance in the months and years to come. Recalling Coburn and McCain, certain voices are already working to sway public opinion against allegedly wasteful research spending-see, for example, a recent Fox News article castigating the US Department of Health and Human Services for funding a small veterinary study on amino levels in dog urine during the COVID-19 crisis (Olson, 2020) .\nAs schizophrenia researchers, we focus on a debilitating condition which remains largely invisible despite costing the world economy hundreds of billions of dollars per year (Chong et al., 2016) . We all have a role to play in preventing it from becoming more invisible during this J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH AND COVID-19 3 pandemic. We all should be prepared to answer tough questions-to ourselves and others-about our work's relevance in the face of this generational public health crisis.\nTo that end, it may be helpful briefly to review empirical findings on coronaviruses and schizophrenia. Several lines of research have linked viral infections in various life stages to psychotic psychopathology. Although retrospective epidemiological research is challenging and often contested, many studies have reported that viral infections during pregnancy increase the risk of schizophrenia (K\u0119pi\u0144ska et al., 2020) . Similarly, viral infections in childhood appear to increase the risk of psychotic disorders in adulthood (Khandaker et al., 2012) . Finally, psychoneuroimmunological analyses of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, neural function, and brain tissue suggest that the progression of psychotic disorders in adults may be accompanied by abnormal peripheral and brain immune responses (De Picker et al., 2017) . Viral infection and immune responses may impact psychotic disorders by multiple pathways in utero, in childhood, and in adulthood.\nMoreover, a small body of evidence suggests that coronaviruses may pose a specific risk for psychotic disorders. Coronaviruses are neuroinvasive, entering the brain via the olfactory neural pathway, and have been found in human brain tissue post mortem (Arbour et al., 2000) .\nCOVID-19 may also be able to transmit placentally from mother to child in utero and directly impact foetal development (H. L. Zeng et al., 2020 , but see also Kimberlin and Stagno, 2020) . There is some evidence that coronaviruses like COVID-19 can have acute and chronic impacts on neural development and function. Acute psychosis has been observed in individuals infected with SARS, a coronavirus similar to COVID-19 (Cheng et al., 2004; Gardner and Moallef, 2015) , although steroidal medications administered to SARS patients may have played a role in these cases. Chronic effects have also been observed in one study of Viral infection appears to be a general risk factor for psychotic disorders, and coronavirus infection may also be a specific risk factor, conferring acute and long-term risk for psychosis.\nEven if the increased risk is marginal, the ongoing massive worldwide exposure to COVID-19 is likely to increase the incidence of psychotic disorders by a meaningful number of cases. If this happens, it will ripple into the future, affecting not only vulnerable adults, but also children who may develop a psychotic disorder later in life, and unborn children who will carry an elevated risk throughout their lifetimes. Those impacted will need basic clinical research to understand their developing disorders, translational and intervention research to improve their quality of life, and policy research to systemically prepare for their care.

Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions. Methods: Based on recently published literatures, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Results: The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicating a bat origin.

For R0\u02c31, the number of infected is likely to increase; for R0 \u02c21, transmission is likely to decline and die out. The reproductive number updated along with the development of the outbreak and interventions. R0 was estimated to be around 3 for SARS (Bauch et al., 2005) and \u02c21 for MERS (Bauch and Oraby, 2013) . The preliminary R0 of 2019-nCoV was reported as 2.24-3.58 . Several research groups reported estimated R0 of the outbreak depending on distinct estimation methods and the validity of underlying assumptions. Liu et al. (2020) reviewed all of the 12 references of an estimated R0 ranged from 1.4 to 6.49, with a mean of 3.28 and a median of 2.79. In clinical studies, a 425-case study by 22 January 2020, reported an R0 of approximately 2.2(95%CI, 1.4-3.9) , while another 4021-case study by 26 January 2020, estimated 3.77(95%CI, 3.51-4.05) . The discrepancy may be due to sample number and different stages of the pandemic.\nIncubation period is defined as the interval from initial exposure to an infectious agent to onset of any symptoms or signs it causes. A long incubation period may lead to a high rate of asymptomatic and subclinical infection. The first prediction of mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95%CI, 4.1-7.0 days), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days, based on 2019-nCoV exposure histories of the first 425 cases in Wuhan . A 4021-case study reported 4.75 days (interquartile range: J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3.0-7.2 days) . Another 88-exported-case study calculated the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (95%CI, 5.6-7.7 days), using known travel histories to and from Wuhan and symptom onset dates (Backer et al., 2020) . All these literatures lay the foundation to set 14 days as the medical observation period if any exposure occurred. A latest study collected 1099 cases from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces in China and declared a median incubation period of 3.0 days, ranging from 0 to surprisingly 24.0 days. An adjustments in screening and control policies may be needed. The 2019-nCoV generally has a longer incubation time than SARS-CoV (4.0 days, 95% CI 3.6-4.4 days) (Lessler et al., 2009 ) and MERS-CoV (range 4.5-5.2 days) (Park et al., 2018) .\nSerial interval is the interval from illness onset in a primary case to illness onset in the secondary case. The mean serial interval was estimated at 7.5 days(95% CI, 5.3-19days) using contact tracing data from early Wuhan cases in 2019-nCoV pandemic, which was shorter than the 8.4-day mean serial interval reported for SARS (Lipsitch et al., 2003) and 12.6-day for MERS (Cowling et al., 2015) . Another estimation of the mean serial interval from 26 infector-infectee pairs was surprisingly 2.6 days, which was shorter than the median incubation period, suggesting a substantial proportion of secondary transmission before illness onset (Nishiura et al., 2020) .\nThe CFR in early studies of COVID-19 involving relatively small samples of confirmed cases in Wuhan, varied from 4.3% to 14.6% Huang et al., 2020; , but that may not be able to reflect the truth. The CFR in Wuhan was undoubtedly higher than CFR outside of Wuhan. The reported CFR ranged 1.4%-3.06% in large nationwide case studies .\nPrognosis factors such as male, elderly patients aged\u2265 60 years, underlying disease, severe pneumonia at baseline and a delay from onset to diagnosis >5 days substantially elevated the CFRs . CFRs in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and respiratory disorders were as high as 10.5%, 7.3%, 6.0% and 6.3%, respectively. According to WHO announcement, SARS accounted for 8096 cases and 774 death, with a CFR of 9.6% (WHO, 2004 ","publish_time_x":"2020-04-01","authors_x":"Xie, Mingxuan; Chen, Qiong","journal_x":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.ijid.2020.03.071","H index_x":73.0,"section":"Reproductive number is an indication of the transmissibility of a virus,","total_rank":0.0895721925,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[3571],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak","outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],["range","range","range","range"],[],["asymptomatic"],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],["reproducti"],[],["age","age","age","age"],[],["period,"],[],["R0","R0","R0","R0","R0","R0","R0"],[],[],["Incub","incub","incub","incub","incub","incub","incub"],["generat"],["factor"],[],["Serial","serial","serial","serial"]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"4bc41aaa2b754b3ec526eb40c384a18ab38b8d51","title_x":"Journal Pre-proof Insight into 2019 novel coronavirus -an updated intrim review and lessons from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Insight into 2019 novel coronavirus -an updated intrim review and lessons from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV","abstract_x":"The COVID-19 had a high R0, a long incubation period, and a short serial interval. \uf06c The COVID-19 had a general low CFR, but much higher in patients with comorbidities.\n \uf06c The spike protein binding to ACE2 may explain the high R0 of COVID-19.\n \uf06c Autopsy showed more exudative lesions, and less fibrosis and consolidation. \uf06c Remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma may be effective. Abstract: Background: The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat. Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions. Methods: Based on recently published literatures, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Results: The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicating a bat origin. The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS. Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems. Potential treatments included remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible).\n Conclusion: The initial experience from the current pandemic and lessons from the previous two pandemics can help improve future preparedness plans and combat disease progression.","text_body":"Clinical presentation of COVID-19 greatly resembled viral pneumonia such as SARS and MERS. Most cases are mild cases(81%), whose symptoms were usually self-limiting and recovery in two weeks (Wu and McGoogan, 2020) . Severe patients progressed rapidly with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock, eventually ended in multiple organ failure.\nGeneral information of four inpatient case studies with relatively comprehensive data were summarized in supplementary table 1. The 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly men with comorbidities. Males were more susceptible to 2019-nCoV infection, same as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV studies (Badawi and Ryoo, 2016) , due to X chromosome and sex hormones' role on innate and adaptive immunity (Jaillon et al., 2019) . Chronic underlying diseases (mainly hypertension, cardio-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes) may increase the risk of 2019-nCoV infection , which is similar to MERS-CoV infection (Badawi and Ryoo, 2016) . Smoking may be a negative prognostic indicator for COVID-19 Guan et al., 2020) .\nClinical information of the above four selected inpatient case studies were summarized in supplementary table 2. Onset of symptoms were usually mild and nonspecific, presenting by fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Very few COVID-19 patients had prominent upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, diarrhea) Huang et al., 2020) , compared to 20-25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection developed diarrhea (Assiri et al., 2013) . However, only 43.8% of COVID-19 patients had an initial presentation of fever, and developed to 87.9% following hospitalization , compared to as high as 99% and 98% frequent in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection (Badawi and Ryoo, 2016) . Those patients without fever or even asymptomatic may be left un-quarantined as silent infection source, if the surveillance methods focused heavily J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f on fever detection. Moreover, the onset of symptoms may help physicians identifying patients with poor prognosis. Patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to report pharyngeal pain, dyspnea, dizziness, abdominal pain and anorexia .\nIn terms of laboratory findings, a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes could be used as an index in the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection, indicating a consumption of immune cells and an impairment to cellular immune function . Non-survivors developed more severe lymphopenia over time . Initial proinflammatory plasma cytokine concentrations were higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy adults. ICU patients had even higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 compared to non-ICU patients . There were numerous differences in laboratory findings between patients admitted to the ICU and those not, including higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts, higher levels of D-dimer, creatine kinase, and creatine in ICU patients .\nTypical chest CT manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia were initially small subpleural ground glass opacities that grew larger with crazy-paving pattern and consolidation. After two weeks of growth, the lesions were gradually absorbed leaving extensive opacities and subpleural parenchymal bands in recovery patients. However, Guan et al. ( 2020) demonstrated that patients with normal radiologic findings on initial presentation consisted of 23.9% and 5.2% of severe and non-severe cases respectively, which add the complexity to disease control. (Nicholls et al., 2003) . Thrombi were seen in all six autopsies of SARS-CoV infected patients, with even huge thrombus formation in part of pulmonary vessels. Coagulation function disorders were reported in most of the severe COVID-19 patients, by elevated levels of D-Dimer and prolonged prothrombin time, some of whom ended in disseminated intravascular coagulation Huang et al., 2020; . This may explain some sudden death of clinical recovery patients and serve as an indication for disease severity. In an autopsy study, the only one patient without usage of corticosteroids demonstrated increased CD3+ lymphocyte than five other specimen treated by corticosteroids (Pei et al., 2005) . It suggested an inhibition of immune system similarities. The human monoclonal antibody could efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV and inhibit syncytia formation between S-protein and ACE2 expressing cells (Sui et al., 2004) . Appropriate modification of the monoclonal antibody may be effective for treatment of COVID-19. What's more, potential therapies targeting the renin-angiotensin system, to increase ACE2 expression and inhibit ACE may be There are no effective antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection, even the strong candidates as lopinavir\/ritonavir and abidol exhibited no remarkable effect on clinical improvement, day 28 mortality or virus clearance (Chen et al., 2020) . Expectation and attention were shifted to \"remdesivir\" which may be the most potential wide-spectrum drug for antiviral treatment of 2019-nCoV. Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue, which incorporates into novel viral RNA chains and results in pre-mature termination.","publish_time_x":"2020-04-01","authors_x":"Xie, Mingxuan; Chen, Qiong","journal_x":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.ijid.2020.03.071","H index_x":73.0,"section":"Clinical manifestations","total_rank":0.0766629087,"risk_factors":["smoking","diabetes"],"match_indices":[986,864],"smoking_count":1,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],["surviv"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk"],[],[],["asymptomatic"],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age"],[],[],["health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"995847926bde7c0022c3c2b8ac9f3f84756c221d","title_x":"Experimental Treatment with Favipiravir for COVID-19: An Open-Label Control Study-NC-ND license (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-nd\/4.0\/)","abstract_x":"An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its caused coronavirus disease 2019 has been reported in China since December 2019.

Sominsky).\n Brain, Behavior, and Immunity xxx (xxxx) xxx-xxx 0889-1591\/","text_body":"The idea that responses to disease are heterogeneous within a population is well-acknowledged in the epidemiological community. However, is not one that is particularly well integrated in basic biomedical science research. For decades, if not centuries now, fundamental science has worked with the broad assumption that male mouse and rat models of young-adult age in the absence of a life history of neuroimmune challenge (Pittman, 2019) are necessary and sufficient to understand all of mammalian physiology.\nWe also routinely work with how a treatment affects the mean response of a population. Admittedly, there are numerous road blocks to approaching things differently. There is significant cost in both monetary terms and in time in assessing an outcome in both sexes at various stages of hormonal peaks at multiple ages across the lifespan and on the background of a wealth of life experiences. The logistics of \"thinking outside the mean\" are also complicated and costly. An individual response well-outside the mean could indicate that this single animal or human patient holds the cure to the next viral outbreak, or could just indicate pipetting error or a random variation that is physiologically meaningless for a workable part of the population. The latter issue indicates a particular importance of rigorous statistical approaches in the analysis of our own scientific work and in the assessment of work by others (Makin and Orban de Xivry, 2019) . A limited sample-size, for instance, may be insufficient to provide valuable information in some cases, but may shed light on critical details in other circumstances when the sample is inherently limited. With appropriate experimental and statistical controls in place, it is therefore essential to start focusing on individual populations of vulnerability and resilience.\nIn addition to children, pregnant women also represent a vulnerable population at risk for viral infections, with increased risk of complications in influenza, including the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic (Siston et al., 2010) , varicella virus, measles and the severe foetal consequences of Zika virus (reviewed in (Racicot and Mor, 2017) ). Interestingly, and in line with the pattern of COVID-19 producing milder symptoms in children, there is currently no evidence for increased risk of severe outcomes of COVID-19 in pregnant women. We should note, though, that this evidence is based on limited data, while reports from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and from other respiratory infections suggest these conclusions are premature and pregnant women could be at risk of a severe course of COVID-19 (Rasmussen et al., 2020) . If, however, pregnancy proves to provide some protection from disease severity, it could offer unique opportunities for the development of therapeutic solutions. It would also be essential to see whether COVID-19 during pregnancy has longer-term implications for the offspring, similar to neurodevelopmental impacts of maternal influenza and other infections (Meyer et al., 2007) .\nAs mentioned above, the elderly and those suffering from chronic medical conditions are also at high risk of severe disease outcomes, and, as such, the unique characteristics of these populations should always be considered when attempting to extrapolate scientific discoveries and their therapeutic applications. This approach is at the heart of a personalised (individualised) medicine approach, where patients' therapies are targeted based on their genetic differences, along with their unique lifestyles and other environmental factors (Conti et al., 2010) . The current COVID-19 pandemic and its epidemiology is yet another reminder there is no 'one size fits all' when it comes to all aspects of scientific research, including experimental design, statistical analyses and therapeutic implications.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-20","authors_x":"Sominsky, Luba; Walker, David W.; Spencer, Sarah J.","journal_x":"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.bbi.2020.03.016","H index_x":127.0,"section":"One size does not fit all","total_rank":0.1085626911,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[1863,2358,2563,2666,2873],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":5,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["model"],["outbreak"],[],["statist","statist","statist"],["analysi"],["experiment","experiment"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk","risk","risk","risk"],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"33a2e44b9179dc6e5953bbc2337ec4890fff9472","title_x":"Clinical and CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia: Focus on pregnant women and children","abstract_x":"Background: The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia is globally concerning.

[1] [2] [3] The newly identified virus has been recently named \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was designated coronavirus disease 2019 World Health Organization (WHO). 4 The SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus besides coronavirus 229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 1 The initial clusters of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were epidemiologically linked to local seafood market in Wuhan, and person-to-person transmission was subsequently confirmed. [5] [6] [7] It has rapidly spread globally. As of February 18, 72,532 cases were laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed, and 6242 were suspected in China. 8 The reproductive number (R0), defined as the expected number of secondary infectious cases generated by an infectious case in a susceptible population, is estimated to 3.77. 9 Recent publications have depicted the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. 2 , 3 , 7 , 9-11 The definite diagnosis of COVID-19 is expected with the novel coronavirus nucleic acid positive in swabs, sputum, or secretions from the lower respiratory tract, or blood by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). However, the new coronavirus nucleic acid kits are in short supply and time-consuming in manipulation. Furthermore, false negatives may exist in some cases due to the insufficient viral materials in the specimen. Recent studies have reported the cases with initial SARS-CoV-2 negative but typical CT findings, 12 , 13 however, most of them turned out to be positive after repeated tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Therefore, chest CT imaging plays a critical role in the surveillance and diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia with a higher sensitivity and efficiency than the chest X-rays do. Guan et al. also reported that 76.4% cases with viral pneumonia findings at CT were verified COVID-19. 11 Based on the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia, patients with typical CT imaging features in Hubei Province will be grouped as clinicallydiagnosed cases, contributing to the total number of confirmed diagnosis according to the \"Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 Pneumonia (Fifth Trial Version)\" released by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China since February 12, 2020. 14 Pregnant women are more susceptible to infectious diseases due to the immune suppression. 15 Previous studies found that there was a male-dominated tendency and few cases occurred in children for COVID-19 pneumonia. 3 , 9 To the best of our knowledge, there are few published data involving the clinical and chest CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women and children. 16 , 17 In this present study, the clinical and chest CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia were investigated for the pregnant women and children in comparison with non-pregnant adults from two centers.

The cases in the clinically-diagnosed pregnant group were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement at CT in which disputes for aggravating the patients' status took place due to the possible false negative or postponed coronavirus nucleic acid tests. Therefore, it is commonly speculated that some delay in management was worrisome in order to wait for a confirmed diagnosis. For limiting the epidemic, chest CT has been playing an indispensable role in selection of the candidates for quarantine in Wuhan and other places in China. For children, the CT findings were diverse from normal appearances to a few lesions including GGO or consolidation in lungs.\nThe ongoing outbreak COVID-19 pneumonia demonstrated a relatively high contagion; meanwhile there are no specific therapeutic drugs and vaccines for the COVID-19. Early identification of COVID-19 is important for the patients as well as the healthy population. Currently, the patients should be isolated for treatment from the healthy people for controlling the epidemic. It has been reported that chest CT is superior to RT-PCR in sensitivity for early detection of COVID-19. 22 Based on the epidemiological characteristics, clinically-diagnosed cases with typical CT features were treated with the same therapy in Hubei Province to offset the effects of possible false negative of the new coronavirus nucleic acid tests. 13 In our study, 44% and 36% pregnant women presented initial onset of fever in either laboratory-confirmed or clinicallydiagnosed group, which was less common than 87.9% in the nonpregnant population in the study by Guan et al. 11 and consistent with the previous study enrolling 9 pregnant women with COVID-19. 17 Currently, fever served as the basic screening flag in China. Absence of typical symptoms increased the difficulty of the surveillance in the pregnant population. Furthermore, the physiological findings about leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio due to adaptations to gestation could further complicate the situation. Nevertheless, no pregnant women were admitted to ICU. Compared with the previous studies, 11 it may be one of the reasons there were more cases of pregnant women categorized as mild or common type in clinical context. As with unenhanced chest CT imaging of pregnant women during the epidemic in Wuhan, low dose technique was implemented with the DLP ranging from 50 to 150 mGy cm for diagnostic imaging in our study, which was safe for the fetuses. 23 Sixteen pregnant women were performed with post-partum CT in our study. As with the CT features associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, the common characteristics in the pregnant group included pure GGO, GGO with consolidation or reticulation, and complete consolidation with predominantly peripheral distribution and bilateral lung involvement, which were similar to those of the non-pregnant group in our research as reported in the previous studies. 19 , 20 , 24 There were overlaps in imaging findings between COVID-19 and other viral infections, such as the coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pneumonia, as well as H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 infections. 19 , 20 The patterns of GGOs or GGO with the above features in predominantly peripheral distribution will facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. 20 The above imaging findings could be mostly explained by a recently published research on the pathological investigation of COVID-19. 25 Diffuse alveolar injury superimposed with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and hyaline membrane formation was identified on pathology. Other findings included pulmonary edema and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates (dominated by lymphocytes). Therefore, we have the GGOs, consolidations, and reticulations which indicate fibromyxoid exudates, the interstitial edema and the lymphocytes infiltrate resulting in the lymphopenia inside the blood. The more common consolidation and relatively higher TSS in the laboratoryconfirmed and clinically-diagnosed pregnant women suggested the more severity in pregnant women, except for three laboratoryconfirmed pregnant women showing no abnormalities related with COVID-19 pneumonia at CT. Therefore, there is no doubt that the CT study did a big favor in structuring the clinical treatment strategy for the pregnant women as we hoped. Fortunately, the infants were all normal without any evidence of vertical transmission from women with COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy, which was consistent with the prior research by Chen et al. 16 While compared between the two pregnant groups, the consolidation were more frequent in the clinically-diagnosed group with a relatively higher TSS of 4 \u00b78 (SD 3 \u00b75), indicating relatively more severe lung involvement resulting from delayed treatment prior to a laboratory confirmation. Cases with initial negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 but high clinical suspicion were also reported in previous studies, and the SARS-CoV-2 was positive after repeated tests. 12 , 13 For the clinically-diagnosed patients, it is speculated that samples from the lower respiratory tract via lavage and repeat tests may be helpful to rule out the false negative results. Fortunately, the laboratory-negative cases with typical imaging findings were supposed to receive the same treatment protocol as the positive ones in China. Pleural effusion was identified in 6\/16 (38%) and 6\/25 (24%) patients in the laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed pregnant groups, which was more than that in the study by Song et al. 20 This phenomenon could be attributed to a common finding within 1-24 h of normal delivery. 26 Compared with adults, fewer children are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Nine children younger than 14 years out of 1011 patients were reported by Guan et al. 11 Our study revealed that the non-specific abnormalities (pure GGO or consolidation) distributed without peripheral predominance at CT unlike the adults. However, when superimposed with other pathogen infections, the pulmonary involvement was more severe, as simultaneous infection of RSV and SARS-CoV-2 in one child was detected in our study. Nevertheless, it was difficult to distinguish if the consolidation was associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, since the consolidation and pleural effusion were also common in pure RSV infection. 27 The contact history and clinical symptoms of fever or cough may be helpful for the surveillance.\nWe performed the follow-up CT studies 3 days and 7 days after the initial CT. Compared with the previous studies, 24 , 28 most of the cases in our study demonstrated earlier progressive changes in lungs at first follow-up CT at 3 days. And most of them were witnessed to get improvements at second follow-up CT at about 7 days (6-9 days). Therefore, CT could be regarded as an efficient tool for the early detection and monitoring the dynamic evolution in the patients with COVID-19. 24 Our study has several limitations. Firstly, the sample size was relatively small. Larger population from more centers should be warranted to validate our preliminary results. In addition, even though it's a study conducted in two centers, the majority of patients was from the hospital majoring in women and children, then the selection bias existed. Secondly, 22 pregnant women are outpatients, thus the follow-up CT images were absent for monitoring the therapeutic effects. Finally, for the pregnant woman and children, low dose technique was implemented so that the image quality was not so good as that of the non-pregnant adult group, but fortunately it's sufficient to evaluate the lesions.\nIn conclusion, our preliminary study demonstrated that the clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were atypical, bringing about difficulties in early detection. The clinically-diagnosed pregnant cases shared similar chest CT features with the laboratory-confirmed ones, but with more severe consolidation lesions, and repeated SARS-CoV-2 tests should be implemented for these highly clinical suspicious patients, however, the negative tests will not hinder the management based on the typical clinical and imaging findings in clinical context where the COVID-19 is life-threatening. Chest CT study was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and monitoring the therapeutic effects with or without SARS-CoV-2 confirmation for this population. The chest CT imaging features of children with COVID-19 pneumonia were non-specific, while the exposure history and clinical symptoms could be more helpful for the screening.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-21","authors_x":"Liu, Huanhuan; Liu, Fang; Li, Jinning; Zhang, Tingting; Wang, Dengbin; Lan, Weishun","journal_x":"Journal of Infection","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.jinf.2020.03.007","H index_x":90.0,"section":"Discussion","total_rank":0.0689198144,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[129,185,251,307,477,531,1903,2055,2157,2332,2531,2661,2771,2974,3132,3347,4470,4516,4569,4766,4924,5029,5930,7737,7867,7992,8151,8278],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":38,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":true,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["investigati","investigati"],[],["outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],["health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"9b9670086d775b200fc90433e94bb556d9a58d16","title_x":"Journal Pre-proof The Imperfect Cytokine Storm: Severe COVID-19 with ARDS in Patient on Durable LVAD Support The Imperfect Cytokine Storm: Severe COVID-19 with ARDS in Patient on Durable LVAD Support Running Title: Severe COVID-19 in Patient on Durable LVAD LVAD = left ventricular assist device MODS = multiorgan dysfunction syndrome PEA = pulseless electrical activity PI event = pulsatility index event RV = right ventricle SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","abstract_x":"As health systems worldwide grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, patients on durable LVAD support represent a unique population at risk for the disease.

A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3-4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.","text_body":"According to Nature, the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming unstoppable and has already reached the necessary epidemiological criteria for it to be declared a pandemic, having infected more than 100 000 people in 100 countries. 1 Therefore, a coordinated global response is desperately needed to prepare health systems to meet this unprecedented challenge. Countries that have been unfortunate enough to have been exposed to this disease already have, paradoxically, very valuable lessons to pass on. Although the containment measures implemented in China have-at least for the momentreduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case in other countries, including Italy and Iran. 2 Italy has had 12 462 confirmed cases according to the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 as of March 11, and 827 deaths. Only China has recorded more deaths due to this COVID-19 outbreak. The mean age of those who died in Italy was 81 years and more than two-thirds of these patients had diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or cancer, or were former smokers. It is therefore true that these patients had underlying health conditions, but it is also worth noting that they had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, needed respiratory support, and would not have died otherwise. Of the patients who died, 42\u00b72% were aged 80-89 years, 32\u00b74% were aged 70-79 years, 8\u00b74% were aged 60-69 years, and 2\u00b78% were aged 50-59 years (those aged >90 years made up 14\u00b71%). The male to female ratio is 80% to 20% with an older median age for women (83\u00b74 years for women vs 79\u00b79 years for men).\nOn March 8, 2020, the Italian Government imple mented extraordinary measures to limit viral transmission-including restricting movement in the region of Lombardythat intended to minimise the likelihood that people who are not infected come into contact with people who are infected. This decision is certainly courageous and important, but it is not enough. At present, our national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of those who are already infected and require admission to an intensive care unit for ARDS, largely due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, is a matter of grave concern. Specifically, the percentage of patients admitted to intensive care units reported daily in Italy, from March 1, up until March 11, was consistently between 9% and 11% of patients who were actively infected.\nIn Italy, we have approximately 5200 beds in intensive care units. Of those, as of March 11, 1028 are already devoted to patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in the near future this number will progressively increase to the point that thousands of beds will soon be occupied by patients with COVID-19. Given that the mortality of patients who are critically ill with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is high and that the survival time of non-survivors is 1-2 weeks, the number of people infected in Italy will probably impose a major strain on critical care facilities in our hospitals, some of which do not have adequate resources or staff to deal with this emergency. In the Lombardy region, despite extraordinary efforts to restrict the movement of people at the expense of the Italian economy, we are dealing with an even greater fear-that the number of patients who present to the emergency room will become much greater than the system can cope with. The number of intensive care beds necessary to give the maximum number of patients the chance to be treated will reach several thousand, but the exact number is still a matter of discussion among experts. Health-care professionals have been working day and night since Feb 20, and in doing so around 20% (n=350) of them have become infected, and some have died. Lombardy is responding to the lack of beds for patients with COVID-19 by sending patients who need intensive care but are not infected with COVID-19 to hospitals outside of the region to contain the virus.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-13","authors_x":"Remuzzi, Andrea; Remuzzi, Giuseppe","journal_x":"The Lancet","doi_x":"10.1016\/s0140-6736(20)30627-9","H index_x":700.0,"section":"Introduction","total_rank":0.0918918919,"risk_factors":["smoking","diabetes"],"match_indices":[1065,1004],"smoking_count":1,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact"],["surviv","surviv"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],["health","health","health","Health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"1414dd331cc6c6f0079a57308294dbc6dad51a4a","title_x":"Journal Pre-proof Maximizing the Calm Before the Storm: Tiered Surgical Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Maximizing the Calm Before the Storm: Tiered Surgical Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Introduction","abstract_x":"The novel coronavirus was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now spread throughout the world, being verified by the World Health Organization as a Pandemic on March 11 th . This had led to the calling of a national emergency on March 13 th in the United States. Many hospitals, healthcare networks, and specifically Departments of Surgery are asking the same questions of how to cope and plan for surge capacity, personnel attrition, novel infrastructure utilization, and resource exhaustion. Herein, we present a tiered plan for surgical department planning based on incident command levels. This includes Acute Care Surgeon deployment (given their critical care training and vertically integrated position in the hospital), recommended infrastructure and transfer utilization, triage principles, and faculty, resident and advanced care practitioner deployment.","text_body":"In reflection of the above principles, led by Acute Care Surgeons with familiarity in Disaster Preparedness and Public Health, in conjunction with the incident command structure, and in an effort to keep in mind a prolonged surge of COVID-19 patients, the following Surgery Department COVID-19 Response Plan was created (Table 1 ). This has now been disseminated and adapted to each facility, subspecialty surgical service, and is being pivoted to other specialties such as Pulmonary Critical Care and Internal Medicine within Atrium Health. Key in understanding the response level is your individual facilities incident command response level which follows similar structure set by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 4, 12 However, new to this schema is ConditionZero which indicates patient surge and acuity beyond the capacity of the infrastructure and manpower available, a scenario currently being experienced in Italy, Iran, and progressively around the world. Advancement to higher tiers should follow incident command structure, but may also be required within individual specialties, departments, or divisions plans given manpower and resource depletion.\nAt Alert level, which many facilities in the US have already surpassed, disaster preparedness must begin in earnest and non-time sensitive elective cases, or many cases in high risk patients, should be delayed, cancelled, and rescheduled for no sooner than 3 months in the future. Limitations on non-emergent transfers, non-operating room anesthesia (NORA) cases, and furlough of non-essential non-clinical staff should occur. Clinic triage and telemedicine should be performed whenever able. Prioritization to develop plans for further Tiers and organization of surgeons into potential call back-up pools should be performed. Additionally, in large health systems and regional collaboratives, efforts to back-up community facilities from larger tertiary departments should be performed to limit transfers required due to quarantined or furloughed surgeons at these sites.\nIn progression to further tiers, great focus is given the Acute Care Surgeon ability to staff trauma, SCC, and EGS services, given their true vertical integration in the hospital from the ED, OR, floor, and ICU. Given their flexibility, and critical care training, it will be key to support these ACS faculty with non-ACS surgeons to manage EGS and eventually even trauma. This will allow the ACS Surgeons to support expanded ICU's, OR ICU conversion, and ECMO patients. At non-trauma centers, in the community, or with no ACS faculty, General Surgeon coverage and adaptation of this plan will be paramount to cover all surgical and COVID-19 patients. At Level 2, healthcare providers will begin to be furloughed, and decreased resources like blood, ventilators, and PPE will be available. Subsequently, a 50% drawdown of all elective cases should be performed with focus on completing necessary cardiovascular and cancer cases, but patients with high risk factors should be deferred (age >60, DM, HTN, smoking hx, COPD just released by the American College of Surgeons. 21 Rearrangements of schedule and service coverage responsibility for residents, APP, and faculty should begin, and cycling of on call teams by several days or a week should be encouraged.\nResponse Level 1 will have accumulating provider and staff attrition due to quarantine and illness. Additionally, stocks of PPE, blood, ventilators and other essential infrastructure will be diminished by increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, all non-emergent cases should be cancelled, and transfer requests managed at the requesting facility. All surgical transfers should be vetted by an ACS surgeon with situational awareness to assess its acuity, available resources and beds, and if care may be futile. Expanded ICU beds and staffing by the ACS faculty will be required and non-ACS surgeons required to flex to cover EGS. Teams of younger ACS faculty can be deployed to cover medical ICU's if needed, and expect SCC fellows to have battlefield promotions to junior ICU attending status. ECMO should be reserved for young, non-comorbid patients, with single organ dysfunction and acceptable prognosis. Expect decreasing staff and blood availability as quarantine and social distancing impact the community.\nGraduated resident autonomy and Chief Resident run floor services will be expected.\nFinally, if the surge in patients comes as a tsunami as it did in Italy and Wuhan, Condition Zero will require stretching the infrastructure and manpower beyond the breaking point. In this scenario, ACS surgeons should focus on just ICU patient care, and non-ACS surgeons cover trauma and EGS in a tiered response. Non-emergent cases should not be performed, and non-operative modalities should be pursued if possible for all urgent disease processes. The export of urgent EGS cases may be required to other centers Advanced triage criteria with consideration of available resources, expected increase in surge volume, patient risk factors, and principles of justice and value unfortunately must be considered for the continuation and betterment of our society. Novel ventilation strategies should be pursued whenever able, and even emergent non-COVID care may need to be triaged or suspended for certain disease processes if the system, facility, and providers are over-leveraged. At this level COVID-19+ healthcare workers may need to continue treating COVID-19 patients given the extreme attrition of personnel at this level.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-30","authors_x":"Ross, Samuel Wade; Lauer, Cynthia W.; Miles, William S.; Green, John M.; Christmas, A Britton; May, Addison K.; Matthews, Brent D.","journal_x":"Journal of the American College of Surgeons","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.jamcollsurg.2020.03.019","H index_x":159.0,"section":"Tiered Response","total_rank":0.0706751055,"risk_factors":["smoking"],"match_indices":[3053],"smoking_count":1,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk","risk"],["range"],[],[],[],[],[],["age","Age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],["Health","Health","health","health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],["factor","factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"4e57b159fa201bb9397c9e0bcd824ee75d9ad6e3","title_x":"Diagnosis of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): rRT-PCR or CT?","abstract_x":"Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of computed tomography (CT) and real-time reverse-transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for COVID-19 pneumonia.

The sensitivities of both tests were then compared. For patients with a final confirmed diagnosis, clinical and laboratory data, in addition to CT imaging findings were evaluated. Results: A total of 36 patients were finally diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Thirty-five patients had abnormal CT findings at presentation, whereas one patient had a normal CT.

At presentation, CT sensitivity was therefore 97.2%, whereas the sensitivity of initial rRT-PCR was only 83.3%. Conclusion: rRT-PCR may produce initial false negative results. We suggest that patients with typical CT findings but negative rRT-PCR results should be isolated, and rRT-PCR should be repeated to avoid misdiagnosis.","text_body":"COVID-19 pneumonia broke out in Wuhan. On January 30th, 2020, the pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus was issued as a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO [6, 7] . The source of the infection was a novel coronavirus(SARS CoV2), with symptomatic and asymptomatic infections reported. To-date, respiratory droplets and direct contact have been identified as the main transmissions routes. Aerosol and digestive tract transmission remain to be confirmed. The incubation period of the disease is generally 3-7 days, but no longer than 14 days [5, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Due to its strong infectivity profile, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial, otherwise human mediated disease spread can seriously endanger public health.\nOur retrospective analysis showed that the sensitivity of initial CT was 97.2%, whereas initial rRT-PCR sensitivity was 83.3%, with 6 initially missed cases. This may be related to sample collection as pharyngeal oral and nasal sampling are easier collection methods, whereas lower respiratory tract sampling is relatively difficult to perform, with medical staff susceptible to get infected [16] . The sensitivity of the rRT-PCR kit can also contribute to false negatives. Chung reported that 3 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia showed normal CT findings [2] . In this study, only one patient was observed with positive rRT-PCR but negative CT. Considering that the results of rRT-PCR may be false-negative, and the relatively long assay time, we recommend that the patients with typical imaging findings should be isolated and rRT-PCR repeated to avoid misdiagnosis.\nFor the COVID-19 pneumonia group in this study, most patients had a clear contact history with the epidemic area. In these patients, the total number of leukocytes was normal or decreased, similar to previous reported in the literature [10, [17] [18] [19] . Interestingly, we found that more patients with increased blood glucose levels were observed in the COVID-19 pneumonia group as compared to the control group (47.2% vs 27.5%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.058). It remains unclear how many patients in this group will finally be diagnosed with diabetes, but those with high blood fasting glucose level might be more sensitive to COVID-19 pneumonia, which requires further confirmation. The typical imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia consist in single or multiple patchy consolidations or GGO in both lungs. In this study, GGO with consolidation was the commonest abnormality. The distribution of the lesions was predominantly peripheral, seen in 72.2% of patients. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were rarely observed, consistent with previous studies [20] [21] [22] .\nThis study had some limitations. Firstly, due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia in this area, the supply of nucleic acid detection kits was limited, and the rRT-PCR examinations were only performed in patients with fever and positive CT tests. Additionally, the sample size of this study was small, and the cases lacked follow-up due to time constraints. Larger sample sizes are therefore required for further verification.\nIn summary, CT examinations appear sensitive virus detection, whereas rRT-PCR may produce false-negative results. We therefore recommend that patients with positive imaging findings but negative rRT-PCR results should be isolated and rRT-PCR repeated to avoid misdiagnosis.","publish_time_x":"2020-05-31","authors_x":"Long, Chunqin; Xu, Huaxiang; Shen, Qinglin; Zhang, Xianghai; Fan, Bing; Wang, Chuanhong; Zeng, Bingliang; Li, Zicong; Li, Xiaofen; Li, Honglu","journal_x":"European Journal of Radiology","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.ejrad.2020.108961","H index_x":102.0,"section":"Discussion","total_rank":0.1061806656,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[2244],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],["profil"],[],[],["contact","contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak"],[],["statist"],["analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["retrospective analysis"],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],["asymptomatic"],["infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],["route"],[],[],[],["health","health"],[],[],[],["incub"],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"1aed8cc899c77553312d72e2ec022fd77e50b4fb","title_x":"Journal Pre-proof Transmission potential and severity of COVID-19 in South Korea Title: Transmission potential and severity of COVID-19 in South Korea","abstract_x":"South Korea, the number of cases rapidly increased, resulting in 6,284 cases including 42 deaths as of March 6, 2020. To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we aimed to present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea.\n The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval.\n We identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7) and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19. The crude case fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and increases with older age. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Conclusions: Our results indicate early sustained transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.","text_body":"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged out of the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019 has already demonstrated its potential to generate explosive outbreaks in confined settings and cross borders following human mobility patterns (Mizumoto et al., 2020) . While COVID-19 frequently induces mild symptoms common to other respiratory infections, it has also exhibited an ability to generate severe disease among certain groups including older populations and individuals with underlying health issues such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes (Adler, 2020) . Nevertheless, a clear picture of the epidemiology of this novel coronavirus is still being elucidated.\nThe number of cases of COVID-19 in the province of Hubei, the disease epicenter, quickly climbed following an exponential growth trend. The total number of COVID-19 cases is at 80,859 including 3,100 deaths in China as of March 8, 2020 (WHO, 2020 . Fortunately, by February 15, 2020 the daily number of new reported cases in China started to decline across the country although Hubei Province reported 128 cases on average per day in the week of March 2-8, 2020 (WHO, 2020) . While the epidemic continues to decline in China, 24,727 COVID-19 cases have been reported in more than 100 countries outside of China including South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, Germany, and France (WHO, 2020).\nIn particular, South Korea quickly became one of the hardest hit countries with COVID-19, exhibiting a steadily increasing number of cases over the last few days. Hence, it is crucial to monitor the progression of these outbreaks and assess the effects of various public health measures including the social distancing measures in real time.\nThe first case in South Korea was identified on January 20, 2020 followed by the detection of one or two cases on average in the subsequent days. However, the number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection started to increase rapidly on February 19, 2020 with a total of 6,284 confirmed COVID-19 cases including 42 deaths reported as of March 6, 2020 according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) (KCDC, 2020) ( Table 1 ). The epicenter of the South Korean COVID-19 outbreak has been identified in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million people, approximately 150 miles South East of Seoul. The rapid spread of COVID-19 in South Korea has been attributed to one case linked to a superspreading event that has led to more than 3,900 secondary cases stemming from church services in the city of Daegu (Kuhn, 2020 , Ryall, 2020 . This has led to sustained transmission chains of COVID-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 19, with 55% of the cases associated with the church cluster in Daegu (Bostock, 2020) . Moreover, three other clusters have been reported including one set in Chundo Daenam hospital in Chungdo-gun, Gyeongsanggbuk-do (118 cases), one set in the gym in Cheonan, Chungcheongnam-do (92 cases), and one Pilgrimage to Israel cluster in Gyeongsanggbuk-do (49 cases). These few clusters have become the major driving force of the infection. A total of 33 cases were imported while the four major clusters are composed of local cases as described in Table 2 .\nTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Korea has been exacerbated by amplified transmission in confined settings including a hospital and a church in the city of Daegu. The hospital-based outbreak alone involves 118 individuals including 9 hospital staff (News, 2020) , which is reminiscent of past outbreaks of SARS and MERS (Chowell et al., 2015) . To respond to the mounting number of cases of COVID-19, the Korean government has raised the COVID-19 alert level to the highest (Level 4) on February 23, 2020 to facilitate the implementation of comprehensive social distancing measures including enhanced infection control measures in hospitals, restricting public transportation, cancelling social events, and delaying the start of school activities (Kim, 2020) .\nWhile the basic reproduction number, denoted by R0, applies at the outset of an exponentially growing epidemic in the context of an entirely susceptible population and in the absence of public health measures and behavior changes, the effective reproduction number (Rt) quantifies the time-dependent transmission potential. This key epidemiological parameter tracks the average number of secondary cases generated per case as the outbreak progresses over time. Steady values of Rt above 1 indicate sustained disease transmission, whereas values of Rt <1 do not support sustained transmission and the number of new cases is expected to follow a declining trend. In this report, using a mathematical model parameterized with cases series of the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea, we investigate the transmission potential and severity of COVID-19 in Korea using early data of local and imported cases reported up until February 26, 2020.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-18","authors_x":"Shim, Eunha; Tariq, Amna; Choi, Wongyeong; Lee, Yiseul; Chowell, Gerardo","journal_x":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.ijid.2020.03.031","H index_x":73.0,"section":"Introduction","total_rank":0.075535513,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[543],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[["mathemat"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["model"],["outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],["reproducti","reproducti"],[],["age","age","age","age"],[],[],["health","health","health"],["R0"],[],[],[],["generat","generat","generat"],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"73243d95149d9f2260f3c852599d7d39f4cc8ccc","title_x":"Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open- label non-randomized clinical trial","abstract_x":"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients.

Then she went into isolation at that hospital. On February 6, the second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results of her sputum came back positive, so she was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in a negative pressure isolation room of the Affiliated Infectious Hospital of Soochow University, the designated medical center for COVID-19 in Suzhou.\nOn admission, the physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.2\u00b0C, blood pressure of 95\/64 mmHg, pulse of 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% with Venturi mask at 5 liters per minute of oxygen. Lung auscultation revealed little rhonchi over the left lower lung field. Other laboratory findings included a leukocyte count of 10.60*10 9 \/L, neutrophils of 9.14*10 9 \/L, lymphocytes of 0.86*10 9 \/L, albumin of 24.6 g\/L, C-reactive protein of 19.6 mg\/L, D-dimer of 840 ug\/L, procalcitonin (PCT) of 0.288 ng\/ml, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 544 U\/L, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of 318 pg\/ml. Levels of creatinine and aminotransferase were within normal limits. A fetal ultrasound revealed a normally intrauterine fetus with normal anatomy of approximately 30 weeks of gestational age.\nSince SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified virus, it remains unknown whether the viral shedding during delivery occurs or the vertical transmission exists. Several multidisciplinary consultations were performed, concluding that given the current situation especially the CT scan and low levels of lymphocytes and albumin, the patient's condition might be deteriorated at any time, and she was at risk of preterm birth, so emergency scenarios for her were developed. Treatment with Arbidol (0.2g administered orally every 8 hours), Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets (400\/100mg administered orally every 8 hours), Cefoperazone Sodium and Sulbactam Sodium (3.0g administered intravenously every 8 hours), and Human Serum Albumin (20g administered intravenously every day) were initiated, dexamethasone and magnesium sulphate as prophylaxis for the fetus were given and an emergency cesarean section was prepared. On hospital day 3 morning (February 8), a repeated chest CT scan showed bilateral multiple ground-glass opacities ( Figure B) , a finding consistent with severe atypical pneumonia. In the afternoon, this patient had disappeared fetal movement and no variability of fetal heart rate monitoring, and no improvement was made on maximal ventilator support for four hours.\nAfter a multidisciplinary consultation was performed and informed consent was obtained, an emergency cesarean section under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia was performed with an estimated blood loss of 200ml in a designated negative pressure isolation room and all personnel involved wore protective gear including gown, N 95 mask, eye protection and gloves. A preterm male infant weighing 1.83 kg was delivered uneventfully, with Apgar scores of 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. And he was kept in the isolation ICU of the neonatal nursery for observation without any contact with his mother after birth. The newborn was given formula instead of breast milk ever since. During the delivery, samples of amniotic fluid, placenta, umbilical cord blood, gastric juice and throat swabs of the infant were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests, and all results were negative. On day 3 after cesarean section (February 11), RT-PCR analyses of the neonatal throat swab and stool samples were negative. On February 15 and 17, throat swab RT-PCR tests of the mother and the infant were negative. Three chest CT scans of the mother on February 12, 15 and 18, respectively, demonstrated resolution of infiltrates of both lung fields ( Figure C, D, E) . All healthcare workers in contact with the infant during his delivery and subsequent care had remained asymptomatic. The patient and her infant had an uneventful postpartum and neonatal course.","publish_time_x":"2020-02-28","authors_x":"Wang, Xiaotong; Zhou, Zhiqiang; Zhang, Jianping; Zhu, Fengfeng; Tang, Yongyan; Shen, Xinghua","journal_x":"Clin Infect Dis","doi_x":"10.1093\/cid\/ciaa200","H index_x":null,"section":"Case report","total_rank":0.0936739659,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[60],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":11,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":true,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact","contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk"],[],[],["asymptomatic"],["Infecti"],[],[],["age"],[],[],["health"],[],["shedd"],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"d29add1816c7d96d5738fd265cc7b7c5951b4f90","title_x":"A case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in a pregnant woman with preterm delivery","abstract_x":"We presented a case of a 30-week pregnant woman with COVID-19 delivering a healthy baby with no evidence of COVID-19.","text_body":"SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified virus, spreading quickly from Wuhan to different parts of China and the world. Respiratory droplet transmission is the main route of SARS-CoV-2, and it can also be transmitted through contact 3 . Several studies [6] [7] [8] [9] revealed that pregnant women with different viral respiratory illness were at high risk of developing obstetric complications and perinatal adverse outcomes compared to non-gravid women, due to changes of immune responses 10 . According to a previous report of 10 patients with SARS in pregnancy in Hong Kong 11 , SARS-CoV infection could be associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including critical maternal illness, spontaneous abortion, or maternal death, preterm birth.\nIn this case, we reported that a mother with COVID-19 gave birth to a healthy baby with no evidence of COVID-19 during her 30 weeks pregnancy. Our case ended up with an uneventful postpartum and neonatal course. The RT-PCR tests were all negative, suggesting the infant was unaffected by COVID-19, and all healthcare workers taking care of him had remained asymptomatic.\nSeveral reasons might have contributed to the uneventful perinatal course. First of all, this patient was a healthy young woman without special medical history, and regular follow-ups in obstetrics clinic reveled that she and the fetus were healthy before this infection. And early detection of COVID-19 and late stage of gestation were also essential. Secondly, our medical center was a designated hospital for COVID-19 in Suzhou since the virus outbreak in China, and all the health care workers received systemic training for strict isolation and protection measures, such as use of protective equipment, hand hygiene, safe waste management, environmental cleaning, and sterilization of medical equipment, and followed the correct procedures during medical practice. Much experience has been accumulating in the past few weeks from dozens of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, including a 19-month old boy, the youngest patient in Suzhou to date. The patient in our case was ideally cared for by a multidisciplinary medical team, including obstetrics, pediatrics, infectious diseases, anesthesia, ICU, nosocomial infection control expert, and administrative staff. Timely and effective consultations were obtained to discuss her case. Last but not least, careful transmission precautions to the infant, including contact, droplet, and airborne seem to be of great significance. Given the high infectivity and undefined transmission mode, some infection-control protocols applicable for the operating room were developed for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Some infected cases in China demonstrated viral shedding in feces, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might be present in other body parts, so those precautions during delivery were necessary in case transmission during delivery exists.\nOur case provides an initial view of the outcome associated with pregnancy-related COVID-19, and several effective strategies for managing pregnant women with COVID-19. Comprehensive data on larger numbers of gravid women with COVID-19 are required to better understanding the overall impact of SARS-CoV-2 on maternal and birth outcomes.

The team formulated various measures: reconfiguration of the radiology department, personal protection and training of staff, examination procedures for patients suspected of or confirmed with COVID-19 as well as patients without an exposure history or symptoms. Those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection were scanned in the designated fever-CT unit. people suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 underwent fever-CT examinations. Including initial examinations and re-examinations, the total number of fever-CT examinations numbered 3,340. As a result of our precautions, none of the staff of the radiology department were infected with COVID-19.\n Conclusion: Strategic planning and adequate protections can help protect patients and staff against a highly infectious disease while maintaining function at a high-volume capacity.\n The radiology department was divided into four areas [5]: contaminated, semicontaminated, buffer, and clean areas (Fig. 1) . The contaminated area is connected to the fever clinic and includes the fever access way, the CT examination room, and the DR examination room for confirmed and suspected cases.

The technologists on fever-CT duty shifts are provided a break once a week for 4 hours. In addition, the health of staff in the contaminated area must be monitored closely for the symptoms of COVID-19. Pregnant staff must be assigned to the clean area.\nThe EMICT formulates and continually updates guidelines and educates all staff for West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The EMICT training for staff is mainly involves documents regarding infection control and CT findings of COVID-19 and maintains an EMICT WeChat Q6 group for West China Hospital of Sichuan University. WeChat is the most widely used social media app in China. The EMICT releases the latest national and hospital-based information regarding COVID-19, guidance documents, and other notices from the hospital and radiology department in the WeChat group on a daily basis. Staff can also report to the EMICT in the WeChat group any time. Protocols for each modality and infection control instructions are posted on the walls in all examination rooms. The EMICT periodically reminds staff to undertake personal measures to reduce infection, such as wearing masks at all instances in the radiology department and N95 masks if working in the contaminated area; not touching the mask and the eyes; practicing hand hygiene; facing away from colleagues when eating, drinking, and talking; and not using personal cellular telephones while on duty. 211  212  213  214  215  216  217  218  219  220  221  222  223  224  225  226  227  228  229  230  231  232  233  234  235  236  237  238  239  240  241  242  243  244  245  246  247  248  249  250  251  252  253  254  255  256  257  258  259  260  261  262   263  264  265  266  267  268  269  270  271  272  273  274  275  276  277  278  279  280  281  282  283  284  285  286  287  288  289  290  291  292  293  294  295  296  297  298  299  300  301  302  303  304  305  306  307  308  309  310  311  312  313  314 In addition, the chief thoracic radiologist provided lectures on all radiologists and technologists on typical CT findings of COVID-19 infection using materials developed in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak in China.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-24","authors_x":"Huang, Zixing; Zhao, Shuang; Li, Zhenlin; Chen, Weixia; Zhao, Lihong; Deng, Lipeng; Song, Bin","journal_x":"Journal of the American College of Radiology","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.jacr.2020.03.011","H index_x":48.0,"section":"Personal Protection and Training of Staff","total_rank":0.140167364,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[768],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":1,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],[],[],[],["health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"dbe8a104fe4a13db90f1222cfe209aaa292b5313","title_x":"Journal Pre-proof ASE Statement on Protection of Patients and Echocardiography Service Providers During the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak ASE Statement on Protection of Patients and Echocardiography Service Providers During the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak","abstract_x":"Duke University, Durham, North Carolina (M.S.).\n This statement reflects recommendations based on expert opinion, national guidelines, and available evidence.

[1] Healthcare workers are at higher risk since this virus is very easily spread, especially through the kind of close contact involved in the performance of echocardiographic studies. The virus carries relatively high mortality and morbidity risk, particularly for certain populations (the elderly, the chronically ill, the immunocompromised and, possibly, pregnant women). [2] Given the risk of cardiovascular complications in the setting of COVID-19, including pre-existing cardiac disease, acute cardiac injury, and drug-related myocardial damage, [3] echocardiographic services will likely be required in the care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Consequently, echo providers will be exposed to SARS-CoV-2.\nSonographers, nurses, advance practice providers and physicians have a duty to care for patients and are at the frontlines in the battle against disease. We are at high risk, particularly when we participate in the care of patients who are suspected or confirmed to have highly contagious diseases. While dedication to patient care is at the heart of our profession, we also have a duty to care for ourselves and our loved ones and to protect all of our patients by preventing the spread of disease. This means reducing our own risk while practicing judicious use of personal protective equipment (PPE).\nASE is committed to the health, safety and wellbeing of our members and the patients we serve.

In the presents study, all the patients were died of respiratory failure, which J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f indicated that the lung is the most common target organ of SARS-CoV-2.\nMultiple organ dysfunction could also be observed, the most common organ damage outside the lungs was the heart, followed by kidney and liver. The results demonstrated that the death of the patient may be primarily related to impaired cardiopulmonary function. All the patients' albumin levels and 80% and 68% of patients' RBC and Hb levels were decreased, which indicates that malnutrition is common to severe patients.\nCOVID-19 is a viral disease characterized by normal or low white blood cell count and decreased lymphocyte count 10 . In this study, increased white blood cell and neutrophils count were observed in 68% and 72% of patients. In addition, PCT levels were elevated in 90.5% of patients. PCT is sensitive indicator of bacterial infection 11 . The results indicated that bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients.\nCRP is a useful marker and gauge of inflammation, it plays an important role in host defense against invading pathogens as well as in inflammation 12 . SAA is a plasma protein that transports lipids during inflammation 13 . In the present study, CRP and SAA were elevated before death in 85% and 100% of patients, suggesting that there is a severe inflammatory cascade in patients with COVID-19.\nIn order to screen out biochemical indicators that are meaningful for the diagnosis of disease This was a small sample size retrospective study, which was limited by the small numbers of patients and by using a retrospective method. In particular, some important laboratory results were incomplete.\nIn conclusion, the age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) is the most FY and JZ made substantial contributions to data acquisition, analysis and interpretation. SY and LX reviewed the data. ZG made substantial revisions to the manuscript.","publish_time_x":"2020-04-03","authors_x":"Li, Xun; Wang, Luwen; Yan, Shaonan; Yang, Fan; Xiang, Longkui; Zhu, Jiling; Shen, Bo; Gong, Zuojiong","journal_x":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.ijid.2020.03.053","H index_x":73.0,"section":"Discussion","total_rank":0.134122288,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[286,2589],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":2,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["analysi","analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["retrospective study"],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk"],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"9fa2250f9b2b5206713ddfa6945088f971ceecd4","title_x":"Pulmonary Pathology of Early-Phase 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia in Two Patients With Lung Cancer","abstract_x":"There is currently a lack of pathologic data on the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pneumonia, or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), from autopsy or biopsy.

The number of confirmed cases in the People's Republic of China has reached 42,700, including 1017 deaths, as of February 11, 2020 (new reference, website). Although patients initially present with fever with or without respiratory symptoms, various degrees of pulmonary abnormalities develop later in all patients, and these can be seen on chest computed tomography (CT) imaging. 1, 3 Most patients only have a common, mild form of illness, but approximately 15% to 20% fall in the severe group, meaning they require assisted oxygenation as part of treatment. 3 The severe group has a high mortality rate and is associated with older age, underlying diseases such as diabetes, and medical procedures (such as patients who were infected in a hospital setting while undergoing an operation for other indications).\nAlthough there have been several studies describing clinical features and characteristic radiographic findings (mainly chest CT scans), 1,3 no pathologic studies have been conducted on the basis of autopsies or biopsies. Some of the reasons for the lack of autopsies and biopsies include suddenness of the outbreak, vast patient volume in hospitals, shortage of health care personnel, and high rate of transmission, which makes invasive diagnostic procedures less of a clinical priority.\nFortunately and unfortunately, we encountered two patients who underwent an operation for malignancy and were later found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. The operation overlapped in time with the infection, which allowed us to obtain the necessary specimens to examine the histopathology of COVID-19 pneumonia.","publish_time_x":"2020-02-28","authors_x":"Tian, Sufang; Hu, Weidong; Niu, Li; Liu, Huan; Xu, Haibo; Xiao, Shu-Yuan","journal_x":"Journal of Thoracic Oncology","doi_x":"10.1016\/j.jtho.2020.02.010","H index_x":113.0,"section":"","total_rank":0.18767507,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[1042],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak","outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age"],[],[],["health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"9fa2250f9b2b5206713ddfa6945088f971ceecd4","title_x":"Pulmonary Pathology of Early-Phase 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia in Two Patients With Lung Cancer","abstract_x":"There is currently a lack of pathologic data on the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pneumonia, or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), from autopsy or biopsy.

The tumor was discovered on a chest CT scan at an outside hospital. She had a medical history of hypertension for 30 years and type II diabetes. On day 6 of hospitalization, an enhanced chest CT scan was performed that confirmed an irregular solid nodule in the right middle lobe and bilateral ground-glass opacity (GGO). At that time, the significance of the latter findings was unknown. Her general condition was good, with no fever or respiratory symptoms, and with clear lung sounds on auscultation bilaterally. She underwent presurgical tests and preparations. On day 12, a thoracoscopic resection of the right middle lobe was performed without event. On day 13 (postoperative day 1), a repeat CT scan revealed postresection changes and bilateral GGO in the lower lobes of the lungs (Fig. 1A) . White blood cell (WBC) count was 12.49 \u00c2 10 12 \/liter, whereas lymphocyte count decreased to 0.4 \u00c2 10 9 \/liter and the differential to 5%. There was a slight wheezing sound on auscultation on the right side. On day 16, the patient experienced some difficulty in breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, and dry cough. She received a diagnosis \"suggestive of viral pneumonia,\" with intermittent peripheral capillary oxygen saturation between 72% and 88%. On day 24, she was transferred to a special isolation ward owing to a pharyngeal swab test result that was positive for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Laboratory specimens drawn on the previous day (day 23) revealed the following: increased WBC count to 33.52 \u00c2 10 9 \/liter; increased neutrophils to 89.80%; decreased lymphocytes to 1.90%; decreased eosinophils to 0%; increased neutrophil count to 30.10 \u00c2 10 9 \/liter; decreased lymphocyte count to 0.65 \u00c2 10 9 \/liter; increased monocyte count to 2.50 \u00c2 10 9 \/liter; decreased eosinophil count to 0.01 \u00c2 10 9 \/liter; and increased basophil count to 0.26 \u00c2 10 9 \/liter. Despite comprehensive treatment, including antibiotics, assisted oxygenation, and other supportive care, the patient's condition deteriorated. Her peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) decreased to 62.6% and heart rate to 40 bpm. A do-not-resuscitate order was given. She went into coma on day 27 and died on day 29. She did not manifest fever during the hospital stay.\nSubsequent clinical information confirmed that she was exposed to another patient in the same room who was subsequently found to be infected with the 2019-nCoV.\nThe right middle lobe resection specimen was delivered to the surgical pathology laboratory and processed according to the routine biosafety standards. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were reviewed. A firm area of 1.5 cm in diameter was identified grossly, which in the histologic diagnosis was consistent with typical adenocarcinoma, with half exhibiting a lepidic and half an acinar pattern (not revealed). Sections away from the tumor, as found in Figure 2 , revealed evident alveolar damage, including alveolar edema and proteinaceous exudates ( Fig. 2A) . Prominent inspissated spherical secretions or globules were also noted (Fig. 2B ). There was vascular congestion but patchy and mild inflammatory infiltration. Focal fibrin clusters mixed with mononuclear inflammatory cells and multinucleated giant cells were noted in the airspaces (Fig. 2C) . No significant neutrophil infiltration was present in the tissue. There was patchy and severe pneumocyte hyperplasia and interstitial thickening, indicating an ongoing reparative process.

Objective: We present some remarkable imaging findings of the first two patients identified in Italy with COVID-19 infection travelling from Wuhan, China. The follow-up with chest X-Rays and CT scans was also included, showing a progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Results: Moderate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up, apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration. Another uncommon element was the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with short-axis oval nodes. Conclusions: Although only two patients have been studied, these findings are consistent with the radiological pattern described in literature. Finally, the pulmonary vessels enlargement in areas where new lung infiltrates develop in the follow-up CT scan, could describe an early predictor radiological sign of lung impairment.","text_body":"Our findings are specific only to two patients with a very short time interval between the follow-up CT scans, thus further studies are required to define the specific nature and importance of our findings.

She had a terminal of pregnancy due to chromosome abnormalities in 2016. She is allergic to penicillin and first-generation cephalosporin (positive in skin test).\nAt 20:00 on February 1, 2020, the 40-week gestation pregnant woman developed small amount of per vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain. Two hours later, she developed a fever (37.8 \u2103) and attended to Wuhan women and children medical care center for medical advice. As she was febrile, she was referred to the fever clinic of Wuhan Tongji Hospital the next morning. Thoracic computerized tomography scan showed ground-glass opacities in the left upper and lower lobes, indicating the possibility of viral pneumonia (Fig. 1 ). Blood tests revealed lymphopenia (0.97\u00d710 9 \/L, normal: 1.1-3.2\u00d710 9 \/L), neutrophilia (9.97\u00d710 9 \/L, normal: 1.8-6.3\u00d710 9 \/L), and elevated hs-CRP level (11.5mg\/L, normal: <1 mg\/L ). She was hospitalized for suspected viral pneumonia On admission, her body temperature was 37.8 \u2103 and her blood pressure was 131\/89 mmHg, with respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, pulse of 96 beats per minute. She had no cough or sputum. Fetal heart rate (FHR) was 136 bpm and fetal heart monitoring showed no abnormality. Emergency Cesarean section was performed. Meconium-stained liquor was noted intra-operatively. At 08:45,a baby boy was delivered, weighted 3205g. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were 8 and 9. The infant had no moaning or spitting after birth. The skin was ruddy and the crying was loud. The mother had been wearing an N95 mask throughout the operation, and the baby had no contact with the mother after birth. The infant was transferred to neonatology department 10 minutes after birth for close observation and the mother was transferred to the fever ward for isolation after surgery.\nHalf an hour after birth, the infant vomitted once after feeding formula, which we considered to be swallowing syndrome. After gastric lavage, the infant could be fed normally.\nBlood tests of the neonate revealed lymphopenia (2.43\u00d710 9 \/L, normal: 3-8\u00d710 9 \/L), deranged liver function tests (AST 143U\/L , normal: \u226441 U\/L.

Intravenous penicillin G (15wu q.d, intravenous bolus) and vitamin K1 (1mg q.d, intravenously) were given as antibiotic prophylaxis and to prevent coagulopathy, respectively.\nThe mother was well and afebrile during the immediate post-operative period. She had no cough or any other discomfort such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Her vital signs were stable with blood oxygen saturation of 99%. Antiviral treatment including 40 \u03bcg of recombinant human interferon \u03b11b atomized inhalation with 2 mL of sterilization injection water was used twice a day, and ganciclovir (0\u00b725 g every 12 h, intravenously). Abipenem (0.3g every 12 h, intravenously) and moxifloxacin (0.4g q.d, intravenously) were used for anti-infection. The mother had intermittent fever on the first postoperative day with the highest temperature up to 38.3 \u00b0 C. She was given methylprednisolone(20mg intravenously ). Her pharyngeal swab sampled for SARS-CoV-2 reported back as positive later that day.\nPharyngeal swab specimen was collected immediately from the infant (36 hours after birth), along with the breast milk of the mother. We recommended the mother not to breastfeed and empty the breast milk to avoid mastitis.\nThe mental response of the newborn was acceptable the first day after birth and his blood oxygen saturation maintained above 92% without supplyment of oxygen. On February 4, the second day after the surgery, the mother's vitals were stable and she was given methylprednisolone(40mg q.d, intravenously). The neonate was well and his blood gas analysis showed: PH 7. On February 5, the newborn's vital signs were stable with the blood oxygen saturation maintained above 90%, with no discomfort such as apnea or vomiting. The result of pharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive at 36 hours after birth. Combining all the laboratory results with fully discussion, we made a diagnosis that the infant was confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since the neonatal department of Tongji Hospital did not have the isolation conditions for the diagnosed newborn, he was transferred to Wuhan Children's Hospital for further isolation later that day. After finding evidence of neonatal infection, we performed nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 on cord blood and placenta specimens that we retained during the operation, and the results were negative. The mother's breast milk sample was negative for SARS-CoV-2 as well.\nWe followed up the newborn's condition after he was transferred to Wuhan Children's Hospital. He was well and afebrile with no cough or vomiting. He was closely monitored in isolation and no special treatment was given. Chest CT on Feb 6 showed high-density nodular shadow under the pleura of the posterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung.\nChest CT on Feb 12 showed that the upper lobe and lower lobe of the right lung were scattered with small pieces of patchy shadow.

When pregnant women become infected with viral pneumonia, they are more likely to have complications and progress to severe cases [8] . A study in Hong Kong in 2004\nshows that SARS during pregnancy is associated with high incidences of spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth restriction [9] . Another study shows that pregnant women with pneumonia have an increased risk of developing low birth weight infants, preterm births, restricted fetal growth, and 5-minute Apgar score <7 compared to healthy pregnant women [10] . Although there have been no clinical or serological reports of SARS or MERS in neonatal infections in existing studies [9, 17] , evidence of vertical motherto-child transmission in other respiratory viruses such as H1N1 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have been reported [11] .\nThere have been several studies concerning intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 and its effects on newborns [12, 13] . All the newborns of COVID-19 infected mothers in these cases were negative for nucleic acid test and one study shows that COVID-19 may have adverse effects on newborns, causing problems such as fetal distress, premature labor, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function, and even death [13] .\nWe report the first case of neonatal COVID-19 infection in China whose mother was confirmed with COVID-19. The clinical manifestations of the mother and the baby were both mild and the baby's prognosis was well. Whether the case is intrauterine vertical transmission or not remains controversial. Although the results of nucleic acid detection of cord blood and placenta in this case are negative, which do not support the diagnosis of intrauterine transmission, but the possibility of vertical intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not ruled out. The reasons are as follows: 1) When the viral load is not high enough, the detection rate of existing methods is limited and false negatives may occur. Therefore, the negative results of umbilical cord blood and placental nucleic acid during the operation do not exclude the possibility of false negatives. 2) According to the clinical manifestations, the pregnant woman first had fever symptoms at 22:00 on February 1. However, the CT result after a few hours showed ground-glass opacities in the left upper and lower lobes, suggesting that the pregnant woman may have been asymptomatic in the early stage. Since we lack the data of maternal viral load, there is no evidence whether the fetus has been infected with maternal viremia in utero before the mother had any clinical manifestation.3) In addition to this case, neonatal infections have been reported in other provinces and cities in China [14] . The possibility of mother-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out.\nWe also discussed whether the newborn is a nosocomial infection.

Four corona viruses namely HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43 have been in circulation in humans, and generally cause mild respiratory disease.\nThere have been two events in the past two decades wherein crossover of animal betacorona viruses to humans has resulted in severe disease. The first such instance was in 2002-2003 when a new coronavirus of the \u03b2 genera and with origin in bats crossed over to humans via the intermediary host of palm civet cats in the Guangdong province of China. This virus, designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus affected 8422 people mostly in China and Hong Kong and caused 916 deaths (mortality rate 11%) before being contained [4] . Almost a decade later in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), also of bat origin, emerged in Saudi Arabia with dromedary camels as the intermediate host and affected 2494 people and caused 858 deaths (fatality rate 34%) [5] .\nOrigin and Spread of COVID-19 [1, 2, 6] In December 2019, adults in Wuhan, capital city of Hubei province and a major transportation hub of China started presenting to local hospitals with severe pneumonia of unknown cause. Many of the initial cases had a common exposure to the Huanan wholesale seafood market that also traded live animals. The surveillance system (put into place after the SARS outbreak) was activated and respiratory samples of patients were sent to reference labs for etiologic investigations. On December 31st 2019, China notified the outbreak to the World Health Organization and on 1st January the Huanan sea food market was closed. On 7th January the virus was identified as a coronavirus that had >95% homology with the bat coronavirus and > 70% similarity with the SARS-CoV. Environmental samples from the Huanan sea food market also tested positive, signifying that the virus originated from there [7] . The number of cases started increasing exponentially, some of which did not have exposure to the live animal market, suggestive of the fact that human-to-human transmission was occurring [8] . The first fatal case was reported on 11th Jan 2020. The massive migration of Chinese during the Chinese New Year fuelled the epidemic. Cases in other provinces of China, other countries (Thailand, Japan and South Korea in quick succession) were reported in people who were returning from Wuhan. Transmission to healthcare workers caring for patients was described on 20th Jan, 2020. By 23rd January, the 11 million population of Wuhan was placed under lock down with restrictions of entry and exit from the region. Soon this lock down was extended to other cities of Hubei province. Cases of COVID-19 in countries outside China were reported in those with no history of travel to China suggesting that local human-to-human transmission was occurring in these countries [9] . Airports in different countries including India put in screening mechanisms to detect symptomatic people returning from China and placed them in isolation and testing them for COVID-19. Soon it was apparent that the infection could be transmitted from asymptomatic people and also before onset of symptoms. Therefore, countries including India who evacuated their citizens from Wuhan through special flights or had travellers returning from China, placed all people symptomatic or otherwise in isolation for 14 d and tested them for the virus.\nCases continued to increase exponentially and modelling studies reported an epidemic doubling time of 1.8 d [10] . In fact on the 12th of February, China changed its definition of confirmed cases to include patients with negative\/ pending molecular tests but with clinical, radiologic and epidemiologic features of COVID-19 leading to an increase in cases by 15,000 in a single day [6] . As of 05\/03\/2020 96,000 cases worldwide (80,000 in China) and 87 other countries and 1 international conveyance (696, in the cruise ship Diamond Princess parked off the coast of Japan) have been reported [2] . It is important to note that while the number of new cases has reduced in China lately, they have increased exponentially in other countries including South Korea, Italy and Iran. Of those infected, 20% are in critical condition, 25% have recovered, and 3310 (3013 in China and 297 in other countries) have died [2] . India, which had reported only 3 cases till 2\/3\/ 2020, has also seen a sudden spurt in cases. By 5\/3\/2020, 29 cases had been reported; mostly in Delhi, Jaipur and Agra in Italian tourists and their contacts. One case was reported in an Indian who traveled back from Vienna and exposed a large number of school children in a birthday party at a city hotel. Many of the contacts of these cases have been quarantined.\nThese numbers are possibly an underestimate of the infected and dead due to limitations of surveillance and testing. Though the SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats, the intermediary animal through which it crossed over to humans is uncertain. Pangolins and snakes are the current suspects.\nEpidemiology and Pathogenesis [10, 11] All ages are susceptible. Infection is transmitted through large droplets generated during coughing and sneezing by symptomatic patients but can also occur from asymptomatic people and before onset of symptoms [9] . Studies have shown higher viral loads in the nasal cavity as compared to the throat with no difference in viral burden between symptomatic and asymptomatic people [12] . Patients can be infectious for as long as the symptoms last and even on clinical recovery. Some people may act as super spreaders; a UK citizen who attended a conference in Singapore infected 11 other people while staying in a resort in the French Alps and upon return to the UK [6] . These infected droplets can spread 1-2 m and deposit on surfaces. The virus can remain viable on surfaces for days in favourable atmospheric conditions but are destroyed in less than a minute by common disinfectants like sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide etc. [13] . Infection is acquired either by inhalation of these droplets or touching surfaces contaminated by them and then touching the nose, mouth and eyes. The virus is also present in the stool and contamination of the water supply and subsequent transmission via aerosolization\/ feco oral route is also hypothesized [6] . As per current information, transplacental transmission from pregnant women to their fetus has not been described [14] . However, neonatal disease due to post natal transmission is described [14] . The incubation period varies from 2 to 14 d [median 5 d] . Studies have identified angiotensin receptor 2 (ACE 2 ) as the receptor through which the virus enters the respiratory mucosa [11] .\nThe basic case reproduction rate (BCR) is estimated to range from 2 to 6.47 in various modelling studies [11] . In comparison, the BCR of SARS was 2 and 1.3 for pandemic flu H1N1 2009 [2] .\nClinical Features [8, [15] [16] [17] [18] The clinical features of COVID-19 are varied, ranging from asymptomatic state to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi organ dysfunction. The common clinical features include fever (not in all), cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, headache, myalgia and breathlessness. Conjunctivitis has also been described. Thus, they are indistinguishable from other respiratory infections. In a subset of patients, by the end of the first week the disease can progress to pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. This progression is associated with extreme rise in inflammatory cytokines including IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 [15] . The median time from onset of symptoms to dyspnea was 5 d, hospitalization 7 d and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 8 d. The need for intensive care admission was in 25-30% of affected patients in published series. Complications witnessed included acute lung injury, ARDS, shock and acute kidney injury. Recovery started in the 2nd or 3rd wk. The median duration of hospital stay in those who recovered was 10 d. Adverse outcomes and death are more common in the elderly and those with underlying co-morbidities (50-75% of fatal cases). Fatality rate in hospitalized adult patients ranged from 4 to 11%. The overall case fatality rate is estimated to range between 2 and 3% [2] .\nInterestingly, disease in patients outside Hubei province has been reported to be milder than those from Wuhan [17] . Similarly, the severity and case fatality rate in patients outside China has been reported to be milder [6] . This may either be due to selection bias wherein the cases reporting from Wuhan included only the severe cases or due to predisposition of the Asian population to the virus due to higher expression of ACE 2 receptors on the respiratory mucosa [11] .\nDisease in neonates, infants and children has been also reported to be significantly milder than their adult counterparts. In a series of 34 children admitted to a hospital in Shenzhen, China between January 19th and February 7th, there were 14 males and 20 females. The median age was 8 y 11 mo and in 28 children the infection was linked to a family member and 26 children had history of travel\/residence to Hubei province in China. All the patients were either asymptomatic (9%) or had mild disease. No severe or critical cases were seen. The most common symptoms were fever (50%) and cough (38%). All patients recovered with symptomatic therapy and there were no deaths. One case of severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction in a child has also been reported [19] . Similarly the neonatal cases that have been reported have been mild [20] .","publish_time_x":"2020-03-13","authors_x":"Singhal, Tanu","journal_x":"Indian J Pediatr","doi_x":"10.1007\/s12098-020-03263-6","H index_x":null,"section":"History","total_rank":0.0364130435,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[6590],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":1,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact","contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["investigati"],["model","model"],["outbreak","outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],["range","range","range"],["duration"],["asymptomatic","asymptomatic","asymptomatic","asymptomatic","asymptomatic"],["infecti","Infecti","infecti","Infecti","infecti","infecti"],["reproducti"],["route"],["age","age"],[],[],["Health","health"],[],[],[],["incub"],["generat"],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"4ad5a1ef0e00bd793a408c7915c6e207f360138f","title_x":"Original Article Myoung-don Oh , 3 and on behalf of the Korea National Committee for Clinical Management of COVID-19 Clinical Course and Outcomes of Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: a Preliminary Report of the First 28 Patients from the Korean Cohort Study on COVID-19","abstract_x":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019.

In detail, of 74 patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 53 patients had only the symptom of diarrhoea, 11 patients had only the symptom of vomiting and 10 patients had only the symptom of nausea. In addition, only three patients had all the GI symptoms of diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea, while four patients had the symptoms of both nausea and vomiting. Diarrhoea was the most common GI symptom in this study and accounted for 8.14% of the total enrolled 651 patients with COVID-19, which was higher than the rate of 3.8% reported previously. 14 Of 53 patients with COVID-19 with diarrhoea, the median duration period was 4 days (IQR: 3-6 days), with the shortest duration of 1 day and longest of 9 days. Most diarrhoea was self-limiting. The average age of the patients with GI symptoms was 46.14\u00b114.19 years and the male:female ratio was 1:1. There were no coexisting conditions of cancer, chronic renal disease, pregnancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or immunosuppression.

These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.","text_body":"Coronavirus is a highly contagious pathogen found in several domestic animals, pets, and humans, causing a variety of acute and chronic diseases. [6] Currently, six coronaviruses are known to infect humans, including 229E and NLR6 in the \u03b1-genus. The \u03b2-genus comprises OC43, HKU1, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERSr-CoV), [7] and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). [8] Coronavirus has gradually become a popular topic of research in the field of virology because of the outbreak of SARSr-CoV in 2003 and MERSr-CoV in 2012. [9] The current outbreak is due to a novel coronavirus in the \u03b2-genus, which was isolated from the lower respiratory tract in patients with unexplained pneumonia, in Wuhan, China. [10, 11] Currently, the source and pathogenesis of the COVID-19 remain unclear, and there are no uniform diagnostic and treatment standards. Unfortunately, in certain patients, the disease progresses rapidly, and respiratory failure can occur within a short time, even leading to death. Therefore, we investigated the disease outcomes and factors affecting the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at three tertiary hospitals in Wuhan to provide a theoretical basis for improving hospitals' efforts to effectively treat patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.\nThe present study included 78 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19. All patients were evaluated for therapeutic efficacy after at least two weeks of hospitalization. These results indicated progression in 11 patients (14.1%) and improvement\/stabilization in 67 patients (85.9%). 80.8% of the patients were younger than 60 years, and the median age of the patients was 38 (33, 57) years, which suggest that middle-aged people are susceptible to COVID-19. Also, the age of patients in the progression group was significantly higher than that in the improvement\/stabilization group, and multivariate logistic analysis indicated that higher age was a risk factor for disease progression. Elderly individuals are physically frail and are likely to have several comorbidities, which not only increases the risk of pneumonia [12] but also affects their prognosis [13] . the assessment of comorbidities is an essential component in determining the prognosis of several diseases, especially pneumonia. [14] Probably because of the small sample size, there was no significant difference in any comorbidity including hypertension, diabetes, COPD, cancer, and others between the two groups. The potential impact of comorbidities on the disease outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requires further observation and research. The proportion of patients with a history of smoking was significantly higher in the progression group compared to the improvement\/stabilization group, suggesting that smoking is associated with disease progression.\nA significant symptom of SARS is a body temperature above 38\u00b0C for over two weeks.\nAdditionally, 60% of patients diagnosed with MERS presented with fever. [15] In the present study, 73.1% of patients with COVID-19 sought treatment for the fever. The results showed that the maximum body temperature at admission in the progression group was significantly higher than in the improvement\/stabilization group, and multivariate logistic models indicated that higher temperature was a risk factor for disease progression. Therefore, patients presenting with a high fever, long fever duration, and rapid fever progression should be monitored more closely during clinical diagnosis and treatment in order to avoid complications associated with high fevers, which lead to poor prognosis.\nVital signs are essential indicators for assessing the current symptoms of patients. Respiratory system indices, such as respiratory rate and whether respiratory failure occurred, are particularly crucial for assessing the condition severity in patients with COVID-19. The present study found that the median respiratory rate of 78 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was 24 breaths\/min, which was higher than the normal respiratory rate (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) breaths\/min). The respiratory rate and proportion of patients with respiratory failure in the progression group were significantly higher than in the improvement\/stabilization group.\nAbnormal respiratory indices can directly reflect the extent of lung invasion and multivariate logistic models revealed that respiratory failure was a risk factor for disease progression.\nTherefore, respiratory indices should be one of the top priorities in the efficacy evaluation.\nThe present study suggests that elevated C-reactive protein, and decreased albumin are factors associated with poor prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Albumin is the most intuitive index of the nutritional status of the body. When albumin decreases, the body loses resistance to the virus, leading to disease progression . [16] Elevated C-reactive protein is an important inflammatory index in addition to abnormal blood coagulation function. Close monitoring of dynamic changes in these indices has a significant proactive effect on understanding changes in the patient's condition. In addition, studies have shown that lymphocytes are the main target cells of viral infections. [17] Viral infections in the human body primarily involve damage to the immune system, which presents as decrease in the absolute number of lymphocytes . [18] The present study did not find these indices significant for assessing the outcome of COVID-19 patients, and their correlation requires further investigation. This study included CT scan characteristics of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia for analysis and suggested that the extent and characteristics of the lesion had no statistical significance on disease outcomes. However, the use of CT scans at earlier stages for disease assessment is still of great significance for early detection, early diagnosis, and improved prognosis.\nAppropriate antibiotic treatment can be administered to prevent secondary infection in critical type viral pneumonia. [19] We analyzed the diagnosis and treatment protocols of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and results suggested that some patients undergoing antiviral treatment were also proactively undergoing antibacterial treatment. Whether viral pneumonia should be treated with glucocorticoids has been controversial. Some researchers believe that the use of glucocorticoids in viral pneumonia can easily aggravate the disease and increase the risk of secondary infections, leading to an increase in mortality, thus advocating against the use of glucocorticoids. [20] Other studies have suggested that the use of an appropriate dose of glucocorticoids at early stages could inhibit the elevated secretion of inflammatory cytokines due to excessive activation of immune cells because of the viral infection, thereby preventing continued exacerbation of lung injury . [21] We found that the combination of antivirals, antibacterials, and glucocorticoids had the highest use rate in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Moreover, other researchers have suggested using thymosin and gamma globulin during the early stages of infection to improve patient immunity. In addition, current ongoing related studies suggest that COVID-19 and HIV have structural similarities.\nThus, certain researchers have proposed that the anti-HIV drug, lopinavir, may play a role in inhibiting COVID-19. In this study, a comparison of efficacy of antivirals\/antibacterials, antivirals\/antibacterials + glucocorticoids, antivirals\/antibacterials + gamma globulin, antivirals\/antibacterial + thymosins, and antivirals\/antibacterials + lopinavir was performed.\nThe results did not suggest that drug protocols affected disease outcomes. Therefore, further studies should include more drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. COVID-19 pneumonia is characterized by an acute onset and rapid progression. Therefore, the early use of glucocorticoids with proactive antiviral and antibacterial treatment after comprehensive evaluation may block the inflammatory cascade caused by severe viral infections and prevent acute inflammation. The lung damage caused by such infections can further progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Respiratory support is an essential treatment for patients with severe viral infections. The present study revealed that all patients with COVID-19 were treated with respiratory support, and the majority of patients were administered nasal cannula oxygen and continuous positive air pressure. The progression group was significantly more likely to receive higher levels of respiratory support. No patients in this study were treated with invasive ventilation and ECMO due to the refusal of the patients' family. Treating patients with severe viral pneumonia, timely application of glucocorticoids and respiratory support therapy is essential, in combination with personalized treatment specific to each patient.\nThere were a few limitations for this observational study. CT scan imaging has delayed scanning time, which may introduce bias in our results. In addition, a relatively small sample size was included in this study, which may lead to biased results. Thus, a multi-center largescale study with additional researchers is required. Currently, the best diagnostic and treatment protocols for COVID-19 are still being investigated.

Methods: Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens. Results: None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Major initial symptoms included fever (112\/137, 81.8%), coughing (66\/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44\/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache. Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99\/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cordlike shadows. Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions. Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits. Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis. The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea.

It is planned that a later version of this document will be submitted for peer-reviewed publication, but in the interests of sharing information during a rapidly changing epidemic landscape, we are making this early version available.\n We estimate the growth in demand for ICU beds in Chicago during the emerging COVID-19 epidemic, using state-of-the-art computer simulations calibrated for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The questions we address are these:\n (1) Will the ICU capacity in Chicago be exceeded, and if so by how much?\n (2) Can strong mitigation strategies, such as lockdown or shelter in place order, prevent the overflow of capacity?\n (3) When should such strategies be implemented?\n Our answers are as follows:\n (1) The ICU capacity may be exceeded by a large amount, probably by a factor of ten.\n (2) Strong mitigation can avert this emergency situation potentially, but even that will not work if implemented too late.\n (3) If the strong mitigation precedes April 1 st , then the growth of COVID-19 can be controlled and the ICU capacity could be adequate. The earlier the strong mitigation is implemented, the greater the probability that it will be successful. After around April 1 2020, any strong mitigation will not avert the emergency situation. In Italy, the lockdown occurred too late and the number of deaths is still doubling every 2.3 days. It is difficult to be sure about the precise dates for this window of opportunity, due to the inherent uncertainties in computer simulation. But there is high confidence in the main conclusion that it exists and will soon be closed.\n Our conclusion is that, being fully cognizant of the societal trade-offs, there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avert a worst-case scenario in Chicago, but only with strong mitigation\/lockdown implemented in the next week at the latest. If this window is missed, the epidemic will get worse and then strong mitigation\/lockdown will be required after all, but it will be too late.","text_body":"This document describes the results of computer simulations of a standard population level epidemiological model (SEIR-model) with seasonal affects and parameters calibrated to be appropriate for SARS-CoV-2. The calculations are done by solving differential equations of the SEIR model [1] , without spatial extension, demographic stochasticity or attention paid to smallworld and scale-free network effects, but these are potentially important and [2, 3] could be readily added in the future [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The model additionally has categories for severely sick people who are hospitalized, people in critical condition in need of ICU rooms and ventilators, and a fatal category. The simulation uses severity assumptions as a function of individual age, informed by epidemiological and clinical observations in China [9] ; no modifications have been to take into account national differences, such as number of smokers in the population etc.\nThe model has been calibrated with the hospital data in the Chicago area and is able to account for the rapid rise in COVID-19 patients that we are starting to see (see Figure 1 ). Here is how we performed calibration. The simulation needs a starting assumed number of cases, and we initially used the value 100. Here is why. Previously we had estimated that the Chicago community cluster was 1600 infected individuals on March 14 2020. The way we did that estimate was to work backwards from the number of ICU confirmed covid-19 patients at a major Chicago hospital (5 confirmed, 110 persons under investigation (PUIs) but 10% of those will turn out to be covid-19 positive). Then we used the doubling time of 2.3 days which was true at that time, and used a 20% hospitalization rate for covid-19 patients, with a time interval between infection and hospitalization of 9.9 days. Then we found that this cluster originated around February 19 2020.\nHowever, we were not satisfied with this argument, because it predicted the first covid-19 confirmed case would be too late. To do this, we experimented with moving the starting time of the simulation with one infected individual, and found that this would work if the date of infection was February 16 th 2020. Reassuringly, this date is roughly consistent with the working backwards calculation! We ran the simulations with this initial condition: one infection event on Feb 16 th 2020. Starting with this value, our simulations predicted that on March 18 2020, between 38 and 40 people would be hospitalized, with 5 patients in ICU. At that time, the data available indicated at least 18 ICU patients (of which 11 were a cluster at a single hospital) and at least 19 non-critical hospitalized patients. We regarded this agreement as satisfactory within the uncertainties inherent in computer simulation at the population level with such small numbers of cases. Now we need to comment about the R0 parameter used in the simulations. There is no real consensus on the right value for R0 at this stage in the infection, so we experimented to find a value that replicated the observed doubling time of about 2.1-2.5 days in Illinois (Figure 1 ). We found that we could match the emergence of the infection in Illinois with an R0 = 4.0 (annual average), latency = 5 days, infectious period = 3 days, seasonal forcing strength 0.2 and seasonal peak in January. This value is within the ranges reported in an extensive epidemiological study [10] .\n.

A better understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is urgently needed. Clinically, it is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease.\n There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for 2019-nCoV, and studies also suggested that high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. Here we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to prioritize diseases\/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to ACE2 expression in the lung. Expression data was based on GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. Notably, MR is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies.\n The most consistent finding was a tentative causal association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest GWAS on type II diabetes (T2DM) to date (N=898,130), we found that T2DM is causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (beta=0.1835, 95% CI 0.0853-0.2817; p=2.49E-4; GSMR method). Significant associations (at nominal level; p<0.05) was also observed across multiple datasets, with different analytic methods, and for both type I and II diabetes. Other diseases\/traits having nominal significant associations with increased ACE2 included inflammatory bowel disease, (ER+) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated ALT, among others. We also uncovered a number of plasma\/serum proteins potentially linked to altered ACE2 expression, and the top enriched pathways included cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, VEGF signaling, JAK-STAT signaling etc. We also explored drugs that target some of the top-ranked proteins in the MR analysis.","text_body":"higher than the binding affinity to the previous SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein 12 . This provides strong evidence that ACE2 is a target of the novel coronavirus.\nA number of studies have looked into the relationship between ACE2 expression level and coronavirus infection. For example, Li et al. overexpressed ACE2 protein in 293T and Vero E6 cell lines. Over-expression of ACE2 lead to more efficient viral replication, but it was blocked by anti-ACE2 antibody in a dose-dependent manner 9 . A further study also confirmed that susceptibility to SAR-CoV correlates with ACE2 expression on cell lines 13 . In a subsequent work, Jia et al. showed that undifferentiated airway epithelial cells that express little ACE2 were poorly infected by SARS-CoV, while well-differential cells expressing higher ACE2 were readily infected 14 . Taking the evidence together, expression level of the ACE2 protein is associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection.\nSince ACE2 has been supported by multiple studies as a receptor for 2019-nCov, it is reasonable to speculate that higher ACE2 expression in relevant tissues (e.g. the lung) may lead to increased susceptibility to infection. As discussed above, studies have indeed supported this hypothesis for SARS-CoV. While further studies are required, revealing diseases\/traits that are causally associated with altered ACE2 expression may shed light on why certain subjects are more susceptible to the infection and the underlying mechanisms (whether the increased susceptibility is mediated via ACE2).\nIn a related work, recently Cai 15 performed an analysis with TCGA datasets and showed that smoking is associated with elevated expression of ACE2 in the lung, which may be associated with greater susceptibility to infection or more severe illness. However, there are several limitations as detailed by the author. For example, the samples studied are derived from patients with lung cancer, which may not be fully reflective of the expression in normal lung tissues. Another potential limitation is that it is difficult to control for all confounders, as smoking may be related to other unhealthy life habits 16 and multiple comorbid diseases 17, 18 .\nHere we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to explore diseases or traits that may be causally linked to increased ACE2 expression in the lung. We will employ MR for causal inference. MR makes use of genetic variants as \"instruments\" to represent the exposure of interest, and infers causal relationship between the exposure and the outcome 19 . MR is much less susceptible to confounding bias and reverse causality when compared to observational studies.\nThe concept of MR is akin to randomized controlled trials (RCT). For example, consider a study on the causal effect of lipid on the risk of a certain disease. Subjects who have inherited lipid-lowering alleles at a locus (or a set of such alleles at multiple loci) will have lower lipid levels on average, which is analogous to receiving lipid-lowering drugs in an RCT 20 . The random allocation of alleles at conception is similar to random assignment of treatment in an RCT. As a result, the chance of spurious associations due to known or unknown confounders is reduced due to the 'random assignment' of treatment or risk factor. Another important point to .

Since COVID-19 is a new disease and prior knowledge is lacking, we employed a phenome-wide approach in which a large variety of traits are studied for causal associations with ACE2 expression. This analysis may help to prioritize resources for better prevention of the infection in those susceptible subjects.\nIn addition to diseases, we also studied serum\/plasma proteins as exposure, as they may point to potential molecular mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression, and may serve as potential predictive or prognostic biomarkers. It has also been suggested that such proteome-wide studies may help to reveal drug repositioning candidates 21 , through the search for drugs that target the top-ranked proteins. For example, if a protein is found to casually increase the risk of a disease by MR, by the definition of causality, blocking the protein will lead to reduced disease risks. In our study, by finding plasma\/serum proteins causally linked to ACE2 expression, we may find drugs that will alter ACE2 expression, which in turn may be useful for treatment.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-08","authors_x":"Shitao Rao; Alexandria Lau; Hon-Cheong So","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.04.20031237","H index_x":null,"section":"","total_rank":0.0776255708,"risk_factors":["smoking"],"match_indices":[1637,2101],"smoking_count":2,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["statist"],["analysi","analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["randomized controlled"],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk","risk","risk"],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age"],[],[],["health"],[],[],[],[],[],["factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"b696d208705fcb1925693c5f0d118733bb557ea6","title_x":"Exploring diseases\/traits and blood proteins causally related to expression of ACE2, the putative receptor of 2019-nCov: A Mendelian Randomization analysis","abstract_x":"The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has caused major outbreaks in many parts of the world. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is urgently needed. Clinically, it is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease.\n There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for 2019-nCoV, and studies also suggested that high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. Here we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to prioritize diseases\/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to ACE2 expression in the lung. Expression data was based on GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. Notably, MR is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies.\n The most consistent finding was a tentative causal association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest GWAS on type II diabetes (T2DM) to date (N=898,130), we found that T2DM is causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (beta=0.1835, 95% CI 0.0853-0.2817; p=2.49E-4; GSMR method). Significant associations (at nominal level; p<0.05) was also observed across multiple datasets, with different analytic methods, and for both type I and II diabetes. Other diseases\/traits having nominal significant associations with increased ACE2 included inflammatory bowel disease, (ER+) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated ALT, among others. We also uncovered a number of plasma\/serum proteins potentially linked to altered ACE2 expression, and the top enriched pathways included cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, VEGF signaling, JAK-STAT signaling etc. We also explored drugs that target some of the top-ranked proteins in the MR analysis.","text_body":"Remarkably, a number of top-ranked results were related to diabetes. We observed totally five diabetes-related traits that showed nominally significant MR results, and they were all positively associated with ACE2 expression. Three are related to diagnosis of diabetes (including both type I and II) in the UKBB.\nAnother one (id: ieu-a-23) was based on a trans-ethnic meta-analysis in 2014 31 , which had no overlap with the UKBB sample. The finding of a nominally significant result in this dataset can therefore be considered as an independent replication of the UKBB result.\nWe also observed that starting insulin within one year of diagnosis, which was only assessed within diabetic subjects, was casually associated with increased ACE2 expression. Early use of insulin may indicate type I diabetes as the underlying diagnosis or more severe or late-stage disease for type II diabetic subjects 32 .\nIn view of the consistent causal associations with diabetes or related traits, we further searched for GWAS summary statistics that have not been included in the IEU GWAS database. We found another publicly available dataset from the DIAGRAM Consortium, based on a recent meta-analysis of type II diabetes by Mahajan et al. 33 .\nFor a more in-depth analysis, we also employed GSMR and MR-RAPS in addition to IVW and Egger.

GSMR reported the lowest p-value of 2.49E-04 (beta = 0.1835, 95% CI: 0.0853 to 0.2817). While this study 33 has partial overlap with the trans-ethnic analysis in 2014 31 , the consistent associations provide further support to a causal link between diabetes and expression of ACE2.\nRegarding the effect size of casual associations, since the exposures were binary, the regression coefficients (beta) from MR may be roughly interpreted as average change in the outcome (increase in normalized expression level) per 2.72-fold increase in the prevalence of the exposure 34 . For type II diabetes, or self-reported diabetes from UKBB which presumably comprised mainly type II diabetes, the causal estimates ranged from ~0.1621 to 0.1835. These estimates were reasonably close despite different datasets being used.\nThe causal estimate from type I diabetes was slightly lower and estimated to be ~0.1006.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-08","authors_x":"Shitao Rao; Alexandria Lau; Hon-Cheong So","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.04.20031237","H index_x":null,"section":"Diabetes-related traits","total_rank":0.1624472574,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[59,94,260,794,954,1200,2064,2399,2426,2487,2658],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":11,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["statist"],["analysi","analysi","analysi","analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["meta-analysis","meta-analysis"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],["range"],[],[],[],[],[],["age","age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"7326e5ee9bba1b74f32284948fac870c62f56969","title_x":"Relationship between the ABO Blood Group and the COVID-19 Susceptibility","abstract_x":"The novel coronavirus disease-2019 has been spreading around the world rapidly and declared as a pandemic by WHO.

While blood types are genetically inherited, the environment factors can potentially influence which blood types in a population will be passed on more frequently to the next generation. Susceptibility of viral infection has been previously found to be related to ABO blood group. For example, Norwalk virus and Hepatitis B have clear blood group susceptibility 2,3 .

Age was the most important variable in predicting mortality followed by the time gap between symptom onset and hospitalization.\n Conclusions: Patients aged beyond 62 years are at higher risk of fatality whereas hospitalization within 2 days of the onset of symptoms could reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients.","text_body":"Random Forest classification algorithm (4) was implemented over a dataset with 37 deaths and 78 recoveries using the randomForest package in R. The dataset was randomly split into training and test dataset containing 70% and 30% of the total samples respectively. To evaluate the model performance, the Area under the ROC curve was calculated on the test dataset. A variable importance plot was generated using the importance of the predictors over the outcome. The importance of the variables has been reported according to both the mean decrease of Gini and the mean decrease of Accuracy. The partial dependency plots were finally generated using the pdp package in R to determine the marginal effect of the Age and Time to Hospitalization over the fate of COVID-19 infection.\nThe descriptive summary of the data has been represented by mean and standard deviation (SD). The numerical variables have been compared between groups by independentsamples two-sided Student's t-test. The categorical variables have been tested using Chi-square test.

The AUROC on the test dataset was found to be 0.97. Age was the most important variable in the model for predicting the fate which was interestingly followed by the time gap between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization. The importance of the variables in terms of Mean Decrease in Accuracy and Mean Decrease in Gini are graphically shown in Figure 2 (A, B) .\nIn order to inspect the marginal effect of the predictors over the mortality of patients with COVID-19, we generated the partial dependency plots for the odds of Death among COVID-19 patients with Age and Days from the onset of symptoms to hospitalisation. As shown in Figure 2 (C, D), accentuation in odds of death was found with age beyond 62 years as well as beyond a time gap of 2 days between the onset of symptoms to hospitalisation. Taken together, our analysis identifies older age (\uf03e62 years) and delayed hospitalisation as the two most important predictors of mortality among patients with COVID-19.\nMortality of critically ill patients of COVID-19 is high and co-morbidities including hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery disease are often present in hospitalised patients.\nThough 48% of the non-survivors had a co-morbid disease, in multivariate analyses, independent associations of in-hospital death were found to be present with older age, high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and elevated d-dimer levels (6) . Another study has also identified older patients as a high risk group for mortality (7) . In agreement with previously published studies, our analysis also identified Age to be the most important risk factor for mortality among COVID-19 patients. However, the role of delayed hospitalisation following the development of symptoms as another significant risk factor for mortality among COVID-19 patients (after Age) is being reported for the first time. The inadequacy of healthcare resources has already been reported to associate with increased mortality among COVID-19 patients (8) .\nAll rights reserved.

We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the CFR by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age-and location-based underascertainment. We additionally estimated the CFR from individual line-list data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from China, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation.\n We estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 16.9-19.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1-24.4 days). We estimate a crude CFR of 3.67% (95% crI 3.56%-3.80%) in cases from mainland China. Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in Wuhan relative to the rest of China, we obtain a best estimate of the CFR in China of 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%-1.53%) with substantially higher values in older ages. Our estimate of the CFR from international cases stratified by age (under 60 \/ 60 and above) are consistent with these estimates from China. We obtain an overall IFR estimate for China of 0.66% (0.39%-1.33%), again with an increasing profile with age.\n Interpretation: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and demonstrate a strong age-gradient in risk.","text_body":"As of 3rd March 2020, 90,870 cases and 3,112 deaths of the disease COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus had been reported worldwide 1 . To date, the majority of these (80,422 cases and 2,946 deaths) have been reported from mainland China with a geographic focus in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province. However, in recent days the rate of increase in cases has been greatest outside China. At present, substantial outbreaks are occurring in the Republic of Korea (4,812 cases), Iran (1,501 cases) and Italy (2,036 cases). However, geographic expansion of the epidemic continues, with cases now reported from all continents 1 .\nClinical studies conducted on hospitalised cases show that the onset of COVID-19 is associated with symptoms commonly associated with viral pneumonia, most commonly fever, cough\/sore throat and myalgia\/fatigue 2-6 . The case definition adopted in China and elsewhere includes further stratification of cases as severe (defined as tachypnoea (\u226730 breaths\/ min) or oxygen saturation \u226493% at rest, or PaO2\/FIO2 <300 mmHg) and critical (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, septic shock or other organ dysfunction\/failure that requires intensive care) 7 . According to the WHO\/China Joint Mission Report, 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases in China up to 20 February 2020 have mild-tomoderate disease -including both non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases; whilst 13.8% developed severe disease and 6.1% developed to a critical stage requiring intensive care 8 . In a study of clinical progression in 1,099 patients 4 , those at highest risk for severe disease and death included people over the age of 60 years and those with underlying conditions (including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer).\nAssessing the severity of COVID-19 is critical to determine both the appropriateness of mitigation strategies and to enable planning for healthcare needs as epidemics unfold. However, crude case fatality ratios (CFRs) obtained from dividing deaths by cases can be misleading 9,10 . Firstly, there can be a period of two to three weeks between a case developing symptoms, subsequently being detected and reported and observing the final clinical outcome. During a growing epidemic the final clinical outcome of most of the reported cases is typically unknown. Simply dividing the cumulative reported number of deaths by the cumulative number of reported cases will therefore underestimate the true CFR early in an epidemic 9-11 . This effect was observed in past epidemics of respiratory pathogensincluding SARS 12 and H1N1 9 influenza -and as such is widely recognised. Thus, many of the estimates of the CFR that have been obtained to date for COVID-19 correct for this effect [13] [14] [15] [16] . Additionally, however, during the exponentially growing phase of an epidemic, the observed time-lags between the onset of symptoms and outcome (recovery or death) are censored and na\u00efve estimates of the observed times from symptoms onset to outcome provide biased estimates of the actual distributions. Ignoring this effect tends to bias the estimated CFR downwards during the early growth phase of an epidemic.\nSecondly, surveillance of a newly emerged pathogen is typically biased towards detecting clinically severe cases, particularly at the start of an epidemic when diagnostic capacity is limited (Figure 1) . Estimates of the CFR may thus be biased upwards until the extent of clinically milder disease is determined 9 . Data from the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan, China have primarily been detected through hospital surveillance and hence are likely to represent moderate or severe illness, with atypical pneumonia and\/or acute respiratory distress being used to define suspected cases eligible for testing 7 . In these individuals, clinical outcomes are likely to be more severe, and therefore any estimates of the CFR will be higher. Elsewhere in mainland China and outside, countries and administrative regions alert to the risk of infection being imported via travel initially instituted surveillance for COVID-19 with a broader set of clinical criteria for defining a suspected case. These typically include a combination of symptoms (e.g. cough and fever) combined with recent travel history to the affected region (Wuhan and\/or Hubei Province) 2, 17 . Such surveillance is therefore likely to detect clinically milder cases but, by initially restricting testing to those with a travel history or link, may have missed other symptomatic cases. More recently, as epidemics have taken off in other countries, cases are now being detected in those with no reported travel links to Wuhan\/Hubei province through broader surveillance systems. Some of these cases may represent a milder level of severity -including secondary cases identified via contact-tracing or those identified through sentinel surveillance of influenza-like-illness at primary care 18, 19 . In contrast, others will represent the severe end of the disease spectrum with an increasing number identified through hospital surveillance (for example, testing of viral pneumonia) or in a few cases, at post-mortem analysis.\nQuantifying the extent of infection overall in the population (including those infected with either mild, non-specific symptoms or who are asymptomatic, as depicted in the bottom of Figure 1 ) requires random population surveys of infection prevalence. Serological assays provide the best option for obtaining this denominator; however, robust assays are not currently available. The only such data providing an assessment of the level of infection in a subset of the population not presenting with symptoms at present is therefore the PCR infection prevalence surveys conducted in international residents of Wuhan that have been repatriated to their home country.\nHere we attempt to adjust for these biases in data sources to obtain estimates of the CFR (proportion of all cases that will eventually die) and infection fatality ratio (IFR, the proportion of all infections that will eventually die) using both individual-level case report data and aggregate case and death counts from mainland China, administrative regions and international case reports. By adjusting for both underlying demography and potential under-ascertainment at different levels of the severity pyramid (Figure 1 ), these estimates should be broadly applicable across a range of settings to inform health planning whilst more detailed case data accrue.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-13","authors_x":"Robert Verity; Lucy C Okell; Ilaria Dorigatti; Peter Winskill; Charles Whittaker; Natsuko Imai; Gina Cuomo-Dannenburg; Hayley Thompson; Patrick Walker; Han Fu; Amy Dighe; Jamie Griffin; Anne Cori; Marc Baguelin; Sangeeta Bhatia; Adhiratha Boonyasiri; Zulma M Cucunuba; Rich Fitzjohn; Katy A M Gaythorpe; Will Green; Arran Hamlet; Wes Hinsley; Daniel Laydon; Gemma Nedjati-Gilani; Steven Riley; Sabine van-Elsand; Erik Volz; Haowei Wang; Yuanrong Wang; Xiayoue Xi; Christl Donnelly; Azra Ghani; Neil Ferguson","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.09.20033357","H index_x":null,"section":"Introduction","total_rank":0.0603603604,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[1707],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak","outbreak"],[],[],["analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],["prevalence survey"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk"],["range"],[],["asymptomatic"],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age"],[],[],["health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"4d60493c2a4c1369445f11035a9f69f10a197468","title_x":"Predicting Mortality Risk in Patients with COVID-19 Using Artificial Intelligence to Help Medical Decision-Making","abstract_x":"In the wake of COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we designed and developed a predictive model based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning algorithms to determine the health risk and predict the mortality risk of patients with COVID-19.

We consulted with a medical team to make sure that the best features are extracted and selected. The next step is feature selection. The primary purpose of feature selection is to find the most informative features and eliminate redundant data to reduce the dimensionality and complexity of the model [11] . We used univariate and multivariate filter method and wrapper method to rank the features and select the best feature subset [11] . Figure 2 demonstrates the steps of filter and wrapper method that we used for feature selection. Filter methods are very popular (especially for large datasets) since they are usually very fast and much less computationally intensive than wrapper methods. Filter methods use a specific metric to score each individual feature (or a subset of features together). The most popular metrics used in filter methods include correlation coefficient, Fisher score, mutual information, entropy and consistency and chisquare parameters [11] .\nAfter applying different filter and wrapper methods, we chose 42 features out of 112 features.

Our results suggest that the disease spread in a city in China is characterized by two-stages process.

These two stages can explain the significant differences between the propagation in China and in other world-wide locations. While most Chinese cities control the disease which resulted in the decaying stage, in other world-wide countries the situation is still becoming worse probably due to less control.\n All rights reserved.

A medical cure from the disease is yet unavailable and the number of infected cases is still increasing (Fig. 1a) . In China, the number of infected individuals exceeds 80000 as for 18 of March 2020 and the virus has already spread to more than 100 countries around the world. Furthermore, the virus shows a mortality rate of 2.5% of all infected persons [1] (4% as for 18 of March 2020), compared to 9.6% in SARS [2] or 0.6% for the H1N1 influenza [3] . This high mortality rate together with the lack of a cure for the COVID-19 virus, are the reasons for the severe restrictions on those that were in contact with COVID-19 confirmed cases, which mainly includes strict quarantine of 14 days. The high mortality rates of COVID-19 are not uniformly distributed through different ages. Rather the mortality rate is as high as 5%-11% for ages over 70 with an increased risk for patients with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases or cancer [4] .\nIn the absence of both medicine and vaccination, strategies of effective distributing of them are not considered yet [5] and the options to stop the propagation of the disease are currently to quarantines the infected individuals [6] and social distancing [7] in order to cut the infection channels. Statistical estimations of the incubating (latency) period of the virus which includes no signs of illness vary between different populations and found to be of about 4-6 days [8] while a long incubation period of 19 days has also been observed [9] . The 14 days quarantine period, which has been adopted by many countries, is a result of the higher limit of the 95% confidence levels [10] of this incubating period. Under this quarantine strategy, the virus spreading could be alleviated.\nThe COVID-19 propagation is in a different stage in China compared to other locations in the world. Although China is the country with most infection cases (as for 18 of March 2020), the disease stopped to spread while in other countries the disease keeps propagating close to exponentially as can be seen in Figs. 1b and 1c. In fact, in most of the cities in China spreading stopped approximately after 20 days as shown in Fig. 1c , in contrast, in other location it is spreading as shown for Italy in Fig. 1d . This suggests that one can learn from the disease decay in China and apply similar measures in other locations in the world. While a general estimation of the disease evolution has been recently conducted [11, 12] , a comprehensive analysis of its spatio-temporal propagation which is important for epidemic forecast, is still missing. In this manuscript, we study the spatiotemporal propagation of the COVID-19 virus and discuss the differences between China and other countries.\nWe study the spatial dynamics of the COVID-19 originated in Hubei and find scaling (power) laws for the number of infected individuals in each province as a function of the province population and the distance from Hubei. Furthermore, we find strong correlation between the number of infected individuals in each province and the population migration from Hubei to this province. This correlation suggests that the disease propagation is due to human mobility [13, 14] which has been suggested to follow a L\u00e9vy-flight pattern [15] [16] [17] . A reasonable explanation for this correlation can be the strict quarantines applied in most of the cities in China after the shutdown of Wuhan traffic [18, 19] . These quarantines were effective and probably prevented infected individuals to further spread the disease to other cities. Hence, the number of infected individuals is highly correlated to the population migration from Hubei before the shutdown, Fig. 2 .\nSince quarantine is usually applied on a city level, more insight can be obtained in analyzing the epidemic in cities. Indeed, our results suggest that many cities in China experience a two-stages process of the disease. At early times (of order of few days), the disease was undetectable due to the incubating period and the disease was spreading within the city. At later times, the infected individuals have been quarantined and the disease started to decay approximately exponentially in many cities. The quarantines have been effective to extinct the disease inside a city and reach a stable state with close to zero infection rate. Since quarantines were applied almost at the same time in most of the cities in China, we find that the decay stage of the disease starts almost at the same time for most of the cities no matter if they are large central cities, small cities or even Hubei province cities. For the same reason most of the cities experience a similar 10-20 days characteristic time of the disease drastic reduction. Note that usually quarantines are applied on a city scale, thus, studying the disease decay on a country scale might lead to uncertain conclusion regarding the disease situation since the disease may propagate in one city and decay in another.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-27","authors_x":"Bnaya Gross; Zhiguo Zheng; Shiyan Liu; Xiaoqi Chen; Alon Sela; Jianxin Li; Daqing Li; Shlomo Havlin","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20041517","H index_x":null,"section":"I.

Objective: Evaluate the risk of pre-existing comorbidities on COVID-19 mortality, and provide clinical suggestions accordingly. Method: This study used a nested case-control design. A total of 94 publicly reported deaths in locations outside of Hubei Province, China, between December 18 th , 2019 and March 8 th , 2020\n were included as cases. Each case was matched with up to three controls, based on gender and age \u00b1 1 year old (94 cases and 181 controls). The inverse probability weighted Cox proportional hazard model was performed.\n Results: History of comorbidities significantly increased the death risk of COVID-19: one additional pre-existing comorbidity led to an estimated 40% higher risk of death (p<0.001). The estimated mortality risk in patients with CHD was three times of those without CHD (p<0.001).\n The estimated 30-day survival probability for a profile patient with pre-existing CHD (65-yearold female with no other comorbidities) was 0.53 (95% CI [0.34-0.82]), while it was 0.85 (95% CI [0.79-0.91]) for those without CHD. Older age was also associated with increased death risk: every 5-year increase in age was associated with a 20% increased risk of mortality (p<0.001).\n Conclusion: Extra care and early medical intervention are needed for patients with pre-existing comorbidities, especially CHD.

Final follow-up for this report lasted until 16 February 2020.\nThe primary method of diagnosis is to perform real-time reversetranscriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay test using throat swab specimens that were collected from upper respiratory tracts. This test is done twice at 24-hour interval. Of the 91 cases reported in here, 88 cases were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least once. These laboratory confirmation assays for SARS-CoV-2 were performed at CDCs of various cities and at Ningbo First Hospital following the standard protocol. 8 Three further cases were reported in Ningbo cohort as clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia because of their epidemiological history, signs, symptoms and chest CT evidence according to National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China guidance, though they tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2. 13,14 The incubation period was defined as the time from the exposure to the confirmed or suspected transmission source to the onset of illness.\nA team of doctors who had been treating these patients extracted the medical records of these patients and sent the data to working group in Ningbo to further examine.

The basis of this concern involves whether ACEIs\/ARBs increase expression of ACE2, the primary cellular receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thereby may increase severity of the infection. Here, we review key literature regarding this possibility by assessing studies conducted in experimental animals (primarily rats) and humans. We focus our discussion on studies for which ACE2 protein data are available, as tissue ACE2 mRNA expression appears to only weakly correlate with protein expression, as shown from data in the Human Protein Atlas 6 (proteinatlas.org), results from human renal samples 7 and animal studies discussed below (e.g. 8, 9 ) . We focused our assessment on studies that evaluated ACE2 levels in tissues\/cells involved in infection by SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2. Data from 12 animal studies are summarized in Table 1 , which shows the effect of ACEI\/ARB use on ACE2 protein expression\/activity in animals (primarily in rats). We used conversion factors based on the principles of allometric scaling to evaluate doses in animals relative to their use in humans 10 . For studies in which this was relevant, we used the HED (Human Equivalent Dose, assuming a 60 kg human 10 ) for doses of ACEI\/ARBs. We obtained recommended doses for humans using approved labelling from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (fda.gov). These recommended human doses are provided in Table 2 . For most of the drugs, the maximum doses indicated in Table 2 are seldom achieved in humans, such that treatment of animals with equivalent (or larger) doses, (especially in models of acute dosing, as in refs 15 and 19 discussed in Table 1 ) raise concern about their relevance to ACEI\/ARB administration to patients, including in the setting of COVID-19.\nIn summary, 3 studies 8, 11, 19 in animals reported an increase in all treatment groups, of ACE2 protein expression\/activity with ACEI\/ARB treatment but in one such study, 8 combined ARB\/ACEI treatment did not show this effect. The other two studies reported relatively small effects (< 40% increase in ACE2 protein expression in control\/sham animals). All of these studies used high doses of ACEIs\/ARBs, as noted above. By contrast, 6 studies 9, 12, 14, 16, 17, 20 found little or no change in ACE2 expression with ACEI\/ARB treatment. In 3 studies 13, 15, 19 , treatment with ACEI\/ARB had no effect or a decrease in ACE2 protein expression\/activity in control\/sham animals; increased ACE2 expression was only observed following experimental exposure, such as lung injury, MI, etc. In nearly all studies that reported an increase in ACE2, doses of ACEIs\/ARBs used were greater than equivalent doses typically administered to patients. We identified only one study 13 in which ACEI\/ARB use increased ACE2 protein expression at doses typical of human use, albeit these changes only occurred after exposure to acute injury (subtotal nephrectomy). Overall, the studies with experimental animals do not provide consistent evidence for an effect of ARB\/ACEI administration on ACE2 protein expression, especially in contexts that model drug administration in humans.\nEvidence of changes in ACE2 protein in human subjects\/patients ( Table 3 ) are derived from studies that assessed ACE2 protein concentration or enzymatic activity in urine or serum\/plasma. Of the 10 studies summarized in Table 3 , 7 showed no effect of ARB\/ACEI use on ACE2 protein levels. One study 26 documented a small increase in serum ACE2 attributable to use of ACEIs among Type-1 diabetic patients but found no effect from use of ARBs. Another study 23 found a slightly larger proportional decrease in urinary ACE2 in patients with Type-2 diabetes using ACEIs\/ARBs, but did not distinguish between effects from use of ACEIs or ARBs. In one study 22 the investigators observed that subjects using the ARB Olmesartan had increased ACE2 levels, but several other ARBs and ACEIs had no effect. Besides these quantitative data, other results regarding ACE2 protein expression, generated from immunohistochemical analysis in kidneys 31 , indicated no ACEI-dependent effect. Together, these results imply a lack of association between ACE2 protein expression and the use of ARBs or ACEIs and support the idea that ACEIs\/ARBs are unlikely to raise ACE2 and be harmful in the context of COVID-19 infection.\nWhat would constitute strong, supportive evidence for the hypothesis that ACEI\/ARB usage is a risk factor in the setting of SARS-CoV2 infection? Findings to help support that hypothesis would include: 1) Replication of a prominent effect in multiple animal studies and models; 2) Evidence that tissues with low expression of ACE2 have prominent increases in its expression and activity following ACEI\/ARB treatment; 3) Data documenting that increases in ACE2 expression in response to ACEI\/ARB treatment enhance the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to infect cells; 4) Findings from human studies of statistically significant relationships between ACEI\/ARB usage and ACE2 expression\/activity; 5) Epidemiological data showing that COVID-19 patients administered ACEIs\/ARBs have increased morbidity and mortality, ideally with a dose-response relationship for such outcomes.\nHow well do the available data provide such evidence? 1) The hypothesis that ACE2 expression increases with ACEI\/ARB use is not supported by the plurality of available data from animal studies. 2) There is no available evidence for de novo expression of ACE2 expression in response to ACEIs\/ARBs in tissues with low expression. 3) The affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for ACE2 is very high, ~4-fold greater than SARS-CoV-1 32 . It is unclear if small or modest perturbations in ACE2 expression impact the infectivity of SARS-COV-2. Moreover, ACE2 levels may decrease with age 33,34 and diabetes 35 , yet elderly\/diabetic subjects are more vulnerable than younger individuals to COVID-19 36 . Modest changes in ACE2 expression may not meaningfully impact on the high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in host tissues. 4) Data from human studies suggest that treatment with ACEIs\/ARBs produces little or no effect on urinary or circulating ACE2 levels. As a caveat, changes in ACE2 levels in serum or urine may not reflect changes in tissue. 5) Epidemiological studies have not assessed outcomes in matched groups of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, who have or have not been taking ACEIs\/ARBs. Based on the data summarized above, we conclude that current evidence, especially from human studies ( Table  3) , does not support the idea that treatment with ACEIs or ARBS produces pathophysiologically relevant increases in ACE2 protein abundance. The hypothesis that the use of these drugs increases SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivity and\/or severity of COVID-19 is therefore not supported by the available evidence. It would thus seem prudent for patients to continue receiving these medications, as recently recommended by multiple health associations 2 .\n(1091 words without\/ 1295 including the abstract)\n.

Sports and entertainment events were canceled (VEC) in Japan for two weeks during 26 February -13 March. Most schools were closed (SC).\n Object: We construct a susceptible-infected-recovered model using three age classes and estimate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) and protection level among children simultaneously. Then we simulate SC and VEC effects.\n Method: We used data of patients with symptoms in Japan during 14 January to assess SC and VEC introduction. Effects of SC and VEC were incorporated into the model through change in the contact pattern or frequencies among age classes.\n : Results suggest R 0 as 2.86 [95%CI of 2.73, 2.97]. The protection level was estimated as 0.4 [0.2, 0.7]. SC and VEC can reduce the total number of patients significantly, by 6-7%.\n Discussion and Conclusion: The estimated R 0 was similar to that found from other studies in China and Japan. We found a significant protection level among children, and by effects of SC and VEC. Introduction All rights reserved.

Therefore, published data of patients must be adjusted at least a few days. To adjust the data, we applied the following regression. We denote Xt-k|t as the number of patients for whom the onset date was t-k published on day t. The dependent variables are the degree of reporting delay,\n where k>m in several m and k. Here, m denotes the difference of the publishing dates between the two published. Date t represents the publishing date of the latest publishing.\n The explanatory variables were 1\/k, 1\/m, and 1\/km. The degree of reporting delay was estimated as [estimated coefficient of constant term] + [estimated coefficient of 1\/k]\/k, when m was sufficiently large and time had passed. Therefore, this estimated degree of reporting delay multiplied by the latest published data is expected to be a prediction of the number of patients for whom the onset date was t-k. We used this adjusted number of patients in the latest few days including those after VEC was adopted. We used published data of 2, 5, 6 and 9-17 March, 2020 provided by MLHW [1].\n First, we estimated the joint distribution of R 0 and the protection rate in children in All rights reserved.

As of 18 March, 2020, 690 cases were announced as infected in the community, including asymptomatic cases, but excluding those abroad in countries such as China or those infected on a large cruise ship: the Diamond Princess [1] .\nEarlier research suggested that children might be less susceptible to COVID-19 for lifestyle-related factors such as lack of smoking and less vigorous immune response than that of adults [2] . Children might have some cross protection from non-novel coronavirus infection. Even though the reasons for it had not become clear, the number of children among patients was quite small. In fact, even in Japan, the incidence rate including asymptomatic cases among children was 0.79 per million population compared to 5.97 for adults and 7.82 for elderly people as of 17 March. Incidence among children was approximately one-tenth that of elderly people. Therefore, this clear phenomenon must be incorporated into the model when predicting the outbreak.\nOn that point, we produce a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model with three age classes and search for a protection rate in children as well as the basic production number, R 0 .\nIn Japan, school closure (SC) and voluntary event cancellation (VEC) were All rights reserved.

Till date, well tested medication or antidote is not available to cure this disease. According to WHO reports, COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome which is transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Analysis of this disease requires major attention by the Government to take necessary steps in reducing the effect of this global pandemic. In this study, outbreak of this disease has been analysed for India till 30 th March 2020 and predictions have been made for the number of cases for the next 2 weeks. SEIR model and Regression model have been used for predictions based on the data collected from John Hopkins University repository in the time period of 30 th January 2020 to 30 th March 2020. The performance of the models was evaluated using RMSLE and achieved 1.52 for SEIR model and 1.75 for the regression model. The RMSLE error rate between SEIR model and Regression model was found to be 2.01. Also, the value of R 0 which is the spread of the disease was calculated to be 2.02. Expected cases may rise between 5000-6000 in the next two weeks of time. This study will help the Government and doctors in preparing their plans for the next two weeks. Based on the predictions for short-term interval, these models can be tuned for forecasting in long-term intervals.","text_body":"The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is a major global health threat. The Novel COVID-19 has been reported as the most detrimental respiratory virus since 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 situation report [1] as on March 27, 2020, a total of 509,164 confirmed cases and 23,335 deaths have been reported across the world. Global spread has been rapid, with 170 countries now having reported at least one case. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Corona virus belongs to a family of viruses which is responsible for illness ranging from common cold to deadly diseases as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which were first discovered in China [2002] and Saudi Arabia [2012] . The 2019-novel Coronavirus or better known as COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China for the very first time on 31st December 2019. According to Jiang et al. [3] the fatality rate for this virus has been estimated to be 4.5% but for the age group 70-79 this has gone up to 8.0% while for those >80 it has been noted to be 14.8%. This has led to elderly persons above the age of 50 with underlying diseases like diabetes, Parkinson's disease and cardiovascular disease to be considered at the highest risk. Symptoms for this disease can take 2-14 days to appear and can range from fever, cough, shortness of breath to pneumonia, kidney failure and even death [1] . The transmission is person to person via respiratory droplets among close contact with the average number of people infected by a patient being 1.5 -3.5 but the virus is not considered airborne [2] . There exist a large number of evidences where machine learning algorithms have proven to give efficient predictions in healthcare [4] [5] [6] . Nsoesie et al. [7] has provided a systematic review of approaches used to forecast the dynamics of influenza pandemic. They have reviewed research papers based on deterministic mass action models, regression models, prediction rules, Bayesian network, SEIR model, ARIMA forecasting model etc. Recent studies on COVID-19 include only exploratory analysis of the available limited data [8] [9] [10] . Effective and well-tested vaccine against CoVID-19 has not been invented and hence a key part in managing this pandemic is to decrease the epidemic peak, also known as flattening the epidemic curve. The role of data scientists and data mining researchers is to integrate the related data and technology to better understand the virus and its characteristics, which can help in taking right decisions and concrete plan of actions. It will lead to a bigger picture in taking aggressive measures in developing infrastructure, facilities, vaccines and restraining similar epidemics in future. The objectives of the current study are as follows.\n1. Finding the rate of spread of the disease in India. 2. Developing a mathematical SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to evaluate the spread of disease. 3. Prediction of COVID-19 outbreak using SEIR and Regression models. After presenting background in Section I, Section II presents the methodology about the model used in this study. Section III covers analysis, experimental results and performance evaluation. Discussion has been provided in section IV followed by conclusion in section V.","publish_time_x":"2020-04-03","authors_x":"Rajan Gupta; Gaurav Pandey; Poonam Chaudhary; Saibal Kumar Pal","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20049825","H index_x":null,"section":"Introduction","total_rank":0.105015674,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[1284],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[["mathemat"],[],[],[],["contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["model","model","model","model","model","model","model"],["outbreak"],[],[],["analysi","analysi"],["experiment"],[],[],[],[],[],["systematic review "],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk"],["range"],[],[],["infecti","Infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age"],[],[],["health","Health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"b7df981c6a0794ec50c0c2896df2e492f0868fe7","title_x":"Acute kidney injury at early stage as a negative prognostic indicator of patients with COVID-19: a hospital-based retrospective analysis","abstract_x":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been pandemic all over the world.

On February12, 2020, the International Committee on SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted by droplets or direct contact and infected through respiratory tract 2 . In addition, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted by feces 3 . Accumulating data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells, mainly pulmonary epithelial cells, and probably cardiomyocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells [4] [5] [6] . The main symptoms and signs of COVID-19 patients are fever, companied by dry cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, fatigue and lymphopenia [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Although only a few cases died in mild COVID-19 patients, death risk was rapidly increased among critical ill patients with the fatality rate even more than 50% 12 . A large number of clinical data have revealed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 not only causes severe acute respiratory syndrome but also multiple organ injuries, including myocardial dysfunction, hepatic injury and even acute renal failure (AKI) 13 . Nevertheless, what factors influence the multiple organ injuries, especially AKI, during the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remains unclear. Moreover, the clinical significance of AKI needs to be further clarified.\nThe objective of this study is to describe the clinical and laboratory features of AKI at early stage of 355 COVID-19 patients in two hospitals from different regions.\nWe showed that male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus were more susceptible to AKI.

Several reports showed that most COVID-19 patients were companied with multiple organ damage 9, 14 . However, the present study found that there was no significant association between oxygenation index and all measured renal functional indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-induced AKI is independent of respiratory failure. Two early reports showed that ACE2, as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was highly expressed in renal tubular epithelium 18, 19 .\nAnother early study found that SARS viral particles were detected in the epithelium of the renal distal tubules 20 . Therefore, the present study does not exclude that SARS-CoV-2 induces AKI through directly infecting renal epithelium. Further experiments are required to explore whether renal tubular epithelium is another target of SARS-CoV-2 injection.\nIn summary, the present study described the clinical and laboratory characteristics of AKI among 355 COVID-19 patients in two hospitals from different regions.

The outbreak of the virus along the time has become a massive threat to the global public health security and has been declared as a pandemic. Accounting the radical number of increases in the infected cases and the death due to COVID-19 infections around the globe, there is a need to predict the infections among the people by making proper optimization and using various Infectious Disease modelling (IDM) methods, in order to challenge the outcome. In comparison with previous diseases like SARS and Ebola viruses, the new corona virus infections are infectious during the incubation period. In addition to that, naturally produced droplets from humans (e.g. droplets produced by breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing) and Person-to-person contact transmission are reported to be the foremost ways of transmission of novel corona virus.\n By considering the above two factors, a modified SEIR (Susceptibility-Exposure-Infection-Recovery) method have been used for predicting the spread of the infections in the state of Tamil Nadu which is located in the southern part of India. Further, we have utilized the current surveillance data from Health and Family Welfare Department -Government of Tamil Nadu to accurately predict the spreading trend of the infection on a state level.","text_body":"There are extensive and eminent histories of mathematical models in epidemiology.

In this model the population is divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics (Sarah A, 2012) .\nAs a significant element, SEIR model is presented in this paper, where there is an exposed duration between being infected and becoming infective (Incubation period). Various researches have been conducted on SEIR models which are presented in detail in (Sun, C., Hsieh, Y., 2010; Yi, N., Zhang, Q., Mao, K., Yang, D., Li, Q., 2009; Zhang, J., Li., Ma, Z., 2006; Zhou, X., Cui, J., 2011) . Treating such deadly disease such as SARS, measles, flue and tuberculosis this model played a significant role in controlling or decreasing the spread of the infections in the specified study region. More recent work on the effect of treatment on the dynamic behavior can be found in (Tang, Zhou., Li, Xianbin., Li, Houqiang., 2020; Wang, J., Liu, S., Zheng, B., Takeuchi, Y., 2012; Wendi, 2006) . Contrastingly, in traditional epidemic models, the treatment rate is presumed to be proportionate to the number of infective, which is almost not possible in reality. Therefore, in this paper assuming that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness, will not be suitable for the current situation as the COVID-19 is infectious even during its incubation period.

In a study of 1099 patients across mainland China, 38.7% of patients with comorbidities progressed to severe infection [3] . 2020), and in a study of 52 inpatients in Wuhan, 67% of patients with comorbidities died [2] . The most common comorbidities reported in these studies were hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, and coronary heart disease [1] [2] [3] . Other comorbidities such as carcinoma, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, digestive system disease, and nervous system disease have also been reported in patients with COVID-19 [1, 2, 4] . A better understanding of the link between these conditions and COVID-19 infection is required to inform better treatment and prevention interventions.\nThe molecular mechanism responsible for the increased disease severity in patients with these comorbidities is not fully understood, but previous studies suggest a role for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [5] . ACE2 is a membrane protein required for SARS-CoV2 to bind and enter cells [6] [7] [8] . After binding, viral entry is facilitated by the activation of the viral spike glycoprotein and cleavage of the C-terminal segment of ACE2 by proteases like TMPRSS2 and FURIN that are readily expressed in lung tissue [9] [10] [11] . ACE2 is only moderately expressed in healthy lung tissue compared to the heart, kidneys, and testes [12] , but staining of lung tissue sections from adults with pulmonary hypertension has revealed increased ACE2 protein in the endothelium of pulmonary arteries, compared to healthy controls [13] . ACE2 upregulation has also been observed in animal models of liver fibrosis [14] . However, the reason for this upregulation remains unclear, and a link to other COVID-19 comorbidities has not been determined.\nHere, we showed that ACE2 expression in lung tissue is upregulated by diseases representing comorbidities along with COVID-19. We also used systems biology approaches including co-expression analysis, meta-analysis, and network analysis to determine a potential cause of the ACE2 upregulation.

As we did not find lung transcriptome samples from patients with type 2 diabetes, we could not directly test whether ACE2 expression was increased in patients with diabetes, compared to healthy controls. However, our text-mining approach revealed that IL-6 and INS genes were associated with all the diseases we searched. The INS gene encodes the insulin hormone, and insulin is associated with the NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) [35] . We found that SIRT1 was up-regulated in the lung of patients with severe COVID-19 comorbidities in 4 out 7 studies (data not shown). Clarke et al [36] have demonstrated that, under conditions of cell energy stress, SIRT1 can epigenetically regulate ACE2. Others too have shown that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may inhibit the SIRT1 deacetylase activity [37] , which in turn could impact ACE2 expression.\nThe \"viral life cycle\" pathway that was enriched with up-regulated genes in patients with severe COVID-19 comorbidities contains several genes other than ACE2 that can be potentially important for SARS-CoV-2 cell cycle and invasion\/attachment. These include RAB1A gene, whose product promotes the replication of Vaccinia virus [38] . Also, RAB1A is important for Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Secondary Envelopment [39] , and is required for assembly of classical swine fever virus particle [40] . It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes RAB1A as well.\nThe fact that ACE2 gene is located in the X chromosome, and the initial findings showing that older males with comorbidities are more likely to be have severe COVID-19 compared to females [1] , indicate that ACE2 expression in the lung may be sex-biased.\nAlthough no significant sexual differences was found in the activity of ACE2 in mouse lung [41] , in rats, the levels of ACE2 were dramatically reduced with aging in both genders, but with significantly higher ACE2 expression in old female rats than male [42] .\nAlthough the mechanisms by which ACE2 is up-regulated in patients with severe COVID-19 comorbidities were not addressed, our analysis may shed some light on the subject.\n.

For instance, HAT and HDAC modulate chromatin and DNA condensation by changing histone acetylation status, thus permitting gene transcription. This could be happening in lung tissue, facilitating ACE2 expression, as observed during lung cancer and COPD.\nKDM5B is associated with infection of hepatitis B virus [43] . In breast cancer cells, blockage of KDM5 triggers a robust interferon response that results in resistance to infection by DNA and RNA viruses [44] . This finding suggests that KDM5 demethylases are potential targets for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nCOVID-19 may kill between 5.6% and 15.2% of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 [45] .\nDrug treatments that lower this mortality rate may save many thousands of lives.

Albumin was selected as a marker for the acute phase response instead of C reactive protein (CRP) because of CRP collinearity with LDH. Age is known risk factor for mortality from severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19. Lymphocyte count and platelet counts were reported in a previous publication of COVID-19 and selected 7, 12 . In this study, lymphocyte count was log transformed due to extreme values. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diabetes and hypertension were selected based on previous publications 7 . All nine selected variables were input into the multivariable model and backwards stepwise selection was performed with improvement in goodness-of-fit assessed by a reduction in the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). A nomogram of the selected final model was used for graphical representation of the prediction model and was produced with R function regplotthis was chosen to offer maximum use of the prediction model in clinical practice without the need for internet access 13, 14 .\nModel performance was assessed via measures of discrimination and calibration. To assess discrimination, the C statistic was used. For calibration, patients in the development database were split into deciles, ordered by their probability of death. For each decile, the mean of the predicted probability of death was calculated and compared with the mean observed probability of death. Calibration plots were constructed including locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (loess) regression lines 15 .\nInternal validity was assessed with bootstrapping (1000 replications) of the entire model building process including backwards stepwise selection of all potential predictors. is the author\/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-30","authors_x":"Jianfeng Xie; Daniel Hungerford; Hui Chen; Simon T Abrams; Shusheng Li; Guozheng Wang; Yishan Wang; Hanyujie Kang; Laura Bonnett; Ruiqiang Zheng; Xuyan Li; Zhaohui Tong; Bin Du; Haibo Qiu; Cheng-Hock Toh","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20045997","H index_x":null,"section":"Statistical analysis","total_rank":0.1095008052,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[833,2378],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":2,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["logistic regression"],[],[],[],[],[],[],["model","model","model","model","model","model","model","model","Model","model"],[],[],["statist","statist"],["analysi","Analysi","analysi","analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk"],[],[],[],["infecti"],[],[],["age","Age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"9a0c89a9b8ff3969d97b7cc4245489ff69f3a615","title_x":"Development and external validation of a prognostic multivariable model on admission for hospitalized patients with COVID-19","abstract_x":"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a pressing need for development of a prognostic tool that is easy for clinicians to use.

This is consistent with the current data from China on COVID-19 with less than 1% in children <10 years old, increasing to 2%, 4% and 10% in age 11-40, 41-70, and >70, respectively. However, the majority of people infected are 30-70 years old (approximately 80% of the total cases), thereby making it difficult to stratify the majority of cases according to age. Patient comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, did not significantly contribute to the model, although mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with hypertension.\nThe pathological feature of COVID-19 is mainly that of a viral pneumonia with alveolar oedema and blockage of small bronchi to compromise gas exchange within the lungs.\nTherefore, PaO2 will drop when severe pneumonia develops. Since arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is an invasive and complex process, which requires arterial blood taking and use of a ABG analyzer, SpO2 measurement is much more used for continuous analysis of blood oxygen saturation in patients to estimate the arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) 22 . Moreover, many mobile phone brands contain built-in sensors and SpO2 can be measured by patients themselves.\nIn our cohorts, many patients had no blood gas data and therefore SpO2 was used as a variable in our model. Although SpO2 is not as accurate as PaO2 in critical illnesses, it could give the first indication of compromised lung gas exchange in the early stages of COVID-19, which would then be verified by ABG measurement upon admission to hospital.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-30","authors_x":"Jianfeng Xie; Daniel Hungerford; Hui Chen; Simon T Abrams; Shusheng Li; Guozheng Wang; Yishan Wang; Hanyujie Kang; Laura Bonnett; Ruiqiang Zheng; Xuyan Li; Zhaohui Tong; Bin Du; Haibo Qiu; Cheng-Hock Toh","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20045997","H index_x":null,"section":"(which was not peer-reviewed)","total_rank":0.1970588235,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[750],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["model","model","model"],[],[],[],["analysi","analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"6115e9fbaed5e154ff92cb8d02387fec72251dab","title_x":"Title: Protocol of a randomized controlled trial testing inhaled Nitric Oxide in mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)","abstract_x":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) due to novel Coronavirus","text_body":"Study Setting.

It is worth noting that COVID-19 has a more diverse mode of transmission that can manifest itself as asymptomatic infection [7] , something that has not previously been seen in SARS [47] . Because of the absence of symptoms, it is difficult to detect and isolate carriers in time, which makes it more difficult to control the spread of the disease [47, 48] . Recent studies have found that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the feces of patients, indicating that the possibility of fecal-oral transmission [4, 12] . There have been reports of infections in newborns [2] , but more studies are needed to confirm the presence of vertical transmission. A study of nine pregnant women [2] which tested the amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs and breast milk of six patients for SARS-CoV, all of which were negative and did not support mother-to-child transmission. Human-to-human, asymptomatic infection and possible mother-to-child transmission and fecal-oral transmission are the causes of the widespread spread of the disease. So, the early recognition of COVID-19 in different countries can reduces transmission risk and increases understanding of SARS-CoV-2, to inform national and global response actions.","publish_time_x":"2020-02-25","authors_x":"mao yaqian; Wei Lin; Junping Wen; Gang Chen","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.02.20.20025601","H index_x":null,"section":"Route of transmission","total_rank":0.228668942,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[1127],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":1,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk"],[],[],["asymptomatic","asymptomatic"],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"6fcf4019b0be24071210f97eda4baba53a6a79de","title_x":"Clinical and pathological characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a systematic reviews","abstract_x":"A word count for text :2460 words All rights reserved.

The World Health Organization's (WHO) State Party Self-Assessment Annual Reporting (SPAR) database assigns scores to countries to assess capacities needed to detect, assess, notify, report, and respond to public health risk and acute events of domestic and international concern.1,8 Similarly, the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) developed by the RAND Corporation and the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) by Johns Hopkins University 9 use a variety of healthcare, economic, demographic, and political factors to assess the vulnerability of a country to prevent or contain an infectious disease outbreak.10 Using such indices, recent work has shown most of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to be at risk of COVID-19 importation and at reduced capacity to contain outbreaks due to lack of economic and medical resources.1 While it appears that the age groups at highest risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death (those >60 years old)6,11 may be proportionately less in many SSA countries than in other parts of the world, the populations in many of these countries are at increased risk of having untreated chronic conditions due to weak health systems.12 As a result, individuals with cardiovascular diseases or diabetes,13,14 sickle-cell disease, or conditions associated with immunosuppression,15,16 which exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV2 infection, may contribute to higher-than-expected mortality for younger age groups.\nWithin the first 30 days of the first introduction into the region on February 27, 2020, imported seeding events have occurred almost universally in SSA; however, capacity for detection, reporting, and control efforts varies.1,9 Across the region and with ranging degrees of enforcement,17,18 countries have implemented suites of preventative interventions, including school closures,19 curfews, and other social distancing measures,20 as well as border and airport closures.21 Countries reporting high numbers of cases since the original seeding in SSA were hypothesized to have stronger detection\/preparedness systems, such as South Africa and Rwanda. Lower observed case counts or delayed reporting of initial cases, relative to the date of first seeding in SSA, could be due to poor detection. It is the goal of this work to systematically collect and present information on COVID-19 cases in all affected countries in SSA during the first several weeks since known importation, with the aim of giving starting points for prediction of onward transmission.

Data on sex, age, travel history (including travel locations and dates of entry into the country where case confirmation occurred), date of reported confirmation, whether a case was due to importation or secondary transmission (both known and community transmission), and information on how the case was detected (e.g., active surveillance monitoring or selfpresentation) were recorded for each case. We searched using keywords such as 'COVID', 'Ministry of Health', 'situation report', 'press release', and\/or the date in the language of the respective countries, although more specific searches in news outlets were done in English. As information was collected from multiple sources, the daily case totals per country in the line list were compared with country-reported totals and\/or the WHO situation report totals. 23 The line list is provided as Supplementary Material.\nReported confirmed cases were assumed to be imported when classified as such by national institutions, or when case information included evidence of recent travel history. For countries with limited data available, information on whether cases were imported or due to local transmission was evaluated from the aggregate information in daily WHO situation reports, when feasible. Cases with uncertain travel history or not enough information to determine their importation status were included in the line list but not given a status.\nImported cases were described in terms of sex, 10-year age categories, and time between arrival in country and date that case confirmation was reported. Temporal trends in the frequency of importation events across SSA and in the continents from which they originated were evaluated.\nPreparedness and reporting. The availability of publicly reported data was assessed in terms of the average number of indicators which were reported or could be inferred for each imported case. The indicators included were sex, age, date of case confirmation, travel history, date of arrival in the country, and whether detection was due to active monitoring or self-presentation. Availability was assessed for the first 10 imported cases in each country (or for all cases in countries with fewer than 10 cases reported as of March 27, 2020).

A Poisson generalized linear model was applied to relate overall GHSI with case counts after adjusting for days since first reported importation as an offset. We also used a Cox proportional hazards model to consider the daily probability of a country reporting any case since the first introduction into the region, after adjusting for the country's overall GHSI and flight traffic. Flight traffic was included as the annual number of passengers carried by air transport (in billions).24 Data for the most recent year available was included for countries with information from 2016 until present. Thirteen out of the 49 SSA countries did not have recent flight traffic data and were excluded from the adjusted Cox model.\nRelationship between risk of severe morbidity and death and reporting. K-means clustering was conducted to identify groups of countries based on risk factors for high rates of severe morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 or lack of capacity to provide care. Factors included number of healthcare workers per 10,000 population,25,26 number of hospital beds per 1,000 population,27 proportion of population 60 years or older, and probability of dying between age 30 and exact age 70 from any of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease.28 Due to limited data available for Western Sahara, it was not included in the cluster analysis. The probability of a country having any case, average data availability score for first 10 importation events, and average cumulative reported cases per 100,000 population were calculated for each of the clusters.","publish_time_x":"2020-04-06","authors_x":"Laura A Skrip; Prashanth Selvaraj; Brittany Hagedorn; Andre Lin Ou\u00e9draogo; Navideh Noori; Dina Mistry; Jamie Bedson; Laurent H\u00e9bert-Dufresne; Samuel V Scarpino; Benjamin Muir Althouse","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20050203","H index_x":null,"section":"Methods","total_rank":0.0820073439,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[4494],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["model","model","model"],[],[],[],["analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk"],[],[],[],[],[],[],["age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],["health","health","Health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],["factor","Factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"3c15ba282c7261b3447e3a68a91e1a3b23b6fa3d","title_x":"In-flight Transmission Cluster of COVID-19: A Retrospective Case Series Running title: In-flight Transmission Cluster of COVID-19","abstract_x":"Objectives: No data were available about in-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Prevalence matters Authors: Affiliations: Main text","abstract_x":". Reaching a swift, reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 in the emergency departments is imperative to direct patients to proper care and to prevent disease dissemination. COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the identification of viral RNA through RT-PCR from oral-nasopharyngeal swabs, which however presents suboptimal sensitivity and may require several hours in overstressed laboratories. These drawbacks have called for an additional, complementary first line approach. CT is the gold standard method for the detection of interstitial pneumonia, a hallmark feature of COVID-19, often present in the asymptomatic stage of the disease. Here, we show that CT scan presents a sensitivity of 95.48% (std.err=0.35%), vastly outperforming RT-PCR. Additionally, as diagnostic accuracy is influenced by disease prevalence, we argue that predictive values provide a more precise measure of CT reliability in the current pandemics. We generated a model showing that CT scan is endowed with a high negative predictive value (> 90%) and positive predictive value (69 -84%), for the range of prevalence seen in countries with rampant dissemination. We conclude that CT is an expedite and reliable diagnostic tool to support first line triage of suspect COVID-19 patients in areas where the diffusion of the virus is widespread.","text_body":"In light of these considerations, we have computed PPV and NPV for CT scan, estimating from literature CT sensitivity and specificity with a meta-analysis ( Figure 2 ) and evaluating different pretest probabilities ( Figure 3 ).\nMore in detail, N=120 reports were identified through PUBMED database searching and screened.\nThe included publications needed to be in English language and include COVID-19 patients diagnosed with RT-PCR and reporting CT findings and performances.

Here, we propose that daily population-wide surveys that assess the development of symptoms caused by the virus could serve as a strategic and valuable tool for identifying such clusters to inform epidemiologists, public health officials, and policy makers. We show preliminary results from a survey of over 58,000 Israelis and call for an international consortium to extend this concept in order to develop predictive models. We expect such data to allow: Faster detection of spreading zones and patients; Obtaining a current snapshot of the number of people in each area who have developed symptoms; Predicting future spreading zones several days before an outbreak occurs; Evaluating the effectiveness of the various social distancing measures taken, and their contribution to reduce the number of symptomatic people. Such information can provide a valuable tool for decision makers to decide which areas need strengthening of social distancing measures and which areas can be relieved. Preliminary analysis shows that in neighborhoods with confirmed COVID-19 patient history, more responders report on COVID-19 associated symptoms, demonstrating the potential utility of our approach for detection of outbreaks. Researchers from other countries including the U.S","text_body":"strategies depend on many factors, including the local spread of COVID-19, healthcare system resources, economical and political factors, public adherence and their perception of the situation.\nIn Israel, the first infection of COVID-19 was confirmed on February 21st 2020, and in response, the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) instructed individuals who returned to Israel from specific countries, in which COVID-19 was spreading, to go into a 14-day home isolation. Since then, Israel has gradually imposed several measures aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus (Figure 2 ). On March 9th, 14-day home isolation was extended to individuals arriving from anywhere in the world starting from their date of arrival. Individuals that were in close contact, defined by being within approximately 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) from a COVID-19 patient for more than 15 minutes, were also instructed to be in home isolation for a similar time period. Symptomatic individuals with fever above 38 Celsius and respiratory symptoms (cough or shortness of breath) were instructed to stay home for two days after the fever has dropped down 3 . On March 11th, gatherings were limited to a maximum of 100 people and on March 15th, to 10 people, with attendees advised to keep a minimal distance of 2 m (6 ft 7 in) between one another. On March 19th, a national state of emergency was declared in the country, and Israeli citizens were banned from leaving their homes unless absolutely necessary with the exception of essential services that remained open. On March 20st, the first death of an Isreali citizen as a result of COVID-19 infection occurred.\nOne of the major challenges of the current pandemic to date is disease detection and diagnosis. While the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is detecting the virus by a real-time RT-PCR testing 4 , current resource and policy limitations in many countries restrict the amount of testing that can be performed. On March 12, 600 tests by 4 different laboratories were being done across Israel 5 . Although the number of tests per day is gradually growing, these cannot provide a full snapshot of the spread of the virus, especially since the MOHs guidelines are to test only individuals who were in close contact with a confirmed case.\nAs testing the entire population for the presence of 2019-nCoVis is currently not feasible, we developed a simple one-minute online questionnaire with the goal of early and temporal detection of geographic clusters in which the virus is spreading. The survey was posted online as a Google Form ( http:\/\/predict-corona.org\/ ) on March 14th. This additional information provides real-time analysis of symptoms over the course of days as the virus spreads through the population, and renders an informative situation snapshot.\nThe survey contains questions on age, gender, geographic location (city, street, zip code), isolation status and smoking habits. Furthermore, responders were asked to report whether they experience symptoms which were defined as common symptoms of COVID-19 by healthcare professionals based on the existing literature 6 . Several other symptoms which are not common in patients with COVID-19 infection but are common in other infectious diseases were also included to discern possible COVID-19 patients.. The symptoms that were included are cough, fatigue, myalgia (muscle pain), shortness of breath, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, diarrhea and nausea or vomiting. In addition, participants were asked about the existence of one of the following chronic health conditions: Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension, Ischemic heart disease, Asthma, chronic lung disease and chronic kidney disease. Participants were also asked to measure their daily body temperature and document it in the questionnaire (Figure 1 ). The number of reported symptoms divided by the number of symptoms in our predefined list. Symptoms in this list were predefined by the Israeli MOH and included: shortness of breath, fatigue, cough, muscle pains and a high fever (body temperature of over 38 degrees celsius). For responders under the age of 18nausea or vomiting was also included in the calculation.\nResponders were associated with an area in Israel using the address provided to create a colormap of Israel by the aggregated symptoms ratio as defined by the MOH.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-20","authors_x":"Hagai Rossman; Ayya Keshet; Smadar Shilo; Amir Gavrieli; Tal Bauman; Ori Cohen; Ran Balicer; Benjamin Geiger; Yuval Dor; Eran Segal","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.19.20038844","H index_x":null,"section":"","total_rank":0.0878552972,"risk_factors":["smoking","diabetes"],"match_indices":[2911,3572],"smoking_count":1,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact","contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age"],[],[],["health","Health","health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],["factor","factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"1a48450da54865731ffe01c0e289a63065b3b1fd","title_x":"Risk Factors Associated with Clinical Outcomes in 323 COVID-19 Patients in Wuhan, China","abstract_x":"With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 has been declared a global pandemic.

For COVID-19, model parameters were derived from the coronavirus epidemic in China, validated by epidemic data in Italy, then applied to the United States. We calculate that, in the U.S., the public is able to contain viral transmission by limiting the average number of contacts per person to less than 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. This increases the average social distance between individuals to 10 degrees of separation.","text_body":"The social network model provides a conceptual framework to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of individuals, that can be used to predict the influence of collective social behavior on overall pandemic trajectories. It shows the importance of social distancing, and the message that to contain the epidemic, every member of the public plays a crucial part in breaking the chain of transmission.\nGiven the current understanding of COVID-19 viral epidemiology, the epidemic in the U.S. can be controlled by limiting the average number of contacts per person to 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. For an average American family, the 7 contacts might be a spouse, two children, a friend, a neighbor, a colleague, and a cashier during grocery shopping. The time from the beginning of collective social action to the inflection point of the epidemic is about 3 viral generation intervals, totaling 2-3 weeks. Once daily new cases are decreasing, social distancing measures can be gradually relaxed, in phases, to prevent rebound of viral transmission.\nAfter social distancing becomes widely implemented and most people stay at home, the majority of new cases is expected to be from household transmission. One way to further reduce the epidemic is to bring all patients with confirmed COVID-19 to medical facilities to prevent the spread of infection at home, as was the practice in China, where moderate to severe cases were hospitalized while mild cases were kept in isolation centers until they were no longer infectious on viral nucleic acid testing. This is also the standard of care for other communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, where clinically stable patients are discharged home after three negative induced sputum samples.\nFinally, the social network model of COVID-19 transmission is expandable and extendable. This paper provides a simplified version using population averages for parameters. Researchers who have access to patient-level data can substitute these average values by their respective probability distributions to simulate stochastic viral transmission.\n.

COVID-19 Virus Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). CoV are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a new strain discovered in 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that has not been previously identified in humans [1] .\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory infection with common signs that include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death.\nii. Flattening the Curve On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic [2] . In their press conference, they were clear that pandemic was not a word they used lightly or carelessly or to cause unreasonable fear. They were also clear to highlight that this is the first pandemic to ever be caused by a coronavirus and that all countries can still act to change its course.\nPublic health and healthcare experts agree that mitigation is required in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prevent the collapse of healthcare systems. On any given day, health systems in the United States run close to capacity [3] , and so every transmission that can be avoided and every case that can be prevented has enormous impact.\niii. Identifying Vulnerable People\nThe risk of severe complications from COVID-19 is higher for certain vulnerable populations, particularly people who are elderly, frail, or have multiple chronic conditions. The risk of death has been difficult to calculate [4] , but a small study [5] of people who contracted COVID-19 in Wuhan suggests that the risk of death increases with age, and is also higher for those who have diabetes, heart disease, blood clotting problems, or have shown signs of sepsis. With an average death rate of 1%, the death rate rose to 6% for people with cancer, high blood pressure, or chronic respiratory disease, 7% for people with diabetes, and 10% for people with heart disease. There was also a steep age gradient; the death rate among people age 80 and over was 15% [6] .\nIdentifying who is most vulnerable is not necessarily straightforward. More than 55% of Medicare beneficiaries meet at least one of the risk criteria listed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [7] . People with the same chronic condition don't have the same risk, and simple rules can fail to capture complex factors like frailty [9] which makes people more vulnerable to severe infections.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-21","authors_x":"Dave DeCaprio; Joseph A Gartner; Thadeus Burgess; Sarthak Kothari; Shaayaan Sayed; Carol J McCall","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.16.20036723","H index_x":null,"section":"I.

At the current stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 404 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease severity. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the survival of individual patients with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity Creactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this paper suggests a simple and operable formula to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritised and potentially reducing the mortality rate.","text_body":"We considered the medical information of all patients collected between 10 January and 20\nFebruary 2020.

However, there are some striking differences on how COVID-19 is behaving in different countries. For instance, in Italy there has been strong curtailing of social interactions and COVID-19 mortality is still high. In contrast, Japan had some of the earlier cases, but the mortality is low despite not having adopted some the more restrictive social isolation measurements. These puzzling differences have been adjudicated to different cultural norms as well as differences in medical care standards. Here we propose an alternative explanation: that the country-by-country difference in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality can be partially explained by national policies on Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination.\nBCG is a live attenuated strain derived from an isolate of Mycobacterium bovis used widely across the world as a vaccine for Tuberculosis (TB), with many nations, including Japan and China, having a universal BCG vaccination policy in newborns 1 . Other countries such as Spain, France, and Switzerland, have discontinued their universal vaccine policies due to comparatively low risk for developing M. bovis infections as well as the proven variable effectiveness in preventing adult TB; countries such as the United States, Italy, and the Netherlands, have yet to adopt universal vaccine policies for similar reasons.\nSeveral vaccines including the BCG vaccination have been shown to produce positive \"heterologous\" or non-specific immune effects leading to improved response against other nonmycobacterial pathogens. For instance, BCG vaccinated mice infected with the vaccinia virus were protected by increased IFN-Y production from CD4+ cells 2 . This phenomenon was named 'trained immunity' and is proposed to be caused by metabolic and epigenetic changes leading to promotion of genetic regions encoding for pro-inflammatory cytokines 3 . BCG vaccination significantly increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically IL-1B, which has been shown to play a vital role in antiviral immunity 4 . Additionally, a study 5 in Guinea-Bissau found that children vaccinated with BCG were observed to have a 50% reduction in overall mortality, which was attributed to the vaccine's effect on reducing respiratory infections and sepsis.\nGiven our current understanding of the BCG vaccine's nonspecific immunotherapeutic mechanisms and by analyzing current epidemiological data, this investigation aims to identify a possible correlation between the existence of universal BCG vaccine policies and the morbidity and mortality associated to COVID-19 infections all over the world.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-28","authors_x":"Aaron Miller; Mac Josh Reandelar; Kimberly Fasciglione; Violeta Roumenova; Yan Li; Gonzalo H Otazu","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042937","H index_x":null,"section":"Introduction","total_rank":0.1522727273,"risk_factors":["tuberculosis"],"match_indices":[966],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":1,"has_tuberculosis?":true,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["investigati"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk"],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"490a0e0b43ae5d73e13a6b714626f15a3fef9fbf","title_x":"Correlation between universal BCG vaccination policy and reduced morbidity and mortality for COVID-19: an epidemiological study","abstract_x":"COVID-19 has spread to most countries in the world.

We included only countries with more than 1 million inhabitants. The mortality rate might be influenced by multiple factors including a country's standard of medical care. In order to account for that, we classified countries according to their GNI per capita in 2018 using the World Bank data (https:\/\/datahelpdesk.worldbank.org\/knowledgebase\/articles\/906519-worldbank-country-and-lending-groups). Countries were divided in three categories: low income (L) with an annual income of 1,025 dollars or less, lower middle income with an income between 1,026 and 3,995 dollars, and middle high and high income countries, which included countries with annual incomes over 3,996 dollars. In order to determine if BCG vaccination was protective for COVID-19 infections, we used the number of deaths per million inhabitants per country attributed to COVID-19 (see attached table) . Most of the countries with low-income levels (17\/18) reported zero deaths attributed to COVID-19 and have universal BCG policies in place consistent with a protective role of BCG vaccination. However, this might be because of underreporting and we have excluded them from the analysis. Middle high and high-income countries that have a current universal BCG policy (55 countries) had 0.78\u00b1 0.40 (mean\u00b1s.e.m) deaths per million people (see Figure 1 ). In contrast, middle high and high income countries that never had a universal BCG policy (5 countries) had a larger mortality rate, with 16.39 \u00b1 7.33 deaths per million people. This difference between countries was highly significant (p=8.64e-04, Wilcoxon rank sum test).\nMiddle high and high-income countries that have a universal BCG policy have some variability in the mortality rate. COVID-19 has increased lethality with age 7 . We wondered if countries that established a universal BCG policy earlier would have a reduced mortality rate, as older people that are more severely affected by COVID-19 would be protected. We analyzed the data from 28 countries where we had access to the start of the universal BCG vaccination policy. There was a positive significant correlation (\u03c1=0.44, p=0.02, linear correlation) between the year of the .

For instance, Iran has a current universal BCG vaccination policy but it just started in 1984, and has an elevated mortality with 19.7 deaths per million inhabitants. In contrast, Japan started its universal BCG policy in 1947 and has around 100 times less deaths per million people, with 0.28 deaths. Brazil started universal vaccination in 1920 and also has an even lower mortality rate of 0.0573 deaths per million inhabitants.\nAs the numbers of tuberculosis cases dropped in the late 20 th century, several middle high and high-income countries in Europe dropped the universal BCG policy between years 1963 and 2010. We hypothesized that although these countries do not have a universal current vaccination policy, they would also show a trend where the earlier they started their universal policy, the larger fraction of the elderly population would be covered, and the lower the death rate per million people. We analyzed 17 countries that dropped their universal BCG policy. There was also a positive significant correlation (\u03c1=0.54, p=0.02, linear correlation) between the year of the establishment of universal BCG vaccination and the mortality rate (see Figure 2 , right panel). For instance, Spain started their universal policy in 1965 and lasted until 1981 (16 years) and has a high mortality rate (29.5 deaths per million inhabitants). In contrast, Denmark started their policy in 1946 and ended in 1986 (40 years) and has almost 10 times less deaths per million inhabitants with 2.3 deaths.\nWe have found evidence that BCG vaccination is correlated with reduced mortality rates produced by COVID-19. Mortality rates are a robust measure that has less dependence to the levels of COVID-19 testing. However, mortality rates per country relate to both the number of cases present in a country as well as the dead probability for individual cases. We wondered if BCG vaccination would also affect the spread of disease with the caveat that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is going to depend strongly on the number of tests performed per country.\nThe countries with low-income levels (18) reported few number of cases of COVID-19 per million inhabitants: 0.32 \u00b1 0.09. However, the issue of underreporting might be more critical for estimating the number of cases and we have excluded the low income countries from further analysis. Middle high and high-income countries that have a current universal BCG policy (55 countries) had 59.54\u00b1 23.29 (mean\u00b1s.e.m) cases per million inhabitants (see Figure 3 ). Consistent with a role of BCG in slowing spread of COVID-19, middle high and high income countries that never had a universal BCG policy (5 countries) had about 4 times the number of cases per million inhabitants, with 264.90\u00b1 134.88. This difference between countries was significant (p=0.0064, Wilcoxon rank sum test), suggesting that broad BCG vaccination along with other measures could slow the spread of COVID-19.\nWe also wondered if the middle high and high-income countries that have current universal vaccination policies (28 countries) would show a relationship between the number of cases and the year that the universal vaccination started. Interestingly, there was no significant correlation (r=0.21, p=0.27) between the year that vaccination started and the total number of COVID-19 cases, suggesting that early vaccination of the elderly population was not a factor in reducing the number of cases (see Figure 4 ).","publish_time_x":"2020-03-28","authors_x":"Aaron Miller; Mac Josh Reandelar; Kimberly Fasciglione; Violeta Roumenova; Yan Li; Gonzalo H Otazu","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042937","H index_x":null,"section":"Results","total_rank":0.060197664,"risk_factors":["tuberculosis"],"match_indices":[3291],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":1,"has_tuberculosis?":true,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["analysi","analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti"],[],[],["age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["factor","factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"490a0e0b43ae5d73e13a6b714626f15a3fef9fbf","title_x":"Correlation between universal BCG vaccination policy and reduced morbidity and mortality for COVID-19: an epidemiological study","abstract_x":"COVID-19 has spread to most countries in the world.

Italy, where the COVID 19 mortality is very high, never implemented universal BCG vaccination. On the other hand, Japan had one of the early cases of COVID-19 but it has maintained a low mortality rate despite not implementing the most strict forms of social isolation 8 . Japan have been implementing BCG vaccination since 1947. Iran had also been heavily hit by COVID-19 and it started its universal BCG vaccination policy only in 1984 potentially leaving anybody over 36 years old unprotected.\nWhy did COVID-19 spread in China despite having a universal BCG policy since the 1950's? During the Cultural Revolution (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) (1976) , tuberculosis prevention and treatment agencies were disbanded and weakened 9 . We speculate that this could have created a pool of potential hosts that would be affected by and spread COVID-19. Currently, however, the situation in China seems to be improving.\nOur data suggests that BCG vaccination seem to significantly reduce mortality associated with COVID-19. We also found that the earlier that a country established a BCG vaccination policy, the stronger the reduction in their number of deaths per million inhabitants, consistent with the idea that protecting the elderly population might be crucial in reducing mortality. However, there is still not proof that BCG inoculation at old age would boost defenses in elderly humans, but it seems to do so in Guinea pigs against M. tuberculosis 10 .\nBCG vaccination has been shown to produce broad protection against viral infections and sepsis 11 , raising the possibility that the protective effect of BCG might be not directly related to actions on COVID-19 but on associated co-occurring infections or sepsis. However, we also found that BCG vaccination was correlated with a reduction in the number of COVID-19 reported infections in a country suggesting that BCG might confer some protection specifically against COVID-19. The broad use of the BCG vaccine across a population could reduce the number of carriers, and combined with other measures could act to slow down or stop the spread of COVID-19.\nDifferent countries use different BCG vaccination schedules 6 , as well as different strains of the bacteria 12 . We have not divided the data depending on the strain used to determine which strains are better at stopping spread of infection, as well as reducing mortality in the elderly population. As each country used the same strain for the whole population, difference in strains for different purposes should be gathered in randomized control trials with different subjects from the same population tested with different strains.\nUSA and other countries like Italy without a universal vaccination policy but with high fraction of immigrants from countries with different universal BCG policies and using different strains offer the possibility to perform epidemiological studies to determine vaccination schedules and strains that would optimize protection against COVID-19.\nThe correlation between the beginning of universal BCG vaccination and the protection against COVID-19 suggests that BCG might confer long-lasting protection against the current strain of coronavirus. However, randomized controlled trials using BCG are required to determine how fast an immune response develops that protects against COVID-19. BCG is generally innocuous with the main side effect the development of inflammation at the site of injection. However, BCG is contraindicated in immune compromised people as well as pregnant women 13 , so care should be taken when applying these possible intervention for COVID-19.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-28","authors_x":"Aaron Miller; Mac Josh Reandelar; Kimberly Fasciglione; Violeta Roumenova; Yan Li; Gonzalo H Otazu","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042937","H index_x":null,"section":"Discussion","total_rank":0.0987124464,"risk_factors":["pregnancy","tuberculosis"],"match_indices":[4007,1140,1924],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":1,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":2,"has_tuberculosis?":true,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["randomized controlled"],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"461a32146936c2db3491cfe5fe95fbabae4a3d27","title_x":"Prevalence, Severity and Mortality associated with COPD and Smoking in patients with COVID-19: A Rapid Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Authors contributions","abstract_x":"JSA: Conception, design, data acquisition, analysis, interpretation, drafting manuscript for intellectually important content, and approval of final version; TO: Data acquisition and approval of final version; AMA: Analysis, interpretation and approval of final version; MA: Analysis, interpretation and approval of final version; SM: Analysis, interpretation and approval of final version; AA: data acquisition, analysis and approval of final version; SQ: interpretation and approval of final version; SM: interpretation, and approval of final version.; JRH: Conception, design, analysis, interpretation, and approval of final version.","text_body":"The emergence in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China of a novel pneumonia of unknown origin on the 31 st of December, 2019 was the start of an outbreak which would later be declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) (1). The name COVID-19 (acronym for \"coronavirus disease 2019\") was coined on the 11 th of February 2020 to describe presentation with severe acute respiratory disease (2). COVID-19 is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus belongs to the family of single stranded RNA viruses some of which have been previously described to be responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (3, 4) . Although the symptoms and clinical presentation of COVID-19 is similar to SARS and MERS, the rate of spread is greater (5) . As of 25 th of March 2020, the total number of confirmed case of COVID-19 stands at 459,419 with 20,818 deaths globally and the number is projected to increase (6) .\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common, persistent and preventable dysfunction of the lung associated with limitation in airflow. COPD is a complex disease associated with abnormalities of the airway and\/ or alveoli which is predominantly caused by exposure to noxious gases and particulates over a long period (7). With a global prevalence of 251 million cases in 2016, and 3.17 million (5%) deaths in 2015 alone, COPD was ranked by the WHO as the third leading cause of death especially with a particular burden in low-and middle-income countries (8, 9) . This burden is predicted to grow due mainly to increased global exposure to tobacco, aging populations, poor awareness and inadequate access to diagnosis (10) . COPD exacerbations are a major event in the natural history of the disease associated with worsening of symptoms often resulting in hospitalisation and poor prognosis (11) . Various factors have been described to contribute to acute worsening of COPD, however, viral infection remains the main trigger, including seasonal coronaviruses (12) (13) (14) .\n.

A recent systematic review on COVID-19 and smoking including five studies found that smoking was most likely associated with the negative outcomes. This recommended further research to explore this in more detail due to limited studies (32) . Evidence from other respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, has shown that inhaled tobacco smoke raises the transmission rate and severity of viral respiratory tract infections (53) . It seems there is underlying mechanisms behind this prevalence, as smoking has been related to higher expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) (pre-print) (54) . However, as more reports globally from diverse racial and genetic contexts become available, differences in the production of ACE2 can be further evaluated and linked to how they lead to COVID-19 vulnerability in different groups (55) .\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to systematically evaluate existing literature with a focus on risk of COVID-19 on COPD.

Due to its increasing threat to global health, WHO has declared that the COVID-19 epidemic was a global public health emergency. The causative pathogen of the COVID-19 outbreak has been identified as a highly infectious novel coronavirus which is referred to as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [1] [2] [3] The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is thought to be via at least 3 sources: 1) inhalation of liquid droplets produced by and\/or 2) close contact with infected persons and 3) contact with surfaces contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. 4 Moreover, aerosol transmission of pathogens has been shown in confined spaces. 5, 6 There are many respiratory diseases spread by the airborne route such as tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox. 7, 8 A retrospective cohort study conducted after the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong in 2003 suggested that airborne spread may have played an important role in the transmission of that disease. 9 At present, there is little information on the characteristics of airborne SARS-CoV-2 containing aerosols, their concentration patterns and behaviour during airborne transmission due to the difficulties in sampling virus-laden aerosols and challenges in their quantification at low concentration. Such a lack of understanding limits effective risk assessment, prevention and control of COVID-19 disease outbreaks. This study on airborne SARS-CoV-2 was conducted in different areas inside two hospitals and public areas in Wuhan, China, the epicenter city during the initial disease outbreak.

Using the incidence data of COVID-19, we estimate the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6), which indicates sustained transmission and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.","text_body":"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged out of the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019 has already demonstrated its potential to generate explosive outbreaks in confined settings and cross borders following human mobility patterns (1) . While COVID-19 frequently induces mild symptoms common to other respiratory infections, it has also exhibited an ability to generate severe disease among certain groups including older populations and individuals with underlying health issues such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes (2) . Nevertheless, a clear picture of the epidemiology of this novel coronavirus is still being elucidated.\nThe number of cases of COVID-19 in the province of Hubei, the disease epicenter, quickly climbed following an exponential growth trend. The total number of COVID-19 cases is at 81,109 including 2718 deaths in China as of February 26, 2020 (3) . Fortunately, by February 15, 2020 the daily number of new reported cases in China started to decline across the country although Hubei Province is still reporting hundreds of cases per day as of February 26 th , 2020 (3) . While the epidemic continues to decline in China, more than 2,900 COVID-19 cases have been reported in 37 countries outside of China including South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran, Singapore, U.S., and Thailand (3) . In particular, South Korea has quickly become the second hardest hit country with COVID-19, with steadily increasing number of cases over the last few days. Hence, it is crucial to monitor the progression of these outbreaks and assess the effects of various public health measures including the social distancing measures in real time.\nThe first case in South Korea was identified on January 20, 2020 followed by the detection of one or two cases on average in the subsequent days. However, the number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection started to increase rapidly on February 19, 2020 with a total of 1,261 confirmed COVID-19 cases including twelve deaths reported as of February 26, 2020 according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) (4). The epicenter of the South Korean COVID-19 outbreak has been identified in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million people, approximately 150 miles South East of Seoul.\nThe rapid spread of COVID-19 in South Korea has been attributed one case linked to a superspreading event that has led to at least 40 secondary cases stemming from church services in the city of Daegu (5, 6 ). This has led to sustained transmission chains of COVID-19, with about 52% of the cases associated with the church cluster in Daegu (7) . Moreover, three other clusters have been reported including one set in Chundo Daenam hospital in Chungdo-gun, Gyeongsanggbuk-do (114 cases), one Pilgrimage to Israel cluster in Gyeongsanggbuk-do (31 cases) and a cluster A composed of one imported and 11 local cases in Seoul. These few clusters have become the major driving force of the infection. A total of 33 cases were imported while the three major clusters are composed of local cases as described in Supplementary Table S1 .\nTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Korea has been exacerbated by amplified transmission in confined settings including a hospital and a church in the city of Daegu. The hospital-based outbreak alone involves 114 individuals including 9 hospital staff (8) , which is reminiscent of past outbreaks of SARS .

However, some women and their partners can experience a range of negative emotions during this period, including anxiety and depression. Globally, the extent and adverse impacts of maternal mental health problems are increasingly recognised. As the World Health Organisation (WHO) states \"virtually all women can develop mental disorders during pregnancy and in the first year after delivery\". Conditions such as extreme stress, emergency and conflict situations and natural disasters can increase risks for specific mental health disorders [1] . Maternal and parental mental health problems are associated with longer term risks for the mother and partner, and for their children [2] [3] [4] [5] . This raises the question: how are we safeguarding the short-and longer-term mental health of pregnant women and their partners in the age of coronavirus? Apart from the overall population level pandemic-related stress, there is still a limited formal evidence-base about the nature and clinical consequences of the various versions of coronavirus (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 or HCoV-19) for a pregnant woman. There is even less information about the mental health impacts consequent to self-isolation, living in a household with an affected person, limited access to goods\/services and to routine or emergency health and social care. For women (and especially for those living in poverty, in poor or cramped housing), these issues may be exacerbated if they are expected to be the main carers for elderly or infirm relatives, or for young children, while living with multiple family members in confined spaces.\nThe most recent WHO guidelines for antenatal and for intrapartum care reinforce the importance of positive clinical and psychosocial pregnancy and childbirth experiences to optimise the physical and psychosocial wellbeing of mother, baby, and the family in the short and longer term [6] [7] . It is therefore critical that knowledge about the clinical impact of COVID-19 in pregnancy is balanced with knowledge about the potential psycho-social impact, so that the current rapid restructuring of maternity services to cope with the pandemic can take account of all the relevant consequences.\nWhat is currently known about COVID- 19 [15] . The key findings from these studies have been captured in a number of rapid COVID-19 guidelines produced by professional and global authorities.

There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted vertically from the mother to the fetus during pregnancy. This is based on; one study of 9 pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia [8] ;a single case report [9] ; a study of 41 pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 [11] ; and a study of 15 pregnant women with COVID-19 [10] .\n2. There is no reported transmission during birth. Infants born vaginally or by caesarean section, to mothers with coronavirus infection, have so far been shown to be negative to COVID-19. This is based on: an observational study of 4 mothers infected with COVID-19 and 3 newborns [12] ; a single case report [9] ; and an observational study on 11 mothers infected with COVID-19 and their newborns [10] .\nNo virus was detected in the amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab and breastmilk samples (results from 6 patients with confirmed COVID-19) [8] .\nA recently reported single case of a neonate that tested positive for COVID-19 does not provide definitive evidence of intrauterine or intrapartum infection, as no intrauterine tissue sample was tested, and the neonate was tested 30 hours after birth. However, this case does suggest that cross infection can occur at some point between pregnancy and the early postnatal period [8] [13] .\n3. Despite this single case, the risk\/benefit calculation is that mothers and babies should not be routinely separated after birth to prevent transmission of COVID-19. In the two published studies from China referenced above (total of 5 participants), infants were isolated from their mothers immediately after birth for up to 14 days [9] [12] . However, the guidelines from WHO for mothers infected with COVID-19 are \"Close contact and early, exclusive breastfeeding helps a baby to thrive\", \"Hold your newborn skin-to-skin\" and \"share a room with your baby\" [16] . In addition, UNICEF recommendations during the period of the outbreak are \"Regardless of feeding method, it is essential that sick and preterm babies' profound need for emotional attachment with their parents\/primary caregiver continues to be considered. Keeping mothers and babies together wherever possible and responding to the baby's need for love and comfort will not only enable breastmilk\/breastfeeding, but will also protect the baby's short-and long-term health, wellbeing and development. In addition, this will support the mother's mental wellbeing in the postnatal period\" [17] .\n.

There is no evidence or biological indication that COVID-19 can be transmitted through breastmilk. As the benefits of breastfeeding are well-known, particularly in terms of boosting the infant's immune system, and maternal and child bonding, WHO recommends that \"women with COVID-19 can breastfeed of they wish to do so\". Given the potential for postnatal transmission indicated by the single case of neonatal infection noted above, WHO adds that women who are breastfeeding, and, indeed, those who are giving babies formula milk, should \"practice respiratory hygiene during feeding, wearing a mask where available, wash hands before and after touching the baby and routinely clean and disinfect surfaces they have touched\" [16] . 5 . In one large observational studies of 2143 paediatric patients with COVID-19 in China, one child (aged 14) died. Although the overall incidence of severe disease was highest in the under one year old group (10.6%) this was still much lower than in adult patients (18.5%) suggesting that babies and children are much less at risk of adverse effects of being infected with COVID-19 and much less likely to die as a result than adults. [14] .\n6. There is no evidence to date that pregnant women are more likely to acquire COVID-19 than other young adults, or that, once they have it they have more severe disease, or that those with mild or severe disease have a higher risk of fetal distress or of adverse fetal outcomes.

It is especially important when two of the Millennium Development Goals (4 and 5) emphasise on maternal and child health, stating that overall health cannot be achieved without mental health [2] . Psychosocial stress, particularly during early pregnancy, has been identified as a key risk factor in the aetiology of a preterm birth [19] . The potential (ill-informed) practices of separating mothers from their infants post birth in the name of protection from COVID-19 infection, such as witnessed in China, and a lack of certainty leading to early cessation of breastfeeding, have harmful impacts on maternal mental health via 'toxic stress' [20] and perceptions of self-blame and shame [21] . The links between social isolation and depression are well reported [22] , and potentially magnified when coupled with juggling the demands of confined family members. A recent article titled The Coronavirus Is a Disaster for Feminism also highlights how women's independence is the 'silent victim' of the pandemic due to women being more likely than males to take responsibility for caregiving activities [23] .

The causative pathogen was identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] . As of 06 March 2020, COVID-19 has caused 80,735 confirmed cases in China, of whom 3,045 died and 5,737 were admitted into ICU [2] . In response to this fast-spreading epidemic, the Chinese government has locked down the epicenter Wuhan city since 23 January 2020, and implemented a series of social distancing measures such as strict traffic restrictions, forbidden social gatherings, closure of residential communities [3] . The epidemiological data showed that most cases had mild symptoms, and overall case fatality rate was 2.3%. Although the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 seems considerably lower than two previous zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it was far more efficient to transmit between close contacts. [4] Particularly, this novel coronavirus has caused special concerns in pregnant women, because both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been found to cause severe complications in pregnant women [5] . Several reports on suspicious vertical transmission of this virus have further increased such concerns [6] . Although the recent laboratory studies and clinical reports did not find strong evidence to support a vertical transmission route, the possibility still cannot be completely ruled out [7] [8] [9] .\nClinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 infection have been widely reported [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, the clinical reports on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain sparse. An earlier study by Chen et al reported nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia, who took cesarean section in a tertiary hospital of Wuhan [7] . These patients showed clinical symptoms similar to non-pregnant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. They also claimed that there was no evidence of vertical transmission. To date, none of previous studies have compared maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia to those without pneumonia, to investigate the adverse effects of COVID-19 infection on pregnancy.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-13","authors_x":"Na Li; Lefei Han; Min Peng; Yuxia Lv; Yin Ouyang; Kui Liu; Linli Yue; Qiannan Li; Guoqiang Sun; Lin Chen; Lin Yang","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.10.20033605","H index_x":null,"section":"Introduction","total_rank":0.1962174941,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[1161,1261,1769,1870,2029,2225,2352],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":17,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":true,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],["route"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"e08d308e5923cb4f741d34a6cd3548a17a04a2b1","title_x":"Maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia: a case-control study","abstract_x":"The ongoing epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 have caused serious concerns about its potential adverse effects on pregnancy.

We followed the clinical diagnosis criteria for COVID-19 pneumonia in the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th edition) by the National Health Commission of China [15] . Throat swabs were collected from all these patients and sent to the laboratory of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention for tests of SARS-CoV-2. Diagnosis criteria of COVID-19 infection include 1) typical chest CT imaging of patchy shadows and ground glass opacity, and 2) positive in reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2. However, previous studies argued that false negative cases might be common for COVID-19 infection cases due to low virus titers, sampling at late stage of illness, and inappropriate swabbing sites [7] . Given overloaded healthcare systems and limited test capacities during our study period, we were concerned about underreporting of COVID-19 cases if solely relying on laboratory tests. Therefore, in this study we also included the suspected patients with typical chest CT imaging but negative in RT-PCR tests. Eleven pregnant women who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were classified as laboratory confirmed case group, and eighteen with typical chest CT imaging but tested negative in RT-PCR tests as suspected case group.\nThe control group of pregnant women without pneumonia during hospital stay were randomly selected from the medical records by an investigator (MP), who was not involved in statistical analysis. Only those aged 25-35 years were selected to match the age range of cases. We selected 121 women who were admitted during the same period (control 2020 group). Considering the potential adverse effects of mental stress caused by city lockdown and severe epidemics, we also included a second control group of 121 women admitted during January 24 -February 11, 2019 (control 2019 group). Blood test results were also retrieved from medical records.

For instance, Sydney may have higher rates of diabetes or obesity than Wuhan, which might affect death rates, while Wuhan has higher rates of smoking, especially in men. These variations could be implemented by changing the age-related parameters, assuming these conditions are aligned with different age profiles.\nThe differential equations that govern the flow of people through the compartments are as follows, as in [6] :\nFor instance, the first equation says that the rate of flow of people out from S a (susceptible in age category a), to E a (exposed) at time t, is the total infectious population I b times the infection rate \u03b2 a at time t, times the proportion of the population still susceptible, S a (t)\/N . Patients leave the hospital on average after t h days, so each day on average H a (t)\/t h patients leave hospital (seen in the expression for dH a \/dt). Of these, c a go to the C a (the ICU), and (1 \u2212 c a ) recover (go to R a ).\nIf a patient needs ICU but ICU is not available, we assume (following [6] ), that leads to a fatality.\nTo summarize the parameters, we have:\n\u2022 Transmission rate \u03b2 a (t). This is essentially a function of the basic reproductive number R 0 , but also accounts for mitigation effects and seasonal forcing: \u03b2 a (t) := R 0 M (t)(1 + \u03b5 cos(2\u03c0(t \u2212 t max ))).\nThe expression for seasonal forcing is standard (see eg [1, Sect. 1.8]), but includes the mitigation effect M (t) on R 0 . \u2022 Average times in each state of the model are given by t l : latent time exposed before becoming infectious, t i : time infectious before either recovering or becoming severely ill, t h : time severe, in hospital, before either recovering or becoming critical, t c : time critical, in ICU, before either dying or leaving the ICU within the hospital. \u2022 Age-specific parameters:\nm a is the proportion of cases in I a that stay mild (asymptomatic).\nc a is the proportion of cases in H a that become severe.\nf a is the proportion of cases in C a that are fatal.\nA.2.

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is sharply climbing in China during the past decades. According to the latest nationally representative cross-sectional survey in mainland China in 2013, the estimated prevalence of diabetes in elderly participants (\u226560 years old) was 20.2%\n[4]. Previous studies reported 9% to 14% prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19\npatients [1, 8, 13, 15 ]. Here, we reported a higher prevalence rate of diabetes in these patients, which might be due to the larger proportion of geriatric patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 in our study. The median age of all the participants was 64 years old, which was older than the data previously reported [1, 7, 8 ]. In the current study, 53.5% of the patients were male, and the percentage is similar to that reported by Wang et al The laboratory findings on admission showed that leucocytes and neutrophils counts and the proportion of increased leucocytes were higher in COVID-19 patients with diabetes than those without, which might be explained by the fact that diabetic patients were more susceptible to pathogens after viral infection due to lower immune function. During hospitalization, the diabetic patients were more likely to receive .

Decreased lymphocytes counts and eosinophil counts were also common in these patients; this was consistent with the results of previous studies [15] . However, no significant differences were found in the cell counts and percentage lymphocytes and eosinophil counts between COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes.

In secondary analyses, we (a) omit number of hospital beds; (b) omit number of tested cases in each state; (c) omit smoking rate and BMI from BRFSS; (d) omit summer\/winter temperature\/relative humidity; (e) exclude data from New York state; (f) exclude data from counties with less than 10 confirmed cases.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate whether patients with underlying diseases are more susceptible to coronavirus infection than healthy population. Firstly, we analyzed the expression of ACE2 in lung in the different populations. The expression level of ACE2 was not significantly altered between healthy populations and patients with chronic respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and asthma ( Figure 1A , 1B, and 1C, p-value > 0.05).

Thus, there may be no significant difference in the susceptibility of 2019-nCov infection between healthy population and patients with chronic respiratory diseases.\nSecondly, we found that the level of ACE2 expression was markedly upregulated in long-term smokers ( Figure 1D , p-value < 0.05). However, the p-value between baseline and post-acute smoke exposure (ASE) group (24 hours after smoking 3 cigarettes) was 0.073 ( Figure 1E ). It was assumed that the long-term smoking could elevate the expression of ACE2 and thus, increase the susceptibility to 2019-nCoV infection.\nThirdly, we analyzed the expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cells after being infected with SARS-CoV. The result suggested that 24 hours after SARS-CoV infection, the expression of ACE2 dramatically increased compared to 12 hours. After 48 hours, the expression of ACE2 remained at a high level. This indicated that ACE2 not only played a critical role in viral susceptibility but also may be involved in post-infection regulation.","publish_time_x":"2020-02-05","authors_x":"Xiang He; Lei Zhang; Qin Ran; Anying Xiong; Junyi Wang; Dehong Wu; Feng Chen; Guoping Li","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.02.03.20020206","H index_x":null,"section":"ACE2 expression features in lung","total_rank":0.197740113,"risk_factors":["smoking"],"match_indices":[1374,1466,1509,1590],"smoking_count":4,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],[],[],[],["health","health","health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"5d3612cd95331a2f0c43ef9d03ce583b5ff8c995","title_x":"Integrative Bioinformatics Analysis Provides Insight into the Molecular Mechanisms of 2019-nCoV","abstract_x":"The 2019-nCoV is reported to share the same entry (ACE2) as SARS-CoV according to the updated findings.

The major findings of this study include: (1) ALI is more common in the critically ill COVID-19 patients; (2) Accumulating data demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused multiple organ injuries, including myocardial dysfunction, lymphopenia and even acute renal These results provide evidence that ALI on admission is associated with the severity of COVID-19 patients.\nSeveral studies found that elderly COVID-19 patients had more severe symptoms and signs than younger cases [18, 19] . The present study analyzed the influence of gender and age on SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI. We showed that the levels of serum total bilirubin, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and glutamyl transferase were higher in males than in females. By contrast, serum albumin level was lower in males than in females. Further analysis showed that total bilirubin, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and glutamyl transferase were higher in older patients than younger ones. By contrast, albumin and globulin were lower in older patients than younger ones. According to several clinical reports, COVID-19 patients with comorbidities had worse prognosis [14, 20] . Indeed, this study found that 40.8% COVID-19 patients were with diabetes, 35.2% with hypertension, and 4.5% with liver disease. To explore the influence of comorbidities on ALI, the present study analyzed hepatic functional indexes among different groups. Our results showed that alkaline phosphatase was slightly higher in COVID-19 patients with hypertension than those without hypertension. In addition, alkaline phosphatase and glutamyl transferase were slightly higher in patients with diabetes than those without diabetes.\nBy contrast, albumin was slightly lower in patients with either diabetes or hypertension than those neither diabetes nor hypertension. Unexpectedly, comorbidity with liver disease did not influence hepatic functional indexes of COVID-19 patients.\nLymphocytopenia is one of the important early manifestations during the pathogenesis of COVID-19 [21, 22] . This study analyzed the influence of lymphocytopenia on SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI. We found that almost all hepatic functional indexes were worse among patients with lymphocytopenia than without lymphocytopenia. To exclude potential confounding factors, multivariable logistic regression was used to further analyze the impact of gender, age and comorbidities on SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI. We found that male, older age, comorbidity with diabetes and lymphocytopenia .

In addition, older age, lymphocytopenia and comorbidity with diabetes were independent risk factors of hypoproteinemia.\nMoreover, male and lymphocytopenia were independent risk factors of hepatocellular injury. Taken together, the present study provide evidence that male, older age, comorbidity with diabetes and lymphocytopenia are major risk factor of ALI among COVID-19 patients.\nThe influence of ALI on the prognosis of COVID-19 is unclear. The present study analyzed the impact of ALI on death risk of COVID-19 patients. Our results showed that the fatality rate was higher in COVID-19 patients with hypoproteinemia than those without hypoproteinemia. Moreover, the fatality rate was higher in COVID-19 patients with cholestasis than without cholestasis. Our results suggest that hypoproteinemia and cholestasis at the early stage elevate death risk of COVID-19 patients. It is especially interesting whether SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI recovers in a short time after discharge. In the present study, 150 COVID-19 patients were followed up and measured hepatic functions 14 days after discharge. Unexpectedly, no significant difference on the values of serum direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, TBA, alkaline phosphatase, glutamyl transferase and AST was observed when admission and 14 days after discharge. Although serum albumin level was rebounded on 14 days after discharge, 17% COVID-19 patients remained below normal range. Our results indicate that hepatic functional indexes of two-third COVID-19 patients remain abnormal 14 days after discharge. Therefore, further follow-up is required to further evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection causes permanent liver injury.\nThe mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 evokes ALI remains unclear.\nAccumulating data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes multiple organ injuries, such as lymphopenia, myocardial dysfunction and acute renal failure [9, [15] [16] [17] 25] . In the present study, we showed that oxygenation index, an index of respiratory function, was positively correlated with serum albumin. By contrast, there was a weak negative correlation between oxygenation index and ALT, AST, AST\/ALT, and glutamyl .

These results suggest that respiratory failure may contribute, at least partially, to SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI. Several studies demonstrated that ACE2, as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was expressed in cholangiocytes and hepatocytes [26, 27] . Therefore, this study does not exclude that SARS-CoV-2 evokes ALI partially through infecting liver. It is required to further explore whether human liver is another target of SARS-CoV-2 injection.\nIn summary, this study aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI among 355 COVID-19 patients from two hospitals. Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI was more common in critically ill patients. In addition, male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus and lymphopenia were more susceptible to ALI. We provide evidence that ALI at the early stage elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI has not recovered completely 14 days after discharge. Therefore, it is necessary to further evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection causes permanent liver injury.

The prediction of Furin cleavage site (FCS) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 had mutations near FCS (F1-2), which caused changes in the structure and electrostatic distribution of S protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs.

In the patients with COVID-19, some special population should be paid special attention to. Epidemiological survey shows that COVID-19 patients with underlined conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or the elderly are not only susceptible, but also often more serious.

However, as far as we know, the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on chronic kidney disease patients, especially uremic HD patients has not yet been reported. Considering the large population size of HD patients (There are 7184 registered patients receiving HD treatment in 61 centers in Wuhan city.), the high aggregation and mobility of HD center population, and the low immune function of uremic patients [10] , the situation of HD patients under the COVID-19 epidemic should not be ignored.\nIn this study, we described an outbreak of COVID-19 in one HD center in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, which is located in the downtown of Wuhan city of China. A cluster of HD patients contracted COVID-19 were surveyed and followed until the day on February 17, 2020.

As the number of infected individuals requiring hospitalization increases, several medical societies have put forth guidelines to limit the strain on the healthcare system. These primarily include the suspension of non-urgent medical care and elective procedures.\nOn March 17 th, 2020, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) published recommendations calling for stopping the initiation of any new treatment cycles, including ovulation induction (OI), intrauterine inseminations (IUI), and in vitro fertilization (IVF) (2) . In addition, ASRM recommended strong consideration should be given to suspending all embryo transfers, whether fresh or frozen. In light of these recommendations, fertility centers across the United States have had widespread cycle cancellations for patients planning or undergoing fertility treatment.\nAt this time, little is known on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy, transmission, and fetal wellbeing, but preliminary data looks promising (3) (4) (5) (6) . As more information is gathered, guidelines will likely continue to evolve. However, fertility treatment is often a time-sensitive issue, particularly for patients with advanced reproductive age or diminished ovarian reserve. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) infertility is defined as \"a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse (7) .\" The indefinite postponement of fertility treatment can lead to an irreversible ability to conceive with their own gametes in certain patient populations.

Respiratory diseases, including the 2003 SARS epidemic, remain only about two months in any given population, although peak incidence and lethality can vary. The epidemiological data suggest that at least two strains of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 virus have evolved during its migration from Mainland China to Europe. South Korea, Iran, Italy, and Italy's neighbors were hit by the more dangerous \"SKII\" variant. While the epidemic in continental Asia is about to end, and in Europe about to level off, the more recent epidemic in the younger US population is still increasing, albeit not exponentially anymore. The peak level will likely depend on which of the strains has entered the U.S. first. The same models that help us to understand the epidemic also help us to choose prevention strategies. Containment of high-risk people, like the elderly, and reducing disease severity, either by vaccination or by early treatment of complications, is the best strategy against a respiratory virus disease. Social distancing or \"lockdowns\" can be effective during the month following the peak incidence in infections, when the exponential increase of cases ends. Earlier containment of low-risk people merely prolongs the time the virus needs to circulate until the incidence is high enough to initiate \"herd immunity\". Later containment is not helpful, unless to prevent a rebound if containment started too early.","text_body":"Mainland China is not reporting relevant numbers of novel cases anymore and Hubei reports no new cases since 03-19. The number of new cases in South Korea also has declined to low levels since its peak around 02-30. Maritime Southeast Asia continues to show low levels of new cases only (<3\/M\/d), with the possible exception of Singapore and Malaysia\/Brunei. Japan and the Philippines are slowly approaching a 2\/M\/d incidence.\nThe data are consistent with the same \"SKII\" strain traveling from China via South Korea and Iran to Italy. Iran was hit about a week after South Korea (around 03-07), with a similar peak incidence, but higher lethality (red bars in Fig 2) . The data also suggests a second wave of infections in Iran, which may have peaked on 03-15. Italy was hit a week after the first wave in Iran (which peaked around 03-07\/08, Fig 4a) . Incidence in Italy reached a substantially higher incidence than reported in Iran. The peak incidence in Italy may have been reached on 03-22 (at about 100\/M\/d).\nWithout sufficiently detailed genetic data, it is not clear whether the high lethality in Italy is due to genetic variations in the virus or to Italy having the second oldest populations in the world (after Japan). A 03-20 report by the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, (COVID-19 Surveillance Group 2020) however, implicates that age and comorbidities played a role -among 3200 deaths, mostly in Lombardy and Emilia-Romana, median age was 80 years (IQR 73-85, only were 36 below the age of 50), 98.8% had at least one comorbidity (hypertension: 74%, diabetes: 34%, ischemic heart disease: 30%, atrial fibrillation, 22%, chronic renal failure: 20%, \u2026).\nThe epidemiological data does not support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 spread from Munich in Germany to Italy.

While Italy has many people 65 years and older (23%, second only to Japan data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/SP.POP. 65UP . TO.ZS ) , the relatively small differences or age distribution within Europe (e.g., Germany: 21%) are unlikely to account for much of this difference. A possible explanation (indicated in Fig 6) is that the less virulent strain(s) arriving from other parts of Asia may have had a head start in those countries, so that imported infections from Italy met subjects who had already developed (cross) resistance against both strains.\nThe parts of Europe not directly hit by the SKII strain leveled off at (about 40\/M\/d).

Of these, 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included for data extraction and critical appraisal. We identified three models to predict hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as a proxy for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models to detect COVID-19 infection in symptomatic individuals (13 of which were machine learning utilising computed tomography (CT) results); and ten prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to a severe state, or length of hospital stay.

All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and poor statistical analysis, including high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. A description of the study population and intended use of the models was absent in almost all reports, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed.\n Conclusion COVID-19 related prediction models are quickly entering the academic literature, to support medical decision making at a time where this is urgently needed. Our review indicates proposed models are poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Thus, their reported performance is likely optimistic and using them to support medical decision making is not advised. We call for immediate sharing of the individual participant data from COVID-19 studies to support collaborative efforts in building more rigorously developed prediction models and validating (evaluating) existing models. The aforementioned predictors identified in multiple included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. We also stress the need to follow methodological guidance when developing and validating prediction models, as unreliable predictions may cause more harm than benefit when used to guide clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD statement to facilitate validating, appraising, advocating and clinically using the reported models.","text_body":"Three models predicted the risk of hospital admission for COVID-19 pneumonia for individuals in the general population, but used admission due to non-tuberculosis pneumonia, influenza, acute bronchitis, or upper respiratory infections as outcomes in a dataset without any COVID-19 cases (see Table 1 ). 8 Among the predictors were age, sex, previous hospital admissions, comorbidity data, and social determinants of health.

Fifteen cases had a connection with Wuhan\/Hubei province or neighboring cities, while 21 had become infected via local transmission (3), or from friends\/family members in Shenyang already diagnosed with COVID-19.\nTo evaluate the implications of MTB infection history on the incidence and progression of COVID-19 disease, we addressed three questions. Does MTB co-infection: 1. increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection; 2. increase disease severity; and 3. lead to more rapid disease progression? We first assigned cases into two groups based on the severity of their COVID-19 pneumonia according to the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China (v6) 9 . Twenty-seven cases were mild\/moderate (75%, Group 1) and nine cases were severe\/critical (25%, Group 2) ( Table 2) . We then determined the MTB infection status of each patient by examining their clinical history and by performing X.DOT-TB IGRA assays (Table 1) To determine if MTB infection is a risk factor specific for COVID-19 pneumonia, or for pneumonia in general, we compared the MTB infection rate within these COVID-19 cases with data from a case-series comprised of 115 bacterial pneumonia and 62 viral pneumonia patients obtained from another study conducted in Shenyang (unpublished) ( Figure 1A ); MTB infection rates were considerably higher among COVID-19 patients than among bacterial pneumonia patients (36.11% vs 20%; p = 0.047 Figure 1A ) and viral pneumonia patients (36.11% vs 16.13%; p = 0.024),\nsuggesting that MTB infection status is a specific risk factor for SARS-COV-2 infection rather than for pneumonia in general.

We sought to explore the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff.\n In this retrospective study, 64 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb, 2020 were included. Two groups concerned were extracted from the subjects based on duration of symptoms: group 1 (\u226410 days) and group 2 (>10 days). Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed and compared across groups. The Kaplan-Meier plot was used to inspect the change in hospital discharge rate. The Cox regression model was utilized to identify factors associated with hospital discharge.\n The median age of medical staff included was 35 years old. 64% were female and 67% were nurses.

The research showed that 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%. 6 The number of patients in Wuhan and other regions is increasing rapidly. The current difficulty is the shortage of medical resources, especially critical care resources. If severe cases can be identified as early as possible, risk stratification management will help alleviate insufficient medical resources and might reduce mortality. No risk predictive model of severe illness about 2019-nCoV pneumonia has been published to date.\nMost of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia patients in the hospital were from Wuhan. Patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia on early onset were not very severe. The median time from onset to admission of severe patients and mild patients was similar, but the severe patients deteriorated on 7-14 days of illness course and developed to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. The severe or death patients with 2019-nCoV infection were mostly old age with comorbidities. 7 In the study, severe ill ones are all over 50 years old. The decrease of lymphocyte count was related to the progress of the disease. we proposed that blood lymphocyte related index may be a potential predictor. The NLR was a widely used marker for the assessment of the severity of bacterial infections and the prognosis of patients with pneumonia and tumors. The increase of NLR indicated poor clinical prognosis. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The results indicated that 2019-nCoV may act on T lymphocytes, and T lymphocyte damage is an important factor that causes patients to deteriorate 13 . In addition, patients with severe illness might have bacterial infection due to low immune function. The latest report followed up the laboratory test results of patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and found that 5 patients had a rising neutrophil count and a falling lymphocyte count before their deaths. 6 In the study, the data of 61 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia were analyzed, the baseline characteristics of patients in the mild and severe groups were described and compared, and the dynamic changes of laboratory indexes and imaging were demonstrated. The independent risk factors affecting incidence of severe illness were screened. The results showed that NLR was the most significant factor affecting the severe illness incidence, and it had significant predictive value. Furthermore, according to the NLR and age stratification, the incidence of severe ill ones with NLR \u2265 3.13 and aged \u2265 50 years old was 50%, and 9.1% in age \u2265 50 and NLR < 3.13 patients.\nPrevious studies showed that the MuLBSTA score can early warn the mortality of viral pneumonia, which included six indicators, such as age, smoking history, hypertension, bacterial co-infection, lymphopenia, and multilobular infiltration. 15 CURB-65 score was widely used to evaluate 30-day mortality of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. [16] [17] [18] In the study, NLR was compared with MuLBSTA and CURB-65 scoring models, the results showed that NLR had higher AUC, c-index, sensitivity and specificity, which indicated that NLR was better than the other two models in early predicting the incidence of severe illness. Furthermore, it was found that the prediction effect of the NLR-MuLBSTA and NLR-CURB-65 models was better than that of the original model. But NLR was an easy-to-use predictor index.\nBased on the results, we suggest that patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia can improve risk stratification and management according to NLR and age model.

If there are large-scale cases, the risk stratification and management will help alleviate the shortage of medical resources and reduce the mortality of critical patients.\nThere were some limitations in the study. First, the study was a single center with small sample and no external validation cohort. Second, most of patients are still in hospital, whose condition maybe change in follow-up. And the study has not included the final survival outcome. However, we focused on the early identification of critical cases for risk stratification and management. We expect that the risk model can help alleviate the shortage of medical resources and manage the patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia.","publish_time_x":"2020-02-12","authors_x":"Jingyuan Liu; Yao Liu; Pan Xiang; Lin Pu; Haofeng Xiong; Chuansheng Li; Ming Zhang; Jianbo Tan; Yanli Xu; Rui Song; Meihua Song; Lin Wang; Wei Zhang; Bing Han; Li Yang; Xiaojing Wang; Guiqin Zhou; Ting Zhang; Ben Li; Yanbin Wang; Zhihai Chen; Xianbo Wang","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.02.10.20021584","H index_x":null,"section":"Discussion","total_rank":0.0711252654,"risk_factors":["smoking"],"match_indices":[2895],"smoking_count":1,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],["surviv"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["model","model","model","model","model","model","model"],["outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk"],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["factor","factor","factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"151878038cf26f6f2b2ec8a391e6c4d425211ca5","title_x":"ACE2 and TMPRSS2 variants and expression as candidates to sex and country differences in COVID-19 severity in Italy","abstract_x":"As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 progresses, prognostic markers for early identification of high-risk individuals are an urgent medical need.\n Italy has the highest rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the highest number of deaths, and the highest mortality rate among large countries. Worldwide, a more severe course of COVID-19 is associated with older age, comorbidities, and male sex. Hence, we searched for possible genetic components of the peculiar severity of COVID-19 among Italians, by looking at expression levels and variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, which are crucial for viral infection.\n Exome and SNP array data from a large Italian cohort representative of the country's population were used to compare the burden of rare variants and the frequency of polymorphisms with European and East Asian populations.\n Moreover, we looked into gene expression databases to check for sexunbalanced expression.","text_body":"For most X-chromosome genes, the double allelic dosage in women is balanced by the epigenetic silencing of one of the X chromosomes in early development. 15 However, the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is incomplete in humans and up to one third of genes are expressed from both alleles, with the degree of XCI escape varying between genes and individuals. 16 ACE2 is one of the genes escaping X inactivation, but it belongs to a subgroup of X-chromosome genes escaping XCI showing an uncharacteristically heterogeneous pattern of male-female expression, with higher expression in men in several tissues. 17 Specifically concerning the lung, a recent analysis on published expression data, reported a substantial similar level of ACE2 transcript in men and women, 18 however, another study, using single-cell sequencing, found a higher expression of ACE2 in Asian men. 19 Supplementary Figure 1 reports data on ACE2 mRNA expression levels in the lung as retrieved from the largest datasets available in the literature; no substantial differences were found between males and females, nor between younger and older women, thus confirming what already observed by Cai and colleagues. 18 Another possible sex-related effect might be due to the fact that males are hemizygous for the gene, therefore, in the presence of an ACE2 allelic variant increasing disease susceptibility or severity, men will have all cells expressing the risk variant. Based on this hypothesis, we looked into the genetic variation in ACE2.\nA recent manuscript explored this same topic in different populations using data from public databases. 20 However, a specific analysis of the Italian population is Iacking.\nWe have therefore exploited the available data on 3,984 exomes obtained from an Italian cohort representative of the whole country 12, 13 to extract the variants in exons and splice junctions of ACE2.

Initial clinical features at disease onset are fever (77-98%), dry cough (46-82%), myalgia or fatigue (11-52%) and dyspnea (3-31%) . 3 The majority of patients develop pneumonia, which can proceed in up to 20-30% of cases to respiratory failure requiring intubation and ventilatory support. In those COVID-19 patients who go on to develop pneumonia, dyspnea develops a median of 8 days after onset of illness. Radiographic abnormalities (CT or chest x-ray) consisting of ground-glass opacities and focal consolidation are seen in patients with pneumonia. Major causes of death include respiratory failure and myocardial damage due to myocarditis. Acute kidney injury, secondary infection and coagulopathy are each seen in approximately 50% of non-survivors. Mortality increases with age and in patients with underlying co-morbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, chronic lung disease, and cancer. According to a recent retrospective report from Wuhan, clinical predictors of increased mortality on multivariate analysis included advanced age, progressive organ failure and elevated D-Dimers on admission. 4 Other factors significantly associated with poor outcome on univariate analysis included elevated levels of serum ferritin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), Alanine amino transferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and highly sensitive cardiac Troponin I, as well as reduced levels of lymphocytes, Hemoglobin (Hb), Platelets and serum albumin.\nThe best recognized hematologic abnormality is lymphopenia, which is seen in up to 85% of severe cases with the severity of lymphopenia linked to outcome. 5 Since regulatory T cells play an important role in dampening the immune response, excessive elimination of these cells could result in an unchecked innate immune responses, leading to an uncontrolled inflammatory response. 5 Indeed, there is growing evidence implicating excessive monocyte\/macrophage activation and associated cytokine storm with the pathophysiology of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease related complications. 6 Despite this, there are few reports to date relating to abnormalities of monocytes in patients with COVID-19. Herein we describe novel observations in relation to changes in monocyte morphology and activation status, which correlate with the prognosis and severity of COVID-19 infection and which can be readily quantified by flow cytometry with the concurrent measurement of forward scatter (FSC) and (SSC), which measure cell size and complexity, respectively. Specifically, we have identified the presence of a population of monocytes with higher FSC than normal (FSC-high) not typically seen in other types of viral infection.\nFurther analysis reveals that these FSC-high monocytes express CD14, CD11b, as well as CD16 along with markers associated with both M1 and M2 polarization, and secrete IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-26","authors_x":"Dan Zhang; Rui Guo; Lei Lei; Hongjuan Liu; Yawen Wang; Yili Wang; Tongxin Dai; Tianxiao Zhang; Yanjun Lai; Jingya Wang; Zhiqiang Liu; Aili He; Michael O'Dwyer; Jinsong Hu","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042655","H index_x":null,"section":"Introduction","total_rank":0.1124161074,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[1450],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],["surviv"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["analysi","analysi","analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age","age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"6fa1537d3cad42c332a707aa76b62a4d6d5e8736","title_x":"COVID-19 infection induces readily detectable morphological and inflammation-related phenotypic changes in peripheral blood monocytes, the severity of which correlate with patient outcome","abstract_x":"Background: Excessive monocyte\/macrophage activation with the development of a cytokine storm and subsequent acute lung injury, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a feared consequence of infection with COVID-19.

For treatment, the elevated PCT seen in children in contrast to adults suggests that the underlying coinfection\/secondary infection may be more common in pediatric patients and appropriate antibacterial treatment should be considered. Once cytokine storm is found in these patients, anti-autoimmune or blood-purifying therapy should be given in time. Furthermore, effective isolation measures and appropriate psychological comfort need to be provided timely.","text_body":"To our best knowledge on COVID-19, among the patients confirmed with COVID-19, the population of pediatric patients is rather small [4] . The children confirmed with COVID-19 mostly have good prognosis. A single child patient passed away; for other child patients, progression of the disease was observed as mild [9, 10] . Yet, in more general, infectious diseases often tend to behave less aggressively in child patients. For severe respiratory distress syndrome (SARS), the total death ratio is reported within 7% to 17%. For individuals with less than 24 years of age, the death ratio is 0% compared to 50% mortality rates in adults older than 65 years [9] . Looking at those cases of COVID-19 judged as severe, children's rate is also considerably below adults' rate (49.0%, 1023\/2087) [19] . The main explanation would be:1. One possible reason is that children have been protected well resulting in lower potential exposure with the virus due to considerably lower travelling track record and potentially relatively higher indoor time. 2. Children possess more active innate immune systems, including mostly fully functional lungs owing to low exposure to smoking induced and other air pollution. 3. Children do not really have complex underlying disorders. 4.The differences in distribution, maturation and function of viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) are usually named a potential cause for age-based differences in infection rate. ACE2 was already considered a cell receptor for SARS-CoV [9] . Recent reports indicate that ACE2 in ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes is also likely the binding receptor for SARS-CoV-2. A usual theory for children's lower sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 is based on their less maturity and lower function of ACE2 compared with that in adults [9] .\nNevertheless, the children, especially infants, who are confirmed with COVID-19 could be an insidious infectious source because of their asymptomatic or mild symptomatic infection due to a weak immune system or their own physical characteristics. A largely asymptomatic infant with COVID-19 with high viral load was reported in Singapore, and this case highlights the difficulties in establishing the true incidence of COVID-19, as asymptomatic individuals may play important roles in human-to-human transmission in the community [13] . A study focused on 24 asymptomatic infections identified that the infection period of asymptomatic patients may be as long as three weeks, and the infected patients may develop into serious diseases [14] . Furthermore, the bad habits of young children such as sucking hands, putting their hands all around and unwilling to wash hands could be important risk factors in contact transmission for children. Thus, it is necessary to guarantee family daily prevention to keep children from COVID-19 infection and assure awareness of the importance of its early diagnosis. Also, during the epidemic period, children's health clinics and vaccination clinics should be reduced reasonably, and parent-child activities, kindergartens, primary schools, and other group activities related to children should be suspended. In clinical case, screening was mostly based on the epidemiological track record. Additional basis were raised body temperature and symptoms of the respiratory tract. For children, it is more important to trace close contact history, and pathogen examination needs to be timely executed along with longitudinal monitoring through viral nucleic acid detection. Further isolation recommendations and ongoing nucleic acid testing are also recommended for discharged patients [14] . Additionally, it appears crucial to follow up with infants'respiratory as well as gastrointestinal symptoms and vital indications steadily, which is the most susceptible population in children, at mild onset that could progress into severe at a later stage [11] .\nMoreover, for screening the suspected cases, since \"most of the pediatric patients are mild cases, plain chest X-ray often fails to show the lesions or the detailed features, leading to misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis\" [4, 8, 16] . As a consequence, chest CT early on is seen mandatory.\nAlso, a number of suspected pediatric patients with a negative nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 virus were rightfuly considered potential infection cases in accordance with usual chest CT visible lesions. This further encourages early diagnosis and treatment, but also isolating of infected children in effective ways [8] .\nIn a recent report, the authors studied the CT features of 20 children, and came to the conclusion that consolidation with surrounding halo signs are frequent in children with COVID-19. Interestingly, these are dissimilar from those of grown-ups. One may assume such consolidation with surrounding halo signs as a distinctive feature of young individuals affected [8] . Another study reported the CT results of 3 children with positive COVID-19 diagnosis which showed patchy ground-glass opacities that were similar, but more modest compared to reports in adults [18] .However, the samples of both studies are indeed small, in the future, large-scale studies focusing on the imaging features of children with COVID-19 are needed.\nFurthermore, the data from the first group also showed that the PCT has significantly increased in 80% of the cases in this study with or without coinfection evidence existing, which is not common in adult patients [8] . This suggests that the underlying coinfection or secondary infection may be more common in pediatric patients. If a secondary infection\/coinfection is suspected, a collection of the specimen should be executed to detect potential secondary bacterial and\/or fungal infections, and routine antibacterial treatment also should be considered in this situation [2, 8] .\nIn 2017, a large-scale retrospective research focusing on epidemiology as well as on clinical attributes of HCoVs (HKU1, 229E, OC43, and NL63) in the pediatric population (261 cases) showed the risks linked to aggravation of infection. The risk factors were: younger than two years of age and in addition cardiovascular, genetic or congenital and respiratory chronic complex conditions which in the context of requiring respiratory support. Genetic or congenital underlying disorders were associated with PICU admission [17] . For those critical pediatric patients with positive COVID-19 diagnosis, the most frequently observed symptoms were polypnea, then fever, and finally coughing [19] .\nSome severe or critical children were found to have an excessive active immune response, which may result in long-term lung injury as well as fatal health problems. Coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and MERS were proved to have the potential ability to lead to significant and peculiar destructive host immune response that is related to severe lung damage. Researches exhibited the lung impairment is mostly observed in patients in a critical state, linked to a cytokine storm, marked by raised levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, TNF, IFN-\u03b3), as well as of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, TGF-\u03b2) [12, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .\nThese findings suggest that it is necessary to detect the indicator of the inflammatory and immune status, which could help doctors to assess the clinical progress, be on alert for severe and critical cases, and provide anti-autoimmune or blood-purifying therapy in time, once cytokine storm occurs [2, 19] .\nEarly identification and diagnosis of the severe\/critical pediatric patients are always the priority to result in appropriate treatment and good prognosis.\nIn the latest version of \"Scheme for Diagnosis and Treatment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia\", pediatric patients with \" fast respiratory rate and\/or; lethargy and drowsiness mental state and\/or; lactate progressively increasing and\/or; imaging showed bilateral or multi lobed infiltration, pleural effusion or rapidly expending of lesions in a short period of time and\/or; less than 3 months old or those which underly diseases (congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respiratory tract deformity, abnormal hemoglobin, severe malnutrition, etc.) and\/or, immune deficiency\/hypofunction (long-term use of immunosuppressant drugs)\", are in high risk progressing into severe to critical illness, and intravenous immunoglobulin may be considered in those children [2] .\nFor those children isolated alone from their parents, maternal separation may cause anxiety and depression to infants or children. For this reason, their psychological caretaking for their wellbeing needs to be assured. All of the treatment plan and segregation situation have to be discussed with the responsible care-takers of the young individuals. Psychologists or suited related experts are required to help cease their anxiety and panic.\nIn conclusion, the numbers of children with COVID-19 pneumonia infection are small, and most of them come from family aggregation. Symptoms are mainly mild or even asymptomatic which allow children to be a risk factor for transmission. Thus, strict epidemiological history screening is needed for early diagnosis and segregation. This holds especially for infants, who are more susceptible to infection than other age groups in pediatric age, but have most likely subtle and unspecific symptoms. They need to be paid more attention to. CT examination is a necessity for screening the suspected cases, because the majority of the young COVID-19 infected are classified as mild infection, and plain chest X-ray mostly gives not sufficient insight into the lesions or lung details. Therefore, early chest CT examination combined with pathogenic recognition is a recommended clinical diagnosis scheme in children. The risk factors which may suggest severe or critical progress for children are: Fast respiratory rate and\/or; lethargy and drowsiness mental state and\/or; lactate progressively increasing and\/or; imaging showed bi-or multi-lobed infiltration, pleural effusion, or rapidly expending of lesions in a short period of time and\/or; less than 3 months old or those who underly diseases. For those critical pediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, polypnea may be the most common symptom. For treatment, the elevated PCT seen in children in contrast to adults suggests that the underlying coinfection\/secondary infection may be more common in pediatric patients and appropriate antibacterial treatment should be considered. Once cytokine storm is found in these patients, anti-autoimmune or bloodpurifying therapy should be given in time. Finally, it is of crucial importance to assure early isolation combined with best possible psychological support for the young patients.","publish_time_x":"2020-04-04","authors_x":"Xiao Li; Kun Qian; Ling-ling Xie; Xiu-juan Li; Min Cheng; Li Jiang; Bjoern W.

More than 50 countries have declared a state of emergency, and some countries have even declared a state of \"war\". As of March 21, 2020, a total 266,073 patients of COVID-19 have been diagnosed in the world 1 . The clinical manifestations of SARS-Cov-2 infection range from asymptomatic (no symptoms) mild to severe organ dysfunction such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to death [2] [3] [4] . The common symptoms including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia, and lymphopenia in infected patients. The typical abnormality of CT scan was bilateral distribution of patchy shadows and ground-glass opacity 5 . A study has reported that the pathological features of COVID-19 greatly are similar with those seen in SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection, such as the bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, pulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane formation 6 .\nAs a member of the coronavirus family, SARS-CoV-2 is now spread human-to-human with higher infectivity than MERS and SARS but a lower fatality rate 7 . COVID-19 is highly transmissible disease via respiratory droplets, aerosols and close contact. Parturients were considered to be susceptible of SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 can threaten to the health of maternal and infant. Although the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnant women are similar with non-pregnant females, COVID-19 resulted in additional challenges for obstetric anaesthesia under cesarean delivery as reported in our previous study 8 . However, the comparison between parturients undergoing cesarean delivery with versus without COVID-19 are still undefined and the clinical features of parturients with COVID-19 require further investigation. In present study, we retrospectively analyzed and compared the anaesthetic data and outcomes for parturients with or without COVID-19 in multicentre during and after cesarean delivery.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-27","authors_x":"Yuan Zhang; Rong Chen; Jie Wang; Yuan Gong; Qin Zhou; Hui-hui Cheng; Zhong-yuan Xia; Xiangdong Chen; Qing-tao Meng; Daqing Ma","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042176","H index_x":null,"section":"Introduction","total_rank":0.1926345609,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[1539,1575],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":2,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["investigati"],[],["outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],["range"],[],["asymptomatic"],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age"],[],[],["health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"7c8152250ebc8a8b31066de90c3bdaebc076365b","title_x":"Anaesthetic managment and clinical outcomes of parturients with COVID-19: a multicentre, retrospective, propensity score matched cohort study Short Title: Obstetric anaesthesia for parturients with COVID-19","abstract_x":"Objective: To analyse the clinical features of COVID-19 parturients, and to compare anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes in parturients with or without COVID-19 undergoing cesarean delivery.\n Methods: Data were extracted from the electronic medical record of 3 medical institutions in Hubei Province, China, from June 1, 2019 to March 20, 2020 according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The objective of this study was to analyze the association between lymphocyte reduction at early stage and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.\n All 192 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Electronic medical records, including demographic data, clinical characteristics, comorbidities and exposure history, were collected. Biochemical indexes on admission and chest computed tomography (CT) were detected. Patient's prognosis was followed up.\n Results: On admission, 84 (43.8%) patients suffered from lymphocyte reduction among COVID-19 patients. The count and percentage of lymphocytes on admission were lower among more than seventy-year-old patients than those of younger patients.\n Multivariate logistic regression revealed that older age was a risk factor of lymphocyte reduction.

By contrast, PaCO2, SpO2 and oxygenation index, several respiratory function markers, were decreased in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Moreover, TBIL and DBIL, two markers of hepatic injury, creatinine and urea nitrogen, two indices of renal function, and creatine kinase, AST and LDH, three myocardial enzymes, were elevated in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction.

This is of great importance for early quarantine for the subjects with emerging infectious disease when specific treatments are not available.\nActually, we have learned from the SARS outbreak 17 years ago that early identification, early isolation and early management would lead to the stop of viral transmissions from human to human 79 . Collectively, there were 36% of the COVID-19 patients absent from fever as the onset symptom. In this case, such patients may have been ignored at the early stage if we focused heavily on fever examination for initial screening. Our composite analysis showed that fever remains the most common symptom (83.0%) in patients with COVID-19. However, the proportion of fever is somewhat lower than that of other coronavirus related respiratory illness, such as SARS (100%) 80 81 or middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) (98%) 82 . Similarly, the accompanied symptoms of dyspnea (14.5%) and diarrhea (6.1%) are relatively less common in patients with COVID-19 than those seen in SARS and MERS 87 .

Nevertheless, the CFR of COVID-19 was much lower than that of SARS (9.6%) 83 and MERS (37.1%) 84 . By far, the mechanisms underlying the varying symptoms and CFR for these three coronavirus-infected diseases are not fully understood. One reason may be that there were still some COVID-19 patients being treated in hospitals at the time of the manuscripts submitted, so the outcome (death or recovery) is not known yet.\nAdditionally, we suppose that the varied tropism as well as virulence of these three coronaviruses may in part account for the discrepancies, which warrants further investigations.\nAccording to the seven version Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel All rights reserved.

We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government' public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. Except for slightly lower compliance among young adults, all subgroups we studied understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government , or think the government has been untruthful about the crisis believe the messaging and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Communications should move from explaining to citizens that they should stay at home to what they can do there. We need interventions that make staying following public health protocols more desirable, such as virtual social interactions, online social reading activities, classes, exercise routines, etc. -all designed to reduce the boredom of long term social isolation and to increase the attractiveness of following public health recommendations. Interventions like these will grow in importance as the crisis wears on around the world, and staying inside wears on people. 1 Roma Capitale (Municipality of Rome) convened our \"COVID-19 International Behavioral Science Working Group\" to (i) strengthen its public health policies and guidance, (ii) suggest new policies and guidance based on rigorous behavioral science, and (iii) develop empirical evidence about behavioral change. We report here empirical results and policy interventions aimed at achieving the objectives of the national Italian Government concerning the containment of the pandemic.

The first figure in each pair gives overall results, and the second is broken down by demographic group.\nWhat does the Italian public believe about recommended health measures regarding the COVID-19 crisis? Figure 1 shows that our subjects are appropriately cautious: nearly 100% endorse four recommended public health measures (handshake avoidance, social gathering avoidance, non-essential activities curfew, and non-essential shop closure). Of the four, the curfew and shop closure are slightly less popular, but an 89% endorsement rate is still remarkable. Compared with decades of advice to reduce smoking, drinking, and lack of exercise, these levels are very high. All demographic groups strongly agree with these four measures, though there is consistent (small) disagreement amongst respondents reporting that they are in \"excellent\" health ( Figure 2 ). When asked to reflect in writing about the social costs of reneging on the quarantine, nearly all respondents express agreement and emphasize collective responsibility. A representative (open text) reflection from the entire respondent sample reads : 3 \"I believe that EVERYONE should stay at home, leaving only for the bare minimum and taking security measures. Only in this way can we solve and solve this enormous problem in the shortest possible time.\"\nWe note that older respondents (1) consistently express worry or anxiety and (2) perceive that others in the public are reneging on their duty. A representative reflection from the 60+ subgroup reads : 4 \"I fully understand everything that is happening, so in spite of myself, I stay at home, but I would like this to include all those people who unfortunately continue to go out, especially the young, even every day! I think the longer we stay home, the sooner we get out!\"\nWe turn from respondents' beliefs to their actual behavior. Figure 3 shows that a majority of respondents report that they have been strongly complying with recommended health practices.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-30","authors_x":"Soubhik Barari; Stefano Caria; Antonio Davola; Paolo Falco; Thiemo Fetzer; Stefano Fiorin; Lukas Hensel; Andriy Ivchenko; Jon Jachimowicz; Gary King; Gordon Kraft-Todd; Alice Ledda; Mary MacLennan; Lucian Mutoi; Claudio Pagani; Elena Reutskaja; Federico Raimondi Slepoi","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20042820","H index_x":null,"section":"Most demographic groups, especially the elderly, believe in and follow health measures","total_rank":0.1696202532,"risk_factors":["smoking"],"match_indices":[774],"smoking_count":1,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["health","health","health","health","health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"af7d038be406d73b373f05a9cdfaf62d98e26cbb","title_x":"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada","abstract_x":"We evaluated how non-pharmaceutical interventions could be used to control the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the burden on the healthcare system.\n Using an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada, we compared a base case with limited testing, isolation, and quarantine to scenarios with: enhanced case finding; restrictive social distancing measures; or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive social distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected ICU bed occupancy. We present median and credible intervals (CrI) from 100 replicates per scenario using a two-year time horizon.\n We estimated that 56% (95% CrI: 42-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107,000 (95% CrI: 60,760-149,000) cases in hospital and 55,500 (95% CrI: 32,700-75,200) cases in ICU. For fixed duration scenarios, all interventions were projected to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to the base case, with restrictive social distancing estimated to have the greatest effect. Longer duration interventions were more effective. Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce the proportion of the population infected at the end of the two-year period. Dynamic social distancing interventions could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontario's ICU capacity.\n Interpretation: Without significant social distancing or a combination of moderate social distancing with enhanced case finding, we project that ICU resources would be overwhelmed. Dynamic social distancing could maintain health system capacity and also allow periodic psychological and economic respite for populations.","text_body":"The model was stratified by 5-year age groups using 2019 population estimates (14) .

It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there is a need for detailed high-resolution analysis of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. We provide national-and county-level simulations of school closures and absenteeism across the United States. At the national level, we estimate the projected absenteeism rate to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 172 to 218 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected absenteeism and school closure effects, ranging from 2.0% to 18.6% absenteeism and 88 to 280 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. We also find significant associations between levels of absenteeism and COVID-19 complication factors. We observe from our models that an estimated 98.8% of counties would find it less expensive to provide child care to all healthcare workers with children than to bear the costs of healthcare worker absenteeism during school closures, identifying child care subsidization as a potential solution to help maintain healthcare systems during a pandemic.","text_body":"School closures are a common measure of pandemic mitigation for many countries, driven by the logic that social distancing reduces transmission. [1] [2] [3] Although school closures are known to reduce transmission, previous works have suggested that school closures could have downstream consequences on the healthcare system such as healthcare worker absenteeism. 4, 5 However, lack of granular, high-resolution data has restrained previous studies to providing estimates based on national data with strong assumptions, underscoring the need for more detailed analysis. 3 Newly available demographic and occupational data from the American Community Survey permits county-level scenario analyses of school closures with respect to healthcare worker absenteeism across the United States for the first time.\nIn the absence of a federal mandate for school closures, the decision of whether or not to close a school is determined by local authorities. The needs and capabilities of both schools and healthcare systems vary drastically across the United States, so county-level simulations of healthcare worker absenteeism and school closures could be far more impactful and targeted for local communities than state or national-level simulations. China's CDC reports that patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes had higher rates of fatality from COVID-19 (0.9% case fatality with no reported comorbidities, 10.5% and 7.3% for comorbidities of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, respectively). 6 The prevalence of these comorbidities also varies geographically in the US, further highlighting the importance of regional analysis. [7] [8] [9] To maintain healthcare systems in the event of a school closure, it could be beneficial to assist healthcare workers with child care. Previous work has shown that increased wages are associated with lower absenteeism, so it is possible that child care subsidies could reduce absenteeism by alleviating the financial burden of child care for healthcare workers as well as further incentivizing them to remain at work. 10, 11 Furthermore, the costs of child care (which is the main barrier to finding child care) and the salaries of healthcare workers vary regionally, so the necessity of child care subsidization for healthcare workers could also vary regionally. 12 Here, we provide county-level microsimulation analyses on the potential effects of COVID-19 school closures on healthcare worker absenteeism and hospital bed demand across the entirety of the United States over a range of plausible scenarios. We estimate projected healthcare worker absenteeism, county-level associations between absenteeism and severe COVID-19 risk factors, and the effectiveness of school closures on reducing hospital bed demand; we also identify child care subsidies as a potential solution to help maintain healthcare systems during a pandemic.

Our transmission models projected reduced hospitalizations from school closures, but it is highly likely that hospitalizations and ICU bed demand would still far exceed bed capacity for many hospitals. 25 Furthermore, our models estimated generally high absenteeism rates (> 7%) across different assumptions, highlighting the need for reducing absenteeism in the event of school closures. Our regression analysis estimated that counties that are already vulnerable to COVID-19 complications due to diabetes prevalence would also have higher rates of absenteeism from school closures, illustrating an exacerbated scenario in the absence of adequate child care.\nTo identify a potential approach to reducing absenteeism, we estimated that the vast majority of counties (> 98%) could save money by providing child care to their healthcare workers with children in the event of a school closure (\u03c9 > 1). Although it is likely that many child care avenues would also be closed in the event of school closures, subsidized child care costs could still prevent absenteeism by (1) incentivizing work attendance with extra wages, and (2) alleviating the financial burden on the entire household, enabling other family or household members to participate in child care.\nOur findings contribute to the literature of school closures during pandemics by providing county-level estimates of absenteeism and school closure effectiveness, relating those estimates to county-level COVID-19 complication factors, and providing an economic analysis of child care subsidies. In previous works, Sadique et al and Lempel et al provided national level cost analyses of school closures under a variety of model assumptions and closure lengths. 4, 5 In a recent preprint, Bayham and Fenichel provide state-level estimates and include a tradeoff analysis on whether closing schools reduces mortality after accounting for disruption to healthcare systems from absenteeism.

Characteristics were compared between patients who died or recovered, and between patients with different disease severity.\n Results By Feb 25, 2020, 403 patients were enrolled, 100 died and 303 recovered. Most of non-survivors tended to be males, old aged, or with chronic diseases. Duration from illness onset to admission was 9 (7-12) days. Patients with severe or critical illness had more days from onset to admission compared to those with ordinary illness. Lymphopenia, anemia, hypoproteinemia, and abnormal serum sodium were presented in 52.6%, 54.6%, 69.8%, and 21.8% cases, respectively.\n Patients who died or with severe\/critical illness showed increased white blood cell and neutrophil count, serum total bilirubin, creatinine, hypersensitive troponin I, D-dimer, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein, and decreased red blood cell, lymphocyte, platelet count, and serum albumin on admission compared to those who recovered or with ordinary illness.

The Bacille Calmette Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine has previously been shown to have non-specific protective effects on infections, as well as longterm efficacy against tuberculosis. Using publicly available data we built a simple log-linear regression model to assess the association of BCG use and COVID-19-attributable mortality per 1 million population after adjusting for confounders including country economic status (GDP per capita), and proportion of elderly among the population. The timing of country entry into the pandemic epidemiological trajectory was aligned by plotting time since the 100 th reported case. Countries with economies classified as lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income and highincome countries (LMIC, UMIC, HIC) had median crude COVID-19 log-mortality of 0.4 (Interquartile Range (IQR) 0.1, 0.4), 0.7 (IQR 0.2, 2.2) and 5.5 (IQR 1.6, 13.9), respectively. COVID-19-attributable mortality among BCG-using countries was 5.8 times lower [95% CI 1.8-19.0] than in non BCG-using countries. Notwithstanding limitations due to testing constraints in LMICs, case ascertainment bias and a plausible rise of cases as countries progress along the epidemiological trajectory, these analyses provide intriguing observations that urgently warrant mobilization of resources for prospective randomized interventional studies and institution of systematic disease surveillance, particularly in LMICs.","text_body":"Novel SARS-CoV2 continues to wreak global havoc. Mortality is of greatest concern directly influencing national response and policy. Early reports from Hubei province in China reported a case fatality rate (CFR) of 15% 1 , which with widening surveillance, rapidly decreased to below 3% 2,3 . As new epidemics began in other countries, early testing strategies focused only on severe cases or contacts of known cases and those with known international travel, leading to positively biased CFR estimates. A high CFR of 7.2% reported in Italy was attributed to a greater proportion of the elderly in the population and a stringent testing strategy restricted to severe disease cases 4 . With concurrent outbreaks occurring globally, marked discrepancies in CFR became increasingly apparent. In east Asian countries (Vietnam, Thailand, and Philippines), early rises in case incidence have not been followed by similarly sharp CFR increases. CFR estimation is sensitive to testing strategies, initiation of distancing measures, access to healthcare and population age structure. We surmised that since susceptibility to COVID-19 infection extends to the entire population, crude national COVID-19-specific mortality within the country-specific population would be an informative outcome indicator to study differences in mortality patterns amongst countries, in addition to a priori defined potential exposure variables including BCG vaccine use in national immunization schedules.\nAmong vaccination strategies worldwide, Bacille Calmette Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine has the widest use and is accompanied by a strong safety profile. It is given in infancy for prevention of severe forms of tuberculosis. Epidemiological and randomized trial evidence suggest a protective effect of BCG on infant mortality via nonspecific heterologous protection against other infections 5 possibly through innate immune epigenetic mechanisms 6, 7 . BCG lowers experimental viremia in adult human volunteers through upregulation of interleukins such as IL-1\u03b2 8 . In a randomized placebo-controlled trial in Indonesia, BCG given monthly consecutively for 3 months significantly reduced incidence of acute upper respiratory infections among individuals aged >65years 9 . In a trial among Native Americans, BCG vaccination given during childhood showed efficacy in preventing tuberculosis up to 60 years after vaccination, indicating the durability of its protection 10 . Demonstration that exposure to BCG vaccination can ameliorate severe COVID-19 disease and lower mortality could rationalize a therapeutic or preventive strategy that can have immediately deployable global impact. Therefore, using existing publicly available data we examined at the ecological level whether country-level COVID-19 mortality was associated with BCG use in national immunization schedules.\n.

Whilst dyspnoea is not a particularly common symptom in COVID-19 patients, its significant association with both severe disease and ICU admission may help discriminate between severe and non-severe COVID-19\ncases, when present.\nThe findings reported here are in keeping with current knowledge that the elderly and those with comorbidities are more susceptible to severe infection. those with: cardiovascular disease (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory disease (6.3%) and hypertension (6.0%) (19) . Unlike the China CDC study (19) that presented case fatality rates for different groups, our findings compare those with particular comorbidities to those without, allowing us to estimate the effect of a particular comorbidity on COVID-19 severity. Although we did not investigate death (and included COPD rather than chronic respiratory disease), our analysis similarly suggests that comorbidities are not uniform in terms of the risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Despite being uncommon in our study population, COPD was by far the strongest risk factor for COVID-19 severity, followed by CVD and hypertension.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-16","authors_x":"Vageesh Jain; Jin-Min Yuan","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.15.20035360","H index_x":null,"section":"Meta-analysis","total_rank":0.1456102784,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[426,1878],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":2,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["analysi","analysi","analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["meta-analysis"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk"],[],[],[],["infecti"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"e1bd6ce36d65c253f39712d702a10c962bc3282b","title_x":"Association of BCG vaccination policy with prevalence and mortality of COVID-19","abstract_x":"There is some evidence that tuberculosis vaccine bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) has non-specific beneficial effects against non-related infections. Here, we examined the possible association between BCG vaccination with prevalence and mortality by COVID-19 by using publicly available data of countries\/regions and the BCG World Atlas. By using linear regression modeling, we found that the number of total cases and deaths per one million population were significantly associated with the country's policy concerning BCG vaccine administration. The amount of variance in cases and deaths explained by BCG vaccination policy ranged between 12.5% and 38%. Importantly, this effect remained significant after controlling for the country's life expectancy and the average temperature in February and March 2020, which themselves are significantly correlated with the cases and deaths indices, respectively. By contrast, the ratio between deaths and cases was weakly affected. This latter outcome suggested that BCG vaccination may have hindered the overall spread of the virus or progression of the disease rather than reducing mortality rates (i.e., deaths\/cases ratio). Finally, by roughly dividing countries into three categories showing high, middle, or low growth rate of the cases, we found a highly significant difference between the slope categories among the BCG groups, suggesting that the time since the onset of the spread of the virus was not a major confounding factor.","text_body":"We are still in the midst of the pandemic, during which the virus keeps spreading in most of the countries (except for China, where the rise has nearly been stopped).\nAlso, the role of the observed between-country differences concerning the date of the spread of the COVID-19 is still unclear.

Some of these elements might affect the observed relationships between COVID-19 indices and BCG vaccination policy by affecting both the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and BCG vaccination policy in an indirect manner. These and other factors need to be examined in future studies (or even before formal publication of this manuscript in a journal with peer review; see \"production note\" below).\nAs outlined above, we have employed a rough classification for the statistical test for the relationship between BCG groups and the growth curve of COVID-19 in each country with a limited number of observations ( Figure 3a) . Obviously, it would be preferable to use continuous data to produce a more accurate estimation of the impact of BCG vaccination policy on how quickly the virus spreads.\nAlso, examining variables such as BCG strain 26 and the timing and the number of vaccinations (including the ones for other diseases) would be worth some attention.\nThese variables might be easier to be examined in those countries where mandatory BCG vaccination was terminated by investigating the history of vaccination of COVID-19 patients and their symptoms and condition severity.\nIn our study, we used the data that are publicly available from several websites (see Method and results section), which have not been validated by any official institutions (to the best of our knowledge).

As of April 5, 2020, more than 1.2 million cases have been confirmed and ~70,000 deaths have been reported in ~180 countries. 1 Several studies have rapidly provided crucial data (e.g., incubation period) related to various aspects of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 : severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection. 2 However, risk factors for the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 are poorly understood. Such information is critical to identify high risk patients and to facilitate planning (e.g., forecasting the need for hospital beds and mechanical ventilators). These risk factors will also have implications for workforce allocation (e.g., assignment of healthcare providers with specific risk factors to positions with reduced risk of exposure to .\nTo date, several studies have reported that a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and traditional CVD risk factors, e.g., age, male sex, current smoking, hypertension, and diabetes, are associated with severe COVID-19. However, other than age, results have been inconsistent. Furthermore, few studies accounted for potential confounding by age and sex when they evaluated other potential risk factors. For example, some studies reported that hypertension is a risk factor of severe COVID-19, but their observations may simply reflect the fact that hypertension is more common in older adults. 3 Nonetheless, despite the lack of robust evidence, this observation, together with the fact SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as an entry to human body, 4 has raised a concern about continued use of reninangiotensin system increase among some clinicians and researchers. 5, 6 In this context, we conducted a systematic review of studies reporting cardiovascular risk factors and their relation to severe manifestation of COVID-19 (i.e., death, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] , the need of mechanical ventilator support, and admission to an intensive care unit [ICU]), with a particular interest on studies that adjusted for key confounders such as age and sex.\n.

We searched PubMed and Embase for papers in English with original data (\u226510 cases of severe COVID-19).\n Using random-effects models, we pooled relative risk (RR) estimates and conducted metaregression analyses. Results: Of the 373 publications identified in our search, 15 papers met our inclusion criteria, with 51,845 COVID-19 patients including 9,066 severe cases. Older age was consistently associated with severe COVID-19 in all eight eligible studies, with RR >~5 in >60-65 vs. <50 years. Two studies showed no change in the RR of age after adjusting for covariate(s). In univariate analyses, factors significantly associated with severe COVID-19 were male sex (14 studies; pooled RR=1.70, [95%CI 1.52-1.89]), hypertension (10 studies; 2.74 [2.12-3.54]), diabetes (11 studies; 2.81 [2.01-3.93]), and CVD (9 studies; 3.58 [2.06-6.21]).

With the rising number of cases of COVID-19, it would be imperative to develop computer programs which may assist the health professionals in the prevailing scenario. Materials & Methods : A total of two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest X-rays have been assessed by applying ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures in the present study. The digital images were acquired from the public repositories provided by University of Montreal and National Institutes of Health. These digital images of Chest X-rays were divided into three groups labeled as normal, pneumonia and COVID-19. The third group contains digital images of chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection while the second group contains images of lung with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Results : The radiological images included in the data set are 89 images of lungs with COVID-19 infection, 93 images of lungs without any radiological abnormality and 96 images of patient with pneumonia caused by other pathogens.

The WHO has declared COVID-19 infection as pandemic. Extensive efforts are being done to prevent the infection and to control the damage caused by this pathogen but with the passage of time more and more cases are being diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. The most important organ attacked by COVID-19 is lung, which leads to inflammatory changes in lungs and it may cause respiratory insufficiency. The reduced oxygen supply (hypoxia) to the human cells will have deleterious effects on the human living cells and ultimately multi-organ failure may also develop in some cases which has high mortality rate. The radiological assessment of lung is important part of patient care in the severely ill patient infected with COVID-19. The evaluation of radiological imaging is a specialized job and requires the opinion of the consultant radiologist. In the prevailing current scenario, it would be imperative to develop adjunct tool which could assist the health professionals who are heavily burdened in the current situation. In this regard, one of the important areas is the interpretation of radiological images with the help of artificial intelligence. The application of deep learning machine approached may yield promising results in the detection of morphological changes in the lung of patients infected with COVID-19 on digital images of chest X-rays. The computer vision based programs may identify the subtle changes on the digital images which may not be detectable or visible to human eye. The convolutional neural network has been applied for the diagnosis of tuberculosis on the Chest X-rays and it has revealed very good results [15] . Similarly another study revealed that deep learning algorithms can help in the identification of lung opacities, enlargement of heart and pleural effusion on chest X-rays [16] . Due to the better automated feature extraction capability, the convolutional neural networks which have been trained on natural images turned out to be very successful in the classification of images [17] . The performance of convolutional neural network related to the imaging modalities with less human intervention has been found to be better than other conventional methods of machine learning [18] .\nIn the present study, ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures have been applied which yielded the accuracy of 98.18 %, and F1-score of 98.19. The result of the present study are very encouraging and in near future it could be a very useful adjunct tool for the assessment of chest X-rays in case of suspected patients of COVID-19. The number of cases is one the limitation of this study. The organization and collection of the data of patient of COVID -19 from different countries of world may be planned and subjected to research for further improvement in the diagnostic modalities.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-31","authors_x":"Syed Usama Khalid Bukhari; Syed Safwan Khalid Bukhari; Asmara Syed; SYED SAJID HUSSAIN SHAH","journal_x":null,"doi_x":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044610","H index_x":null,"section":"(which was not peer-reviewed)","total_rank":0.1350806452,"risk_factors":["tuberculosis"],"match_indices":[1690],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":1,"has_tuberculosis?":true,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],["health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"70cc2e5152d3dc4d44494124ff556c9bbe9e6f41","title_x":"Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Severe Pneumonia Caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China Title: The clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus severe pneumonia *Corresponding Author","abstract_x":"1 Background: A new virus broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and was later named 2019 novel 2 coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Human coronaviruses are among the pathogens causing viral respiratory infections, and the recently detected strain called SARS-CoV-2 has caused a big challenge for countries all over the world (15, 16) . This is the third contagious Coronavirus leading to an epidemic in the 21st century after MERS and SARS (17) .\nThe key problems surrounding this novel virus are as follows: diagnosis, mode of transmission, long incubation period (3 to 14 days), predicting the number of infected cases in the community, and insufficient protection resources due to its pandemic specification (15, 18) . The accurate transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, since various factors impact its transmission. Moreover, infection of family clusters and healthcare workers indicate the human to human transmission of the disease and its contagiousness, which makes the condition more complicated (19, 20) . Since SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified pathogen, there is no pre-existing immunity to it in the human community, also there is no definitive cure to interrupt or reduce its astonishing spread. These ambiguities make the condition more serious for vulnerable members of the community, which include individuals with immune problems, co-existing comorbidity and elderly people. Despite the novelty of the topic, there are a lot of proposed studies about history, transmission route, urgency of responding, pathogenic potential characteristics and prevention strategies but there are still some underlying diseases that have remained unknown (21) . According to the current analysis, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, kidney disease, smoking, and COPDs were among the most prevalent underlying diseases among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In terms of pre-existing medical conditions, cardiovascular diseases had the highest prevalence among diseases that put patients at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 threats. Decreasing the proinflammatory cytokines, which leads to a weaker immune function may account for this condition (2, 22) . It is worth noting that similar results were found regarding MERS (23) . We also found that smokers are more susceptible to Coronavirus infections, especially to the most recent species. Various reasons may justify this happening. It has been mentioned that smokers have unregulated ACE2 in remodeled cell types, which is consistent with results of SARS studies. However, factors such as amount of smoking, the duration of smoking, and the duration of smoking cessation also play a role. In some previous studies on MERS-CoV-2 it has been shown that dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), which is the specific receptor for this virus, had a higher rate of expression in smokers and COPD patients (24) . Although the results of the current analysis indicate that smoking can be an underlying factor that makes people susceptible to COVID-19 complications, in some studies, especially COVID-19 related studies, no strong evidence has been found regarding the correlation of COPD and smoking with being infected with this new virus. But the important point that must be taken into consideration is that the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is more severe in COPD cases and smokers (25) . As mentioned in the results section, patients with malignancies are more in danger than those without any tumor. Anticancer treatments such as chemotherapy and surgery put this group into an immunosuppressive state and subsequently at higher risk of MERS-CoV-2 infection (26) . Among those with malignancies, lung cancer patients seems to be more susceptible, and they must follow guidance on restricting any contact with possible infected zones or individuals for their safety (14) . Possible risk factors for progressive and severe illness may include the above-mentioned factors but are not limited to them; pregnancy and old age are other risky conditions, which should be monitored meticulously. However, there is no clear evidence about the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to the newborn during vaginal delivery or transmission via breastfeeding but care and protection of newborns against possible exposure to infection or contaminated conditions such as maternal breast contamination must be observed. Since MERS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, no specific treatment is currently available (27, 28) , and pathophysiology of this condition is still unknown. Therefore, general prevention measures such as the following should be followed: Washing hands frequently and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth with contaminated hands, avoiding close contact ,especially with those who have fever, coughing or sneezing, avoiding contact with live animals and consuming raw animal products (29) . There are some responsibilities for health policymakers in this critical condition: Screening of travelers, triage all patients on admission and immediately isolating all suspected and confirmed cases, providing protective gear, preparing local guidance and instructions for people, especially for high risk groups (30, 31) . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis that estimates the prevalence of underlying diseases in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Given that most studies on CoVID-19 are in an early stage, and there are some limitations such as small number of studies, and reports being restricted to China and a few other countries, due to the pandemic nature of the disease, specific patterns should be introduced for different groups, including people with underlying diseases, to minimize the harm. Based on the experiences gained on this disease during this short time, a strong recommendation for all people, clinicians, and policymakers is to guide people to protect themselves to avoid being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, whenever possible (32) . Another very important advice to patients with underlying diseases during the epidemics like the one caused by the novel virus is to follow guidance on travel restrictions. These groups must be aware of their high-risk situation and comply with all health guidelines such as hand hygiene, face care, and restricting social interactions. In addition, to reduce the morbidity and complications of COVID-19 in different populations, especially patients with the mentioned underlying diseases, we recommend clinicians and policymakers to launch diagnostic procedures for such individuals first so that proper treatments can be designed and followed to ensure they are protected within epidemic regions (33) .\nIn summary, the results of the current study have shown that in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and diabetes are the most prevalent co-existing disorders. Given that COVID-19 has a relatively long incubation period and during this time the infected person can transmit the virus without showing symptoms, it is strongly recommended that patients with chronic or underlying diseases avoid any close contact with other people in the community, especially in epidemic areas. During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the statistics reported by different countries regarding associated mortality of those with risk factors, incubation time, and estimated overall mortality have not been consistent and general conclusions should be drawn with caution. It should be noted that the outbreak worsens with decrease in adherence to diagnostic guidelines and prevention strategies, such as avoiding traveling and gathering in public places.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-24","authors_x":"Emami, Amir; Javanmardi, Fatemeh; Pirbonyeh, Neda; Akbari, Ali","journal_x":"Arch Acad Emerg Med","doi_x":null,"H index_x":null,"section":"Discussion","total_rank":0.0616808019,"risk_factors":["smoking","diabetes","pregnancy"],"match_indices":[1796,2290,2456,2596,2621,2650,2862,2954,3173,3361,6801,1770,6814,3987],"smoking_count":11,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":2,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":1,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact","contact","contact","contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["model"],["outbreak","outbreak"],[],["statist"],["analysi","analysi","analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["meta-analysis"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk"],[],["duration","duration"],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],["route"],["age","age","age"],[],[],["health","health","health"],[],[],[],["incub","incub","incub"],[],["factor","factor","factor","factor","factor","factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"655b175741b74ae8c98f93fd449c88a147bee96e","title_x":"): e35 REVIEW ARTICLE A.

To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined. Therefore, we herein established a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241-and 149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs.","text_body":"The peptides or peptide mixtures were dissolved in PBS to prepare a solution with a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and then measured on a Jasco-815-circular dichroism spectrometer. 35 The scanning wavelength range was 198-260 nm.\nThermal denaturation detection starts at 222 nm with a 5\u00b0C\/min thermal gradient detection.\nMouse infection studies Newborn mice were bred from pregnant mice purchased from the Animal Center of Fudan University, and all the related experiments were carried out in strict accordance with institutional regulations (approval number 20190221-070, approval date 21 February 2019). Each group had 12 3-day-old mice. To test the protective effect of peptides on HCoV-infected mice, EK1C4 (0.5 mg\/kg), EK1 (20 mg\/kg) in 2 \u00b5l 28% Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-Cyclodextrin (HBC), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, were administered intranasally 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 h before challenge, or 0.5 and 2 h after challenge. Then mice were challenged intranasally with HCoV at a dose of 10 2 TCID 50 . For the viral control group, the same volume of 28% HBC or PBS was administered intranasally. In each group, six mice were randomly selected for euthanasia on day 5 after infection, then five mice for collecting and assessing the viral titer in mouse brain, one mouse for brain histological examination. Body weight and survival of the remaining six mice in each group were monitored for 14 days. 30 Cytotoxicity assay Cytotoxicity of the peptides to the cells (Vero-E6, Huh-7, LLC-MK2 and RD cells) was tested by using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). Briefly, each cell type was seeded into the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (10,000 per well) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 12-15 h, replacing medium with DMED containing EK1C4 at graded concentrations to culture at 37\u00b0C for 2 days; CCK-8 solution (10 \u03bcL per well) was added, followed by an additional incubation for 4 h. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm.\nExpression and purification of fusion protein HR1-L6-HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 The coding sequences of HR1 (residues 910-988) and HR2 (residues 1162-1206) domains of SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunits were tandem linked though a 6-residue linker (L6: SGGRGG). The resulting sequences encoding the fused HR1-L6-HR2 protein were then cloned into a modified pET-28a vector containing a His 6 -SUMO tag upstream of the multiple cloning site. The recombinant construct was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown in lysogeny broth (LB) media supplemented with 50 \u03bcg\/mL kanamycin at 37\u00b0C and were induced with 1 mM IPTG for 12 h at 16\u00b0C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and were lysed by high-pressure homogenizer twice after resuspension in buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 200 mM NaCl. The fusion proteins were isolated by Niaffinity chromatography, and the SUMO tag was removed by Ulp1 enzyme (1:100 w\/w) cleavage. HR1-L6-HR2 protein was concentrated and gel-filtered on a 10\/300 Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) column. Peak fractions containing HR1-L6-HR2 trimer were pooled and concentrated to 20 mg\/ml through centrifugation (EMD Millipore).\nCrystallization and structure determination Crystals were obtained at 16\u00b0C for 7 days using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volume of protein solution (HR1-L6-HR2, 10 mg\/mL) and reservoir solution (10% PEG8000, 200 mM zinc acetate, 0.1 M MES, pH 6.0). Then crystals were flash-frozen and transferred to liquid nitrogen for data collection. On the in-house (Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences) X-ray source (MicroMax 007 generator (Rigaku, Japan)) combined with Varimax HR optics (Rigaku, Japan), HR1-L6-HR2 crystals at 100 K were diffracted to 2.9-\u00c5 resolution at a wavelength of 1.5418 \u00c5. A native set of X-ray diffraction data was collected with the R-AXIS IV++ detector (Rigaku, Japan) with an exposure time of 3 min per image and was indexed and processed using iMosflm. 36 The space group of the collected dataset is P21.\nMolecular replacement was performed with PHENIX.phaser 37 to solve the phasing problem, using the SARS-CoV S protein core structure (PDB code 1WYY) as a search model. The final model was manually adjusted in COOT and refined with Refmac. 38 Data collection statistics and refinement statistics are given in Table 1 . Coordinates were deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 6LXT).

Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, initially termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic. In order to assess the potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants. Recommendations are also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials, and implementation of future 2019-nCoV vaccines.\n Viruses 2020, 12, 194 2 of 16 tract infections. Both the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have several features in common that are factors in producing nosocomial transmission, replication in the lower respiratory tract, and viral immunopathology. Both coronaviruses are zoonotic infections and constitute significant public health threats that have resulted in epidemics with significant loss of life [1, 5, 6] . When the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infect women who are pregnant, they can result in poor obstetric outcomes including maternal morbidity and death. There are currently no vaccines or specific treatments approved for coronavirus infections [2, 6] .\n Prior to December 2019, there were a total of six coronavirus species that produced human infection: HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 belonging to the Alphacoronavirus genus; and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV, which belong to the Betacoronavirus genus [1,2]. As of December 2019, there are now seven species that infect humans.\n As the newly identified novel coronavirus, termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently named SARS-CoV-2, spreads rapidly throughout China and across to other countries, researchers scramble to understand transmission dynamics, virulence, and pathogenicity. Given the rapidly progressive spread of this current 2019 novel coronavirus it is reasonable to expect that pregnant women have already become infected. The effect of 2019-nCoV during pregnancy is, at the present, unknown. This communication reviews the medical and clinical findings from coronavirus infections in pregnant women in order to anticipate how the newly discovered 2019-nCoV might affect maternal and infant morbidity and mortality.\n Funding: This research received no external funding.\n The authors declare no conflict of interest.","text_body":"Coronaviruses are spherical, enveloped, and the largest of positive-strand RNA viruses. They have a wide host range, including birds, farm animals, pets, camels, and bats, in which they primarily cause respiratory and gastrointestinal disease. Belonging to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and the subfamily Orthocoronaviridae there are four genera of coronaviruses-Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacorona virus, and Gammacoronavirus [1] [2] [3] [4] .\nIn humans, they are a cause of mild illnesses including the common colds occurring in children and adults, and were believed to be of modest medical importance. However, two zoonotic coronaviruses-including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-can produce severe lower respiratory In the beginning of December 2019, a cluster of persons with a pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province and a large city of approximately 11 million persons located in the central region of the People's Republic of China [7, 8] . Between 8 and 18 December 2019 there were 7 cases of pneumonia identified whose clinical features resembled that of a viral pneumonia. The outbreak was initially believed to be linked to the Wuhan Huanan (South China) Seafood Wholesale Market. This market, termed a \"wet\" market, sells a variety of seafood, cuts of meat, and both live and dead animals in over one thousand stalls in constant close contact; however, whether this market was the origin of the outbreak remains unknown [9] . On 31 December 2019, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) sent a rapid response team to Hubei to work alongside health personnel from the provincial and Wuhan city health departments to conduct an epidemiologic investigation. As the disease was spreading through secondary and tertiary cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed on 31 December 2019 of the occurrence of these cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology. During the period from 31 December 2019 to 3 January 2020, 44 patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported by the Chinese authorities to the WHO. On 7 January 2020 investigators in China identified the etiological agent of the epidemic as a previously unknown coronavirus, and it was given the designation 2019-nCoV (for 2019 novel coronavirus) [8] . Analysis of the clinical features of 41 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection revealed that 30 were men (73%); less than one-half had underlying co-morbid conditions (13; 32%) which included diabetes (8, 20%) , hypertension (6, 15%), and cardiovascular disease (6; 15%); and the average age was 49.0 years old. The most common symptoms at the beginning of their illness included fever (40, 98%) , cough (31, 76%) , and fatigue or myalgia (18, 44%) , sputum production (11, 28%) , and headache (3, 8%) [10] . Among these 41 initial cases of 2019-nCoV infection there were 12 patients (32%) who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 13 (32%) required intensive care and 6 (15%) died. During the first weeks of January the infection spread rapidly through China and extended to adjacent countries where cases began to appear-13 January in Thailand, 15 January in Japan, 20 January in the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan and the United States on 21 January [11] . Infected travelers, mostly via commercial air travel, are known to have been responsible for introducing the virus outside of Wuhan. The new coronavirus continued to spread throughout multiple countries and continents, and by 9 February 2020 the WHO reported 37,251 confirmed cases in China that resulted in 812 deaths, surpassing the number of deaths that occurred during the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. An additional 307 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have occurred among 24 other countries outside of China [12] .

In reviewing these reports describing pregnant women with SARS in China it is possible, and perhaps even probable, that some of the same patients were included in more than one publication. However, even if this is the case, there is no doubt that SARS coronavirus infection was found to be associated with severe maternal illness, maternal death, and spontaneous abortion [19, [28] [29] [30] [31] . Martha Anker, an expert in statistics formerly with the WHO and the University of Massachusetts, estimated that more than 100 cases of SARS-CoV infection occurred in pregnant women, which warrants closer inspection [27] .\nThe clinical outcomes among pregnant women with SARS in Hong Kong were worse than those occurring in infected women who were not pregnant [32] . Wong et al. [29] evaluated the obstetrical outcomes from a cohort of pregnant women who developed SARS in Hong Kong during the period of 1 February to 31 July 2003. Four of the 7 women (57%) that presented during the 1st trimester sustained spontaneous miscarriages, likely a result of the hypoxia that was caused by SARS-related acute respiratory distress. Among the 5 women who presented after 24 weeks gestation, 4 had preterm deliveries (80%).\nA case-control study to determine the effects of SARS on pregnancy compared 10 pregnant and 40 non-pregnant women with the infection at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong [27, 33] . There were 3 deaths among the pregnant women with SARS (maternal mortality rate of 30%) and no deaths in the non-pregnant group of infected women (P = 0.006). Renal failure (P = 0.006) and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (P = 0.006) developed more frequently in pregnant SARS patients when compared with the non-pregnant SARS group. Six pregnant women with SARS required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (60%) and 4 required endotracheal intubation (40%), compared with a 12.5% intubation rate (P = 0.065) and 17.5% ICU admission rate (P = 0.012) in the non-pregnant group.\nMaxwell et al. [32] reported 7 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV who were followed at a designated SARS unit-2 of the 7 died (CFR of 28%), and 4 (57%) required ICU hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. In contrast, the mortality rate was less than 10% and mechanical ventilation rate less than 20% among non-pregnant, age-matched counterparts who were not infected with SARS-CoV. Two women with SARS recovered and maintained their pregnancy but had infants with IUGR. Among the live newborn infants, none had clinical or laboratory evidence for SARS-CoV infection. The new mothers who had developed SARS were advised not to breastfeed to prevent possible vertical transmission of the virus.\nZhang et al. [34] described SARS-CoV infections in 5 primagravidas from Guangzhou, China at the height of the SARS epidemic. Two of the mothers became infected in the 2nd trimester, and 3 developed infection in the 3rd trimester. Two of the pregnant women had hospital-acquired SARS infections, and the other 3 were community-acquired. All 5 pregnant women had fever and abnormal chest radiographs; 4 had cough; 4 developed hypoalbuminemia; 3 had elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (ALT), 3 had chills or rigor, 2 had decreased lymphocytes, and 2 had decreased platelets. One pregnant woman required intensive care, but all recovered and there were no maternal deaths. The 5 infants were clinically evaluated, and none had evidence of SARS.\nTwo pregnant women with SARS were reported from the United States. In a detailed case report, Robertson et al. [35] described a 36-year-old pregnant woman with an intermittent cough of approximately 10 days duration and no fever. While travelling in Hong Kong during the 2003 epidemic, she was exposed at her hotel to a person subsequently known to be infected with SARS-CoV. At 19 weeks gestation she developed fever, anorexia, headache, increasing cough, weakness, and shortness of breath. Upon returning to the United States she was hospitalized with pneumonia. Obstetrical ultrasounds revealed a low-lying placenta (placenta previa) but were otherwise normal. Following her discharge home and clinical recovery, she was found to have antibodies to SARS-CoV. She underwent cesarean section at 38 weeks gestation because of the placenta previa and a healthy baby girl was delivered [35, 36] . The placenta was interpreted as being normal. At 130 days post-maternal illness, maternal serum and whole blood, swabs from maternal nasopharynx and rectum, post-delivery placenta, umbilical cord blood, amniotic fluid, and breast milk were collected for analysis-no viral RNA was detected in specimens tested by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Antibodies to SARS-CoV were detected from maternal serum, umbilical cord blood, and breast milk by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and indirect immunofluorescence assay. No clinical specimens (except for cord blood) were available for testing from the infant. The second case in the USA occurred in a 38-year-old woman who had travelled to Hong Kong at 7 weeks gestation where she was exposed to SARS-CoV in the same hotel as the aforementioned American woman [37] . Following her return to the United States, her husband developed the clinical onset of SARS, and 6 days later she became ill with fever, myalgia, chills, headache, coryza, and a productive cough with shortness of breath and wheezing. Following her hospitalization for SARS she recovered, serum samples taken on days 28 and 64 post-onset of illness were positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV by enzyme immunoassay and immunofluorescent assays. Her pregnancy continued and was unremarkable except for developing elevated glucose levels. A cesarean section that was performed at 36 weeks gestation due to preterm rupture of membranes and fetal distress resulted in a healthy baby boy. At the time of delivery, the mother's serum samples were positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV, but samples taken of umbilical cord blood and placenta were negative. Breast milk sampled 12 and 30 days after delivery were also negative for SARS-CoV antibodies. Specimens evaluated from maternal blood, stool, and nasopharynx samples, as well as umbilical cord blood of the infant, were all negative for coronavirus RNA by RT-PCR. Neonatal stool samples obtained on days-of-life 12 and 30 were also negative for viral RNA.\nFrom Canada, Yudin et al. [38] reported a 33-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted to the hospital at 31 weeks gestation with a fever, dry cough, and abnormal chest radiograph demonstrating patchy infiltrates. She had acquired SARS from contact with an infected family member. Following a 21-day stay in the hospital, during which she did not require ventilatory support, her convalescent antibody titers were positive for coronavirus infection. She had a normal labor and delivery and her newborn girl had no evidence of infection.\nIn a study of 5 liveborn neonates who were delivered to women infected with SARS-CoV during the Hong Kong epidemic, results from multiple tests-including serial RT-PCR assays, viral culture, and paired neonatal serological titers-were negative for SARS-CoV [39] . None of the 5 neonates developed any clinical signs or symptoms of respiratory infection or compromise.\nFortunately, there were no cases of vertical transmission identified among pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV during the 2002-2003 Asian epidemic [27, 30, 31, 39, 40] , and with the exception of a small cluster of cases that recurred in late 2003, no new cases of SARS have occurred.","publish_time_x":"2020","authors_x":"Schwartz, David A.; Graham, Ashley L.","journal_x":"Viruses","doi_x":"10.3390\/v12020194","H index_x":59.0,"section":"SARS and Pregnancy","total_rank":0.0722807018,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[77,175,247,775,859,960,1045,1481,1503,1523,1645,1728,1885,1935,1960,2191,2238,2525,2648,3149,3250,3490,3659,3795,5825,6633,7558],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":37,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":true,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["statist"],["analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],["duration"],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age"],[],[],["health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["serial"]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"779c1b5cb3afe3d50219aa2af791014a22eb355a","title_x":"viruses Perspective Potential Maternal and Infant Outcomes from Coronavirus 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus Infections","abstract_x":"In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People's Republic of China.

Three placentas were delivered from pregnancies in which the mothers had acute SARS-CoV infection-these were abnormal and demonstrated increased subchorionic and intervillous fibrin, a finding that can be associated with abnormal maternal blood flow to the placenta. In the placentas of 2 women who were convalescing from SARS-CoV infection in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy the placentas were highly abnormal. They showed extensive fetal thrombotic vasculopathy with areas of avascular chorionic villi-chronic findings of fetal vascular malperfusion.

In the 8 years since then, there have been more than 2494 confirmed cases of MERS resulting in upwards of 858 deaths globally [46] . While 27 countries have reported cases of MERS, approximately 80% of confirmed cases originated in Saudi Arabia [47] . To date, all known cases of MERS can be linked to travel or residence in countries along the Arabian Peninsula-that is, Bahrain; Iraq; Iran; Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Oman; Qatar, Saudi Arabia; Syria; the United Arab Emirates (UAE); and Yemen [48] . The largest documented outbreak outside of this region occurred in 2015 in the Republic of Korea, in which 186 infections occurred, resulting in 38 deaths [49] . The index case in this outbreak reportedly returned from the Arabian Peninsula just prior to onset of illness [50] .\nMERS-CoV is characterized by sporadic zoonotic transmission events as well as spread between infected patients and close contacts (i.e., intra-familial transmission) [51] . Nosocomial outbreaks in health care settings-the result of poor infection control and prevention-are widely recognized as the hallmark of MERS [1] . Superspreading events have been recorded in healthcare settings in Jordan, Al Hasa, Jeddah, Abu Dhabi and South Korea [47, [52] [53] [54] [55] . Like other coronaviruses, MERS-CoV can be spread through person-to-person contact, likely via infected respiratory secretions [48] . Transmission dynamics, however, are otherwise poorly understood [1] . Bats are believed to be the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV, and dromedary camels can have the virus and have been suggested as possible intermediary hosts as well as a source of infection to humans [2, 56, 57] .\nThere are no clinical or serological reports of perinatal transmission of MERS, though vertical transmission has been reported for non-coronavirus respiratory viruses including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [58] . Researchers have not yet discovered ongoing transmission of MERS-CoV within communities outside of health care settings.\nThe clinical presentation of MERS varies from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multiple organ failure, often resulting in death. Most patients with MERS develop severe acute respiratory illness accompanied by fever, cough, and shortness of breath [50] . Progression to pneumonia is swift-usually within the first week -and at least one-third of patients also present with gastrointestinal symptoms [1] . MERS progresses much more rapidly to respiratory failure and has a higher case fatality rate than SARS [1] . Unlike SARS, however, infection with MERS-CoV is generally mild in healthy individuals but more severe in immunocompromised patients and people with underlying comorbidities [1] . The overall CFR of MERS is approximately 34.4% [46] . Most fatalities have been associated with pre-existing medical conditions like chronic lung disease, diabetes, and renal failure, as well as weakened immune systems [59] , making such individuals high risk. As a result of the immunological changes that occur during pregnancy, women who are pregnant are included in this high-risk group. Pregnant women may develop severe disease and fatal maternal and\/or fetal outcomes as a result of MERS-CoV infection; however, little is known of the pathophysiology of this infection during pregnancy.","publish_time_x":"2020","authors_x":"Schwartz, David A.; Graham, Ashley L.","journal_x":"Viruses","doi_x":"10.3390\/v12020194","H index_x":59.0,"section":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)","total_rank":0.1218045113,"risk_factors":["diabetes","pregnancy"],"match_indices":[3187,3352,3377,3424,3615],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":14,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":true,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact","contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak","outbreak","outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk"],[],[],["asymptomatic"],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],[],[],[],["health","health","health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"779c1b5cb3afe3d50219aa2af791014a22eb355a","title_x":"viruses Perspective Potential Maternal and Infant Outcomes from Coronavirus 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus Infections","abstract_x":"In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People's Republic of China.

It is likely, however, that the immunological changes that normally occur in pregnancy may alter susceptibility to the MERS-CoV and the severity of clinical illness [60] . Pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV, a related coronavirus, appear to have increased morbidity and mortality when compared to non-pregnant women, suggesting that MERS-CoV could also lead to severe clinical outcomes in pregnancy. To date, however, very few pregnancy-associated cases (n = 11) have been documented, with 91% having adverse clinical outcomes.\nBetween November 2012 and February 2016, there were 1308 cases of MERS reported by the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health (MoH). Of these, 5 patients were pregnant, according to a retrospective study by Assiri et al. [47] , and all resulted in adverse outcomes. Patient ages ranged from 27 to 34 years, with occurrence of exposure in either the 2nd or 3rd trimester. All 5 cases received intensive care. Two women died and there were 2 cases of perinatal death-1 stillbirth and 1 neonatal death shortly after emergency cesarean section. These instances of severe maternal and perinatal outcomes are consistent with other reports of MERS-CoV infection in pregnant women, as well as outcomes associated with SARS-CoV infection. The authors of the retrospectives study concede that unreported cases of MERS in pregnancy are likely due to lack of routine pregnancy testing [47] . They conclude that pregnancy testing for women of reproductive age should be considered for those who test positive for MERS-CoV, to contribute to overall understanding of pathogenesis and epidemiological risk. Additionally, 2 of the 5 patients were healthcare workers, which corresponds with existing knowledge of higher risk of exposure to MERS-CoV in healthcare settings.\nIn a separate case report of MERS occurring in pregnancy, Alserehi et al. [58] described a 33-year-old critical care nurse who became infected during the 3rd trimester in the midst of a large hospital outbreak. In the days following hospital admission, she developed respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation and administration of dexamethasone as prophylaxis for the fetus. Following an emergency cesarean section at 32 weeks gestation, she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and later recovered. The preterm but otherwise healthy infant was kept in the neonatal unit for observation and later released along with his mother. In contrast to other reported cases, this patient had a successful outcome, perhaps due to the timing of MERS-CoV exposure, her young age, the use of steroids, and differences in immune response.\nAlfaraj et al. [61] described 2 cases of maternal infection with MERS-CoV at the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz Hospital (PMAH) in Saudi Arabia. Maternal infection in both cases was confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab testing by RT-PCR. One patient was a 29-year-old woman at 6 weeks gestation with no underlying medical conditions. The second patient, a 39-year-old at 24 weeks gestation, had several comorbidities, including end stage renal disease, hypertension, and hemodialysis. This woman presented to the hospital after contact with a MERS-CoV-infected person during an active outbreak. Both patients later tested negative for MERS-CoV and were subsequently discharged. The younger patient delivered a healthy, full-term infant. The status of the other delivery is unknown. Neither fetus was tested for MERS-CoV.\nAccording to Payne et al. [62] , epidemiologic investigation of the 2012 MERS outbreak in Zarqa, Jordan, revealed that a 2nd trimester stillbirth (5 months gestational age) had occurred as a result of maternal exposure to MERS-CoV. The mother experienced fever, fatigue, headache and cough, concurrently with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. On the 7th day of symptoms, she had a fetal death. The mother was confirmed to have antibody to MERS-CoV, and she self-reported having had unprotected contact with family members who later tested positive for the virus. This was the first documented occurrence of stillbirth during maternal infection with MERS-CoV.\nOn 24 November 2013, a 32-year-old pregnant woman in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) developed ARDS following admission to the ICU after suspected community-acquired pneumonia advanced to respiratory failure and hypotension [60] . Later that day, her baby was delivered by caesarean section and subsequent Apgar scores were within healthy range. The next day, RT-PCR evaluation revealed that the mother was positive for MERS-CoV. Despite rigorous intervention, including oral ribavirin-peginterferon-\u03b1 therapy and ventilator support, the woman continued to deteriorate, developed septic shock, and died. While the outcome for this mother was fatal, Malik et al. noted that virus shedding ceased during therapy with ribavirin and peginterferon-\u03b1 and radiographic evidence indicated clinical improvement before her death [58] . More research is needed to determine safety, efficacy, and dosage of these therapies in the general population but also in pregnant women. While few data exist on the effects of these treatments in pregnant humans, ribavirin is generally contraindicated during pregnancy [58] .\nOutside of the Middle East the only confirmed case of MERS in pregnancy occurred in 2015 in South Korea. Jeong et al. [49] reported that a 39-year-old patient was exposed during the 3rd trimester following contact with a patient having MERS. Despite abrupt vaginal bleeding and rupture of membranes, the patient recovered fully and delivered a healthy infant at 37 weeks and 5 days gestation. Subsequent testing of the infant's blood did not detect any IgG, IgM, or IgA antibodies to MERS-CoV.\nThe mean maternal age of the 11 confirmed maternal SARS cases described above was 33.2 years, with a mean gestational age of 26.3 weeks. The source of infection in 2 of the cases was attributed to contact with family members who tested positive for MERS-CoV, unknown in 3 cases, likely due to animal exposure in 1 case, and 6 were healthcare-associated (2 of these patients were healthcare workers). Six patients required intensive care and 3 died. Of those who died, 2 were exposed to MERS-CoV in the 3rd trimester, and 1 was exposed during the 2nd trimester. The infant death rate for all 11 cases was 27%. Fetal survival did not appear to correlate with the timing of maternal infection and gestational age; however, more data are needed to draw conclusions about this relationship. According to Alfaraj et al. [61] , the CFR for the 11 infected women-also 27%-was not statistically different from the overall CFR of MERS in the general population (35%) (P = 0.75). Only 1 case resulted in both maternal and fetal death.\nSimilar to SARS in pregnancy, more research is needed to understand the pathogenesis and epidemiology of MERS in pregnancy including the relationship between the timing of maternal infection, gestational age of the fetus, the effects of comorbid factors, and the occurrence of adverse outcomes. Few studies documented the presence of MERS-CoV antibodies in the umbilical cord or neonatal blood, making it difficult to assess perinatal transmission. As such, future studies should involve the collection of samples from relevant specimens including amniotic fluid, placenta, and umbilical cord [49] .","publish_time_x":"2020","authors_x":"Schwartz, David A.; Graham, Ashley L.","journal_x":"Viruses","doi_x":"10.3390\/v12020194","H index_x":59.0,"section":"MERS and Pregnancy","total_rank":0.0718065004,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[75,196,291,423,511,549,802,1301,1454,1498,1542,1945,4263,5176,5251,5314,5393,6868,6962],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":29,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":true,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact","contact","contact","contact"],["surviv"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["investigati"],[],["outbreak","outbreak","outbreak"],[],["statist"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["retrospective study"],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk"],["range","range"],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],["reproducti"],[],["age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],["Health","health","health","health","health","health","health","health","health"],[],["shedd"],[],[],[],["factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"779c1b5cb3afe3d50219aa2af791014a22eb355a","title_x":"viruses Perspective Potential Maternal and Infant Outcomes from Coronavirus 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus Infections","abstract_x":"In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People's Republic of China.

There are clearly challenges to this endeavor-protective antibodies to coronaviruses are not long-lasting, tissue damage has been reported to occur as a result of exposure to SARS-CoV, development of animal models that closely resemble human infection are limited, and the extensive time and expense necessary to perform clinical trials in humans, to name a few [66] [67] [68] .\nIt is vitally important that pregnant women be considered in the design, clinical trial, and implementation of vaccine candidates for 2019-nCoV. In examining the history of vaccine design, it is clear that the needs of pregnant women have rarely been prioritized in either the preclinical development or the clinical trial phases of production. Today, pregnant women are usually excluded from experimental trial of drugs and vaccines that do not target obstetric conditions [69] . Excluding pregnant women and their infants from participation in vaccine development and implementation undermines ethical principles of justice-fairness, equity, and maximization of benefit-and potentially places their health at risk during outbreaks and other health emergencies [69] [70] [71] .\nOn 23 January 2020 the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced three programs to develop a vaccine against the novel Wuhan coronavirus. The Chief Executive Officer of CEPI, Richard Hatchett, said [72] :\n\"Given the rapid global spread of the nCoV-2019 virus the world needs to act quickly and in unity to tackle this disease. Our intention with this work is to leverage our work on the MERS coronavirus and rapid response platforms to speed up vaccine development.\"\nThe novel coronavirus is the first epidemic disease to emerge since the formation of CEPI in Davos in 2017. CEPI was created with the express intent to enable speedy research and development of vaccines against emerging pathogens. In May 2017, WHO released the Target Product Profile (TPP) for MERS-CoV vaccines, following the prioritization of MERS-CoV as one of eight priority pathogens for prevention of epidemics [73] . CEPI and partners aim to use existing platforms-that is, the existing \"backbone\" that can be adapted for use against new pathogens-that are currently in preclinical development for MERS-CoV vaccine candidates. Following the WHO declaration on 30 January that the current 2019-nCoV outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), global health organizations and researchers will be further mobilized-bolstered by new mechanisms for action and greater resources-to stop the spread of disease.\nA critical question that must be answered at this stage-with a clear view of the potential deleterious effects of a new coronavirus in pregnancy-is will maternal immunization be a priority in research and development? As of the PHEIC declaration, 12 groups have announced that they are developing new vaccines against 2019-nCoV and seven others announced initiatives to develop new therapies [74] . Safe testing of experimental vaccines in a pregnant population is difficult and, as a result, vaccines are not typically developed with pregnant women in mind. To date, very few clinical trials for vaccines have proactively included pregnant women [75] , and the exclusion of pregnant and lactating women from receiving the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine through 3 Ebola virus epidemics serves as a recent example [69] [70] [71] . Given the potential severity in pregnancy, as demonstrated by this review of maternal infections of SARS and MERS, women who are pregnant should be considered a priority population in all efforts to prepare for and prevent infection by novel coronaviruses.","publish_time_x":"2020","authors_x":"Schwartz, David A.; Graham, Ashley L.","journal_x":"Viruses","doi_x":"10.3390\/v12020194","H index_x":59.0,"section":"Participation of Pregnant Women in the Development of a Coronavirus Vaccine","total_rank":0.1318181818,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[589,779,912,1051,2903,3210,3303,3400,3443,3618,3715],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":21,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":true,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],["Profil"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["model"],["outbreak","outbreak"],[],[],[],["experiment","experiment"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk"],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age","age"],[],[],["health","health","health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"779c1b5cb3afe3d50219aa2af791014a22eb355a","title_x":"viruses Perspective Potential Maternal and Infant Outcomes from Coronavirus 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus Infections","abstract_x":"In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People's Republic of China.

According to the official Xinhua news agency, the infant was delivered on 2 February to a mother who had tested positive for the virus. Reports have stated that the infant had stable vital signs, no fever or cough, but had shortness of breath together with abnormal chest radiographs and abnormalities of liver function [76] [77] [78] . Dr. Zeng Lingkong, Chief Physician at the Neonatal Medicine Department of the hospital, said [78] , \"This reminds us to pay attention to mother-to-child being a possible route of coronavirus transmission\"\nThe hospital also provided information about a previous case of a baby that had been delivered on 13 January 2020. Following its birth, the infant's nanny was diagnosed with 2019-nCoV, and the mother was diagnosed days later [76] . On 29 January the baby began to develop symptoms. According to Dr. Zeng Lingkong [76] , \"Whether it was the baby's nanny who passed the virus to the mother who passed it to the baby, we cannot be sure at the moment. But we can confirm that the baby was in close contact with patients infected with the new coronavirus, which says newborns can also be infected\"\nIn considering whether these and future cases of neonatal infection are acquired prior to delivery, it is important to remember that newborn infants can acquire an infection in other ways beyond intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission. In some cases, viral infection can be acquired when the infant passes through the birth canal during a vaginal delivery or through post-partum breast feeding, although these mechanisms would be highly unusual for a respiratory virus. Neonatal infection from respiratory viruses can occur after delivery through such mechanisms as inhalation of the agent through aerosols produced by coughing from the mother, relatives or healthcare workers or other sources in the hospital environment. Based upon past experience with pregnant women who developed MERS and SARS, and realizing that the numbers are limited, there has never been confirmed intrauterine coronavirus transmission from mother to fetus. Discussing the most recent baby to be diagnosed with the 2019-nCoV infection, Dr. Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University stated [77] , \"It's more likely that the baby contracted the virus from the hospital environment, the same way healthcare workers get infected by the patients they treat,\" \"It's quite possible that the baby picked it up very conventionally-by inhaling virus droplets that came from the mother coughing.\"\nAnd according to Dr. Paul Hunter, Professor of Medicine at the University of East Anglia [79] , \"As far as I am aware there is currently no evidence that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted in the womb. When a baby is born vaginally it is exposed to the mother's gut microbiome, therefore if a baby does get infected with coronavirus a few days after birth we currently cannot tell if the baby was infected in the womb or during birth.\"","publish_time_x":"2020","authors_x":"Schwartz, David A.; Graham, Ashley L.","journal_x":"Viruses","doi_x":"10.3390\/v12020194","H index_x":59.0,"section":"Current Status of 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) Infection of Pregnant Women and Neonates","total_rank":0.1298482293,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[2128],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":11,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":true,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],["route"],["age","age"],[],[],["health","Health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"779c1b5cb3afe3d50219aa2af791014a22eb355a","title_x":"viruses Perspective Potential Maternal and Infant Outcomes from Coronavirus 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus Infections","abstract_x":"In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People's Republic of China. Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, initially termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic. In order to assess the potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants. Recommendations are also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials, and implementation of future 2019-nCoV vaccines.\n Viruses 2020, 12, 194 2 of 16 tract infections. Both the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have several features in common that are factors in producing nosocomial transmission, replication in the lower respiratory tract, and viral immunopathology. Both coronaviruses are zoonotic infections and constitute significant public health threats that have resulted in epidemics with significant loss of life [1, 5, 6] . When the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infect women who are pregnant, they can result in poor obstetric outcomes including maternal morbidity and death. There are currently no vaccines or specific treatments approved for coronavirus infections [2, 6] .\n Prior to December 2019, there were a total of six coronavirus species that produced human infection: HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 belonging to the Alphacoronavirus genus; and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV, which belong to the Betacoronavirus genus [1,2]. As of December 2019, there are now seven species that infect humans.\n As the newly identified novel coronavirus, termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently named SARS-CoV-2, spreads rapidly throughout China and across to other countries, researchers scramble to understand transmission dynamics, virulence, and pathogenicity. Given the rapidly progressive spread of this current 2019 novel coronavirus it is reasonable to expect that pregnant women have already become infected. The effect of 2019-nCoV during pregnancy is, at the present, unknown. This communication reviews the medical and clinical findings from coronavirus infections in pregnant women in order to anticipate how the newly discovered 2019-nCoV might affect maternal and infant morbidity and mortality.\n Funding: This research received no external funding.\n The authors declare no conflict of interest.","text_body":"There is limited knowledge regarding coronavirus infections that occur during pregnancy-what is known has, for the most part, been the result of epidemics resulting from two different diseases, SARS and MERS. These previous experiences with coronavirus infections in pregnancy indicates that these agents are capable of causing adverse clinical outcomes including life-threatening maternal disease that in some cases requires hospitalization, intensive care and ventilatory support. Both of these coronaviruses can result in maternal death in a small but significant number of cases, but the specific risk factors for a fatal outcome during pregnancy have not been clarified. Coronaviruses can also result in adverse outcomes for the fetus and infant including intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, admission to the ICU, spontaneous abortion and perinatal death. Unlike some viral infections, notably Ebola virus [70] and Zika virus [80] , the likelihood of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission of coronaviruses is low-there have been no documented cases of vertical transmission occurring with either SARS or MERS. It remains to be seen during the current Wuhan 2019-nCoV epidemic how this newly-emergent coronavirus affects pregnant women and their infants, as well as which factors may modulate obstetrical disease and outcomes including the timing of maternal coronavirus exposure by gestational age, the effects of medications or other treatment regimens, differences in host immune responses, occurrence of coexisting medical and obstetrical conditions, and other covariables. However, pregnant women should be considered to be at high risk for developing severe infection during this current outbreak of 2019-nCoV. Additional clinical research on the treatment of SARS, MERS, and the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV is necessary if we are to understand the potential risks and benefits of novel therapies and new vaccines in pregnancy. This research will be critical in improving the care, and even saving the lives, of pregnant women in the current as well as future outbreaks.","publish_time_x":"2020","authors_x":"Schwartz, David A.; Graham, Ashley L.","journal_x":"Viruses","doi_x":"10.3390\/v12020194","H index_x":59.0,"section":"Conclusions","total_rank":0.2455621302,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[78,267,641,1243,1609,1943,2038],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":17,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":true,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak","outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk","risk"],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["factor","factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"7e8409337e69a72191475029805c6776ad43b60b","title_x":"Outbreak 2019-nCoV (Wuhan virus), a novel Coronavirus: human-to-human transmission, travel-related cases, and vaccine readiness","abstract_x":"On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China. The first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019. Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV, infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that humanto-human transmission is now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission? What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use of in silico docking in gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic development.

While primarily associated with relatively mild, self-limiting respiratory infections, infection from these viruses can result in severe disease in neonates, the elderly, and those with underlying comorbidities [18] . However, coronaviruses are now considered potential threats to global public health following the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002 (9% CFR), and MERS-CoV in 2012 (35% CFR).\nEarly clinical manifestations of MERS and SARS are largely similar. Influenza-like symptoms accompanied by fevers, chills, dry cough, headache, malaise, and dyspnea were common early in the disease course in SARS patients [19] . The mean incubation period was estimated as 4.6 days with a range of 2 to 8 days between symptom onset and hospitalization. The mean time from symptom onset to death in fatal cases was 23.7 days [20] . Fatal outcomes were most frequent in those > 60 years of age (43% CFR). No fatalities were reported in young children and adolescents and fatal disease was reported in 6.8% of patients < 60 years of age. Phase 1 of SARS was associated with increasing viral load and early disease symptoms (fever, malaise). Phase 2 was characterized by fever, hypoxemia, and decreasing viral loads, while radiographic progression of pneumonia was common. Twenty percent of patients progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Common laboratory features of SARS included lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels [20] [21] [22] . Acute renal impairment and proteinuria were associated with 6.7% and 84% of patients, respectively [21] .\nEarly symptoms of MERS include fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, myalgia, and malaise following a mean incubation period of 5 days, with a range of 2 to 13 days [23] . The median times from symptom onset to hospitalization, ICU admission, and death are 4, 5, and 11.5 days, respectively [24] . Symptomatic MERS patients present with a rapidly progressing pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation and additional organ support within the first week of disease [20] . Severe and fatal disease is strongly linked to underlying comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and chronic cardiac, pulmonary, or renal disease [23] . Laboratory abnormalities include lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated serum creatinine levels consistent with acute kidney injury, and elevated liver enzymes [23, [25] [26] [27] [28] . High lactate levels and consumptive coagulopathy have also been reported [25, 29] .

Among the 14 adult patients, the major symptoms included fever (57.1%), cough (35.7%), chest tightness\/pain (21.4%), fatigue (21.4%) and sore throat (7.1%).

Five discharged children were admitted again because their stool showed positive result in SARS-CoV-2 PCR. COVID-19 in children is mainly caused by family transmission, and their symptoms are mild and prognosis is better than adult. However, their PCR result in stool showed longer time than their families. Because of the mild or asymptomatic clinical process, it is difficult to recognize early for pediatrician and public health staff.","text_body":"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. Aa an enveloped RNA virus, Cov is ubiquitous in humans, other mammals, and birds, which can cause respiratory, digestive, liver and nervous system disorders [5, 6] . To date, six CoVs have been known to cause human infection [7] . Among them, two zoonotic viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were responsible for serious outbreaks: in China in 2002-2003 [8, 9] Of particular concern, our observations found that all the children were diagnosed after their families, which indicated that they were infected by the household contact. However, after an epidemiological investigation, we found that six adults (42.9%) had a definite or suspicious contact history and six families (42.9%) contacted them were infected, while the other two patients (14.3%) denied any epidemiological history. Among them, the father of case 9 did not contact anyone who came back from Wuhan or Hubei, but also denied contact with any person with respiratory symptoms. At the same time, through official investigations, they did not find that someone was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection on the vehicle he was travelling on, prompting the virus to spread. In addition, from the official information, more and more patients can't find the clue of infection and more and more cluster outbreak showed that no contact, no close communication and even never go out the door. So, we think that these phenomena maybe suggest that: (1) the virus spreads very strongly and the transmission of the virus may not be limited to contact, droplets and airborne transmission, and aerosol transmission may also exist, which was similar to SARS [11] . (2) the virus may be carried asymptomatically after infecting the human body but can infect other people.\nIn China, the SARS outbreak of 2003 is still impressive, because the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak infected 8422 individuals leading to 916 deaths in eight affected areas [12] . During the SARS outbreak, there were less children patients and the symptoms are significantly milder in children than in adults [13] [14] [15] [16] . Similarly, the official data to date suggest that children infected with the SARS-CoV-2 are relatively rare too [17] , and their overall symptoms are significantly mild. The main reasons for this phenomenon may be: (1) the range of activities for children is relatively small, they are mainly infected by their adult families. And, as an RNA virus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus maybe also is prone to mistakes in replication, mutating, and surviving without recognition by the immune system, but can also cause a decline in virulence. So, children are infected with second or third generation or even fourth generation virus and they get milder symptoms; (2) it may be because of differences in the immune responses of children compared to adults. One hypothesis is that the innate immune response, that is the early response that is aimed broadly at groups of pathogens, tends to be more active in children. The innate immune system is the first line of defense against pathogens. Cells in that system respond immediately to foreign invaders. The adaptive immune system, by contrast, learns to recognize specific pathogens, but takes longer to join the battle. If the innate immune response is stronger in children exposed to SARS-CoV-2, they may fight off infection more readily than adults, suffering only mild symptoms. Other coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS, also show this pattern [18] . (3) The number or function of ACE2 receptors in children is not as good as in adults. Recently, one studies had investigated the role of the ACE2 receptor and found that the SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-coronavirus receptor ACE2 and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for entry into target cells [19] . As we know, the distribution of ACE2 receptors in different organs and populations is different. Therefore, it may be that different receptor levels or functions in children and adults lead to different severity of illness. (4) Other reasons: such as children have fewer basic diseases, children smoke less, and children have strong self-healing capabilities and so on.\nCK-MB is an indicator of myocardial injury. In the present study, we found six children and two adults had high CK-MB, which means that SARS-CoV-2 can cause heart injury. It is reported that the main mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced myocardial injury may be the direct injury of virus, the inflammatory storm and the distribution of ACE2 receptor [20] .\nAs human lifestyles change, more and more viruses are spreading across species. Current research confirms that SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted from animals to humans. Like other viruses, the relationship between SARS-CoVs and humans has the following possibilities: (1) the virus disappears for some unknown reasons, such as SARS-CoV. (2) Viruses coexist with humans and have seasonal onsets, such as flu influenza viruses. The first is the best outcome of the current situation, but the second possibility is very large. If, as we analyzed above, many people, especially children with mild or no clinical symptoms carry the virus but do not develop the disease, however, the virus spread very strongly, it may lead to the silent spread of the disease and leading to major losses. Therefore, the Chinese government will face greater risks after school starts and work resumes. And, clinicians, especially pediatricians, need to be vigilant to prevent widespread spread of the disease. Children who have infected family members should be monitored or evaluated and family clustering should be reported to ensure a timely diagnosis.\nIn addition, just before we submit, we found that five of six discharged children returned to the hospital because of positive PCR in their stool, however, their families were all negative. One girl (case 3) didn't return to the hospital but isolated in home because she had mild mental symptoms after discharge. Although positive results cannot confirm there were live virus in the stool or not. However, for insurance of public health, they were admitted to the hospital again to get clinical observation. Interestingly, their onset was later than their families, but the period of positive PCR was longer than adults. We should pay more attention to this phenomenon and study the possible mechanism.\nSeveral important limitations of this study should be noted. First, the size was small. Second, the retrospective study included only of children who were hospitalized in one hospital. But as one of the rare reports in children out Hubei province, it's helpful to improve the ability to recognize patients with mild illness.\nFurther studies with large multi-center samples are needed.\nIn conclusion, by analyzing 23 confirmed cases of COVID-2019 in Jinan, Shandong province, this study's findings indicate that new control measures should include rapid medical assessment and removal of the case from the home, as well as increased awareness of the importance of protective measures after symptom onset. Public health measures such as home isolation should be aimed at minimizing such risk factors when addressing household transmission of serious infections spread through droplet transmission.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-25","authors_x":"Su, Liang; Ma, Xiang; Yu, Huafeng; Zhang, Zhaohua; Bian, Pengfei; Han, Yuling; Sun, Jing; Liu, Yanqin; Yang, Chun; Geng, Jin; Zhang, Zhongfa; Gai, Zhongtao","journal_x":"Emerg Microbes Infect","doi_x":"10.1080\/22221751.2020.1744483","H index_x":null,"section":"Discussion","total_rank":0.0494100295,"risk_factors":["smoking"],"match_indices":[4151],"smoking_count":1,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact","contact"],["surviv"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["investigati","investigati"],[],["outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["retrospective study"],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk"],["range"],[],["asymptomatic"],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],[],[],[],["health","health"],[],[],[],[],["generat","generat"],["factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"188e7ff1e260864c89f266b5597de26d69a84660","title_x":"Clinical trials on drug repositioning for COVID-19 treatment","abstract_x":"Rosa SGV and Santos WC. Clinical trials on drug repositioning for COVID-19 treatment. Rev Panam Salud Publica. 2020;44:e40. ABSTRACT The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on December 2019 about a coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province (China). Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths were reported. Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19. More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19. Hence, we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database.\n The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants' clinical conditions; and utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). It is essential to emphasize that this article only captured trials listed in the clinicaltrials.gov database. We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM).\n Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.","text_body":"We identified 24 clinical trials ( Table 1) , in which 19 studies were at clinical phases 2, 3, or 4. The pharmaceutical interventions found for COVID-19 treatment include human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, oseltamivir, favipiravir, carrimycin, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, thalidomide, vitamin C, pirfenidone, bromhexine, fingolimod, danoprevir, ritonavir, darunavir, cobicistat, lopinavir, xiyanping, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM).\nChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are antimalarial drugs. They have antiviral effects against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), namely by inhibiting virus entry into host cells. Another antiviral mechanism is related to the post-translation alteration of newly synthesized proteins via glycosylation inhibition (12) . Hydroxychloroquine is already being used in clinical trials on acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) treatment (13) . In a recent trial with patients on COVID-19 treatment (14) , 100% of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine in combination with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin were virologically cured comparing with 57.1% in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone, and 12.5% in the control group. Currently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be tested (15, 16) in patients with pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV and chloroquine as preventative medicine for COVID-19, as shown in Table 1 .\nImmunoglobulins are useful in several diseases, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), Kawasaki disease, and in multiple neurological autoimmune disorders refractory to standard immunosuppressive treatments (17) . Broadly neutralizing antibodies can recognize a wide variety of glycoproteins (GPs) in virus surfaces or the protein shell of a non-enveloped virus. However, HIV-1, dengue virus (DENV), influenza viruses, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Ebola virus (EBOV) can mutate superficial GPs in order to evade the antibody response, an obstacle in the development of new therapies against such infections (18) . Trial NCT04261426 (19) is utilizing human immunoglobulin in patients with pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV (Table 1) .\nTwo clinical studies refer to the use of remdesivir in severe (20) or mild (21) respiratory infections by SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of the EBOV RNA-polymerase RNA-dependent (RdRp). Dyer et al. 2019 (22) described preliminary findings of a mortality rate of 33% in 499 patients treated with remdesivir against the EBOV disease in early infection stages. The same authors noted a mortality rate of 75% (almost 1 900 people) of non-treated infected patients during the same epidemic period (22) . Wang et al. 2020 (23) presented data showing that remdesivir is effective against the 2019-nCoV in Vero E6 cells (EC 90 1.76 \u03bcM). The suggested mechanism for remdesivir involves the host cells' post-entry stage (23) .\nArbidol, also known as umifenovir, is approved in Russia and China for the treatment of influenza virus infections; it does not have significant adverse effects and is patented for SARS treatment (24) . As shown in Table 1 , four clinical trials will be conducted for COVID-19 treatment: one with arbidol in comparison with the basic treatment (25) , and the other three studies comparing effects with oseltamivir (26, 27) , lopinavirritonavir (27) , and carrimycin (28) . The arbidol anti-viral mechanism against influenza A and B involves viral fusion inhibition with the targeted membrane, which blocks virus entry into the cell (24) . Oseltamivir is another drug approved for influenza A and B treatment; it inhibits the viral neuraminidase and, consequently, blocks the release of viral particles from host cells, reducing the spread in the respiratory tract (29) . Additionally, the use of oseltamivir was already reported during the COVID-19 epidemic in China, either with or without antibiotics and corticosteroids (30) . Oseltamivir is also used in a clinical trial with multiple combinations with chloroquine and favipiravir (31), a nucleoside analog that is well-known as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug; it has shown (23) an EC 50 of 61.88 \u00b5M against SARS-CoV-2 and low toxicity (CC50 >400 \u00b5M).\nThe lopinavir-ritonavir combination is approved for AIDS treatment in several countries. Both drugs are HIV protease inhibitors, but ritonavir is also a cytochrome P450 and GP inhibitor, a fact that endorses the lopinavir pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activities against HIV (32) . Such a combination, plus b-1b interferon, is in phase 2 for the MERS treatment (33) . Several trials involve lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in comparison with the use of other drugs for COVID-19: (26, 27) , carrimycin (28) , TCM (34, 35) , xiyanping (36, 37) , danoprevir-ritonavir (38) and interferon inhalation (34, 38) . Nevertheless, one previous article argued that in a clinical trial with 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the lopinavir-ritonavir combination was not associated with clinical improvement comparing with standard care procedures (39) .\nCarrimycin is a macrolide antibiotic with effects against some gram-positive bacteria and in vitro effects on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (40) .\nDanoprevir is an HCV NS3 protease inhibitor approved in China for the treatment of non-cirrhotic genotype 1b chronic hepatitis C, in combination with ritonavir, peginterferon-a, and ribavirin (41) .\nTraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) uses phytotherapeutic formulations such as teas, pills, powders or tinctures, and cultural components that originated 5000 years ago in Chinese medicine (42) . TCMs were already used for SARS-CoV infection in 2002 as coadjuvant therapy with the enhancement of patients' symptoms, increased oxyhemoglobin arterial saturation; they proved useful in the early stages of this infection (42) .\nInterferons (IFNs) are proteins that bind to cellular surfaces' receptors and initiate JAK-STAT signaling cascades, with transcriptional regulation of genes controlled by interferons and effects against some viruses like hepatitis B virus and HCV (43) .\nXiyanping is a TCM preparation with andrographolide as a principal component; it has significant antibacterial and antiviral effects (44) .\nDarunavir, in combination with cobicistat, will be used in trial number NCT04252274 (45) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently approves such a combination in AIDS treatment. Darunavir is another HIV protease inhibitor, and cobicistat, like ritonavir, is a booster for enhancing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of darunavir by cytochrome P450 (CYP3A) inhibition (46, 47) .\nRecombinant human interferon a2b is described to have inhibitory effects on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (48) , and the purpose of the clinical trials found for this paper is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human interferon a2b in treating patients with new coronavirus infection (49) .\nThalidomide will be used in two trials against COVID-19 (49, 50) . Thalidomide has an anti-inflammatory action due to its ability to speed up the degradation of messenger RNA in blood cells and thus reduce tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa). Furthermore, thalidomide can increase the secretion of interleukins, such as IL-12, and activate natural killer cells (51) .\nThe corticosteroid methylprednisolone will be tested against COVID-19 (52). Long et al. 2016 (53) reported that corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone) is beneficial in treating SARS-CoV patients; it significantly prolongs the survival time of clinical cases. Nevertheless, other authors described the use of corticosteroids in the early stages of SARS infection with increasing values of viral load (54) . Furthermore, studies with corticosteroids in the adjuvant therapy of MERS-CoV infection were unable to prove efficacy because all patients died (55) . Methylprednisolone has already been used in COVID-19 patients in combination with antibiotics, oseltamivir, and oxygen therapy (56) .\nFinally, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), pirfenidone, bevacizumab, fingolimod, and bromhexine hydrochloride are going to be tested on COVID-19 (57) (58) (59) (60) (61) . Vitamin C has antioxidant activity and may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation (57, 62) , effects that improve vasopressor synthesis, enhance immune cell function, improve endovascular function, and provide epigenetic immunologic modifications. Clinical trials have demonstrated promising data on mortality improvement in sepsis, but more extensive studies are necessary to validate these conclusions (63) . Pirfenidone has been used in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diseases due to anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, namely by inhibiting IL-1b and IL-4 (58) . Trial NCT04282902 claimed (58) that anti-inflammatory effects may be helpful in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (59, 63) , and it may reduce the levels of VEGF caused by hypoxia, severe inflammation, and upregulation of the infected respiratory tract epithelium, all of which might suppress the edema in patients with COVID-19 (63) . Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor regulator (FTY720) with an effective immunology modulator that is useful in multiple sclerosis (60) . According to some pathological findings of pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation, the use of immune modulators, together with ventilator support, should be considered for severe patients to prevent the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Study NCT04280588 aims to determine the efficacy of fingolimod for COVID-19 (60). Bromhexine is a transmembrane protease serine inhibitor; such a protease is responsible for the activation of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV for viral entry through the plasma membrane (61, 64) . One study (60) will evaluate the efficacy of bromhexine combined with standard treatment\/standard treatment in patients with COVID-19.\nIn conclusion, the WHO declared an epidemic of pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. In this review, we found 24 clinical trials that have already started with the repositioning of more than 20 medicines for COVID-19 treatment, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, oseltamivir, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and TCM. The Hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination was the first drug repurposed with excellent results in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2, but further, more extended studies, with a higher number of patients, are needed to confirm these results. Besides its limitations, repositioning clinical trials are still an attractive strategy: they may facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they may reduce the costs and time to reach the market; there is an existing pharmaceutical supply chain for formulation and distribution; and there is the possibility of combinations with other drugs in treatments that are more effective than monotherapy. Most of the studies found in this article are scheduled to end in 2020, and we hope these repositioning trials may help to find solutions for COVID-19 treatment by this year.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-20","authors_x":"Rosa, Sandro G.

However, disease severity following SARS-and MERS-CoV corresponded strongly to underlying host conditions including age, biological sex, and overall health [22] . Early patient reports from 2019-nCoV find similar trends. Severe illness with 2019-nCoV has been associated with elderly patients (>60 years old), including twenty-six lethal cases. These findings correspond to increased severity and death in people over the age of 50 following both SARS and MERS-CoV infection [23, 24] . Similarly, the underlying health of the patient likely plays a critical role in overall susceptibility. For the 2019-nCoV, limited comorbidity data is available; however, the twenty-six patients that have succumbed to the novel CoV had significant health conditions including hypertension, diabetes, heart and\/or kidney function issues that may have made them more susceptible. For the MERS-CoV outbreak, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and\/or other chronic illnesses have been present in the majority of deaths and correspond to findings in animal models [25] .

It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations supported by high-level evidence.","text_body":"Apart from the timely diagnosis of cases, the achievement of favorable clinical outcomes depends on the timely treatment administered. ACE2 has been reported to be the same cell entry receptor used by 2019-nCoV to infect humans as SARS-CoV [113] . Hence, clinical similarity between the two viruses is expected, particularly in severe cases. In addition, most of those who have died from MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV were advance in age and had underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease that compromised their immune systems [114] . Coronaviruses have error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP), which result in frequent mutations and recombination events. This results in quasispecies diversity that is closely associated with adaptive evolution and the capacity to enhance viral-cell entry to cause disease over time in a specific population at-risk [115] . Since ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, coronaviruses are likely to infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and this may influence the type of therapeutics against 2019-nCoV, similarly to SAR-CoV.\nHowever, in the years following two major coronavirus outbreaks SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012, there remains no consensus on the optimal therapy for either disease [116, 117] . Well-designed clinical trials that provide the gold standard for assessing the therapeutic measures are scarce. No coronavirus protease inhibitors have successfully completed a preclinical development program despite large efforts exploring SARS-CoV inhibitors. The bulk of potential therapeutic strategies remain in the experimental phase, with only a handful crossing the in vitro hurdle. Stronger efforts are required in the research for treatment options for major coronaviruses given their pandemic potential. Effective treatment options are essential to maximize the restoration of affected populations to good health following infections. Clinical trials have commenced in China to identify effective treatments for 2019-nCoV based on the treatment evidence from SARS and MERS. There is currently no effective specific antiviral with high-level evidence; any specific antiviral therapy should be provided in the context of a clinical study\/trial. Few treatments have shown real curative action against SARS and MERS and the literature generally describes isolated cases or small case series.\nMany interferons from the three classes have been tested for their antiviral activities against SARS-CoV both in vitro and in animal models. Interferon \u03b2 has consistently been shown to be the most active, followed by interferon \u03b1. The use of corticosteroids with interferon alfacon-1 (synthetic interferon \u03b1) appeared to have improved oxygenation and faster resolution of chest radiograph abnormalities in observational studies with untreated controls. Interferon has been used in multiple observational studies to treat SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV patients [116, 117] . Interferons, with or without ribavirin, and lopinavir\/ritonavir are most likely to be beneficial and are being trialed in China for 2019-nCoV. This drug treatment appears to be the most advanced. Timing of treatment is likely an important factor in effectiveness. A combination of ribavirin and lopinavir\/ritonavir was used as a post-exposure prophylaxis in health care workers and may have reduced the risk of infection. Ribavirin alone is unlikely to have substantial antiviral activities at clinically used dosages. Hence, ribavirin with or without corticosteroids and with lopinavir and ritonavir are among the combinations employed. This was the most common agent reported in the available literature. Its efficacy has been assessed in observational studies, retrospective case series, retrospective cohort study, a prospective observational study, a prospective cohort study and randomized controlled trial ranging from seven to 229 participants [117] . Lopinavir\/ritonavir (Kaletra) was the earliest protease inhibitor combination introduced for the treatment of SARS-CoV. Its efficacy was documented in several studies, causing notably lower incidence of adverse outcomes than with ribavirin alone. Combined usage with ribavirin was also associated with lower incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, nosocomial infection and death, amongst other favorable outcomes. Recent in vitro studies have shown another HIV protease inhibitor, nelfinavir, to have antiviral capacity against SARS-CoV, although it has yet to show favorable outcomes in animal studies [118] . Remdesivir (Gilead Sciences, GS-5734) nucleoside analogue in vitro and in vivo data support GS-5734 development as a potential pan-coronavirus antiviral based on results against several coronaviruses (CoVs), including highly pathogenic CoVs and potentially emergent BatCoVs. The use of remdesivir may be a good candidate as an investigational treatment.\nImproved mortality following receipt of convalescent plasma in various doses was consistently reported in several observational studies involving cases with severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) of viral etiology. A significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following treatment of 0.25 compared to placebo or no therapy was observed [119] . Studies were however at moderate to high risk of bias given their small sample sizes, allocation of treatment based on the physician's discretion, and the availability of plasma. Factors like concomitant treatment may have also confounded the results. Associations between convalescent plasma and hospital length of stay, viral antibody levels, and viral load respectively were similarly inconsistent across available literature. Convalescent plasma, while promising, is likely not yet feasible, given the limited pool of potential donors and issues of scalability. Monoclonal antibody treatment is progressing. SARS-CoV enters host cells through the binding of their spike (S) protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD209L [118] . Human monoclonal antibodies to the S protein have been shown to significantly reduce the severity of lung pathology in non-human primates following MERS-CoV infection [120] . Such neutralizing antibodies can be elicited by active or passive immunization using vaccines or convalescent plasma respectively. While such neutralizing antibodies can theoretically be harvested from individuals immunized with vaccines, there is uncertainty over the achievement of therapeutic levels of antibodies.\nOther therapeutic agents have also been reported. A known antimalarial agent, chloroquine, elicits antiviral effects against multiple viruses including HIV type 1, hepatitis B and HCoV-229E. Chloroquine is also immunomodulatory, capable of suppressing the production and release of factors which mediate the inflammatory complications of viral diseases (tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6) [121] . It is postulated that chloroquine works by altering ACE2 glycosylation and endosomal pH. Its anti-inflammatory properties may be beneficial for the treatment of SARS. Niclosamide as a known drug used in antihelminthic treatment. The efficacy of niclosamide as an inhibitor of virus replication was proven in several assays. In both immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence assays, niclosamide treatment was observed to completely inhibit viral antigen synthesis. Reduction of virus yield in infected cells was dose dependent. Niclosamide likely does not interfere in the early stages of virus attachment and entry into cells, nor does it function as a protease inhibitor. Mechanisms of niclosamide activity warrant further investigation [122] . Glycyrrhizin also reportedly inhibits virus adsorption and penetration in the early steps of virus replication. Glycyrrhizin was a significantly potent inhibitor with a low selectivity index when tested against several pathogenic flaviviruses. While preliminary results suggest production of nitrous oxide (which inhibits virus replication) through induction of nitrous oxide synthase, the mechanism of Glycyrrhizin against SARS-CoV remains unclear. The compound also has relatively lower toxicity compared to protease inhibitors like ribavirin [123] . Inhibitory activity was also detected in baicalin [124] , extracted from another herb used in the treatment of SARS in China and Hong Kong. Findings on these compounds are limited to in vitro studies [121] [122] [123] [124] .\nDue to the rapidly evolving situation of the 2019-nCoV, there will be potential limitations to the systematic review. The systematic review is likely to have publication bias as some developments have yet to be reported while for other developments there is no intention to report publicly (or in scientific platforms) due to confidentiality concerns. However, this may be limited to only a few developments for review as publicity does help in branding to some extent for the company and\/or the funder. Furthermore, due to the rapid need to share the status of these developments, there may be reporting bias in some details provided by authors of the scientific articles or commentary articles in traditional media. Lastly, while it is not viable for any form of quality assessment and metaanalysis of the selected articles due to the limited data provided and the heterogeneous style of reporting by different articles, this paper has provided a comprehensive overview of the potential developments of these pharmaceutical interventions during the early phase of the outbreak. This systematic review would be useful for cross-check when the quality assessment and meta-analysis of these developments are performed as a follow-up study.","publish_time_x":"2020","authors_x":"Pang, Junxiong; Wang, Min Xian; Ang, Ian Yi Han; Tan, Sharon Hui Xuan; Lewis, Ruth Frances; Chen, Jacinta I.

Health professionals are of no exception as they have the duty of care to the infected patients, close contacts with patients' families\/ relatives, and sometimes, facing the public enquiry [11] . Confirmed and suspected cases of the COVID-19 may experience fear of severe disease consequences and the contagion [11] . Consequently, they may experience loneliness, denial, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and despair, which may lower treatment adherence. Some of these cases may even have increased risk of aggression and suicide. Suspected isolated cases may suffer from anxiety due to uncertainty about their health status and develop obsessive-compulsive symptoms, such as repeated temperature check and sterilization. Further, strict quarantine and mandatory contact tracing policy by health authorities could cause societal rejection, financial loss, discrimination, and stigmatization [12, 13] . The limited knowledge of the COVID-19 and the overwhelming news may lead to anxiety and fear in the public [12, 14] . The public at large may also experience boredom, disappointment, and irritability under the isolation measures [13] .\nFrontline health professionals, especially those in Wuhan, have close contact with infected patients. Excessive workload, isolation, and discrimination are frequently reported [15] and thus, they are highly vulnerable to experiencing physical exhaustion, fear, emotion disturbance, and sleep problems [15] . A recent study involving 1,563 health professionals found that more than half (50.7%) of the participants reported depressive symptoms, 44.7% anxiety, and 36.1% sleep disturbance [16] .\nPatients with severe mental illness (SMI) are inevitably affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. In early February, 2020, over 40 inpatients in Wuhan Mental Health Center were diagnosed with the COVID-19 [17] . As of 18 th February, 2020, a total of 323 patients with SMI have been infected [17] . In-patients, especially those requiring long-term hospitalization in closed wards, may experience fear of high risk of cluster contagion. Due to traffic restrictions and isolation measures, outpatients with SMI are facing difficulties to receive maintenance treatment, and may thus end up with mental relapse and uncontrollable behaviors (e.g., hyperactivity, agitation, and selfharm) [18] . Patients with chronic diseases (e.g., chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and cardiocerebrovascular diseases), however, also need medical follow-up in hospitals regularly. These patients may also have difficulties to obtain maintenance treatment. As such, these preventive measures may lead to diminished physical wellbeing which exacerbates increased risk of negative feelings and suicidality. Families of deceased patients may suffer from bereavement and grief. The rapid transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 will increase the likelihood of mental distress and psychiatric morbidities in different sub-populations, not simply attributed to persistent quarantine and massive negative news portrayal, but also influenced by the growing number of confirmed and suspected cases, and death in China and the globe on a daily basis.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-15","authors_x":"Li, Wen; Yang, Yuan; Liu, Zi-Han; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Zhang, Qinge; Zhang, Ling; Cheung, Teris; Xiang, Yu-Tao","journal_x":"Int J Biol Sci","doi_x":"10.7150\/ijbs.45120","H index_x":null,"section":"Mental health issues during the COVID-19 outbreak","total_rank":0.1173380035,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[2550],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact","contact","contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk","risk"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["health","Health","health","health","health","health","Health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"091ddd7ed4beb435544601f4642da63e60375ef7","title_x":"Progression of Mental Health Services during the COVID-19 Outbreak in China","abstract_x":"The novel coronavirus disease ","text_body":"In order to reduce the risk of negative psychological outcomes caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and promote social stability, the National Health Commission of China (NHC) has integrated psychological crisis intervention into the general deployment of disease prevention.

The mental health-related national associations and academic societies are required to adopt emergency psychological crisis interventions, psychological counseling and establish psychological assistance expert groups to provide professional guidance and coordinate with health authorities.\nFollowing the aforementioned Principle, mental health associations and academic societies have organized expert teams, published guidelines and instructions for mental health services, such as the 'Psychosomatic Health Service Intervention Plan for the Prevention and Control of New Coronavirus Infection and Pneumonia (draft)' [20] , and the 'Manual of National Mental Health of the New Coronavirus Pneumonia outbreak' [21] . Online educational articles\/videos are also released to the public, e.g., the article entitled 'Public Psychological Self-help Guideline for Pneumonitis with New Coronavirus Infection' [22] , the series of 'New Coronavirus Science Popularization Knowledge' [23] , the 'Online Lessons of Psychological Intervention during the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Outbreak' [24] , and videos on 'Psychological Responses in the Fight Against New Crown Pneumonia' [25] . The NHC also released the 'Psychological Adjustment Guidelines for Coping with the New Coronavirus Pneumonia' for specific populations, including older adults, children and adolescents, pregnant women and health professionals [26] ( Table 1 ). In addition, mental health professionals in Wuhan have established expert consensus on psychological crisis intervention and uploaded videos of mental health education for the general public through WeChat and other internet platforms at the early stage of the outbreak [27, 28] . [55] According to the Principle, psychological crisis interventions include three key points: 1) understanding the mental health status in different populations influenced by the COVID-19 outbreak; 2) identifying people who are at high risk of suicide and aggression, and 3) providing appropriate psychological interventions for those in need. Target populations are categorized in four levels: Level 1 population includes those who are most vulnerable to mental health problems, such as hospitalized patients with confirmed infection or severe physical condition, frontline health professionals and administrative staff. Level 2 population includes isolated patients with atypical infection symptoms (e.g., close contacts and patients with suspected infection) and patients at fever clinics. Level 3 population includes those individuals with close contacts in level 1 and 2, i.e., family members, colleagues, friends, and rear rescuers (organizational managers and volunteers) who participated in the COVID-epidemic response. Level 4 population includes people who are affected by the epidemic prevention and control measures, susceptible people, and the public.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-15","authors_x":"Li, Wen; Yang, Yuan; Liu, Zi-Han; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Zhang, Qinge; Zhang, Ling; Cheung, Teris; Xiang, Yu-Tao","journal_x":"Int J Biol Sci","doi_x":"10.7150\/ijbs.45120","H index_x":null,"section":"Instructions and guidelines for mental health services during the COVID-19 outbreak","total_rank":0.1169284468,"risk_factors":["pregnancy"],"match_indices":[2095],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":1,"has_pregnancy?":true,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact","contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak","outbreak","Outbreak","outbreak","outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk"],[],[],[],["Infecti","Infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age","age"],[],[],["Health","health","health","health","health","health","health","Health","Health","health","health","health","health","health","health"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"0212e200dc708984bda32b474aa6a1437c6a3c3d","title_x":"Risks of Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in Preg- nancy; a Narrative Review","abstract_x":"Introduction: The outbreak of the new Coronavirus in China in December 2019 and subsequently in various countries around the world has raised concerns about the possibility of vertical transmission of the virus from mother to fetus.","text_body":"Coronaviruses are among the main human and animal pathogens (1) .

Of the 37 pregnant mothers, 7 reported preterm labor at 30-33 weeks of age and the rest had no preterm labor and all had delivery in the third trimester (between 34 and 40 weeks' gestation). Only one study reported that the neonate died after birth. Of the 37 mothers, 6 had preterm labor, 6 had premature rupture of the membrane, 2 had abnormal amniotic fluid, and 2 had abnormal umbilical cord. None of the mothers needed mechanical ventilation after delivery and only received antiviral, antibiotic, and oxygen therapy through the nasal catheter. Only one parturient woman required ICU admission and oxygen through the Venturi mask and her neonate was admitted to the NICU ward for monitoring. The most common infected mothers' symptoms were fever, cough, and chest pain. On admission, the lungs of all mothers were normal, but chest CT scan reported unilateral and bilateral infiltrations. Out of the 37 studied mothers, 2 had clinical manifestations of COVID-19 during delivery, 2 showed symptoms after delivery and the rest of them had symptoms of COVID-19 during hospitalization and prenatal delivery. Chest CT scan was performed for all of them and the most commonly reported finding was ground glass opacity (GGO) with progressive to consolidations. In 35 mothers, chest CT scan before and after delivery revealed no changes, in four postpartum women chest CT scan results had improved and in one patient it had exacerbated. The most common laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia. No antiviral medications were given to mothers during pregnancy. All of the studied women gave birth to a healthy baby, with an Apgar score of 8-10. No amniotic fluid abnormality, cyanosis, asphyxia, abortion, or congenital abnormalities at birth were reported.

In this regard, a study by Chen et al. in China on 9 pregnant mothers with COVID-19 found that none of the newborns had postpartum complications such as COVID-19 infection and prematurity (12) . This finding is in line with the results of a previous study on SARS-CoV-1 that was done by Wong and colleagues (15) . However, acourding to some studies, infection with COVID-19 during pregnancy can cause complications for both the mother and the fetus; including preterm delivery, respiratory distress, fetal distress, coaglopathy accompanied by liver dysfunction and death of the mother. The newborn and the mother with confirmed COVID-19 should be isolated in different rooms and be screened very carefully (4, 7, 21, 23) . Also, according to Chen et al., the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women were not significantly different from those of non-pregnant women, with common symptoms including chest pain, shortness of breath, fever and lethargy (12) . Also, Liu et al. found that Pregnancy and childbirth did not aggravate the course of symptoms or CT features of COVID-19 Pneumonia (16) . Overall, due to lack of evidence, scientists and researchers could not confirm vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from placenta, during delivery and breast milk in the perinatal period (17) . In some studies, evaluating both cesarean and normal vaginal delivery in mothers with COVID-19 showed that neither type of delivery affected their newborns and all of the studied newborns were negative for COVID-19 infection (12, 15, 16, 24) . Previously published studies have demonstrated that being affected with SARS during perinatal period is associated with a high prevalence of harmful maternal and neonatal side effects including disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, abrupt abortion, preterm childbirth, intrauterine growth retard, neonatal intubation and need of newborn to be admitted to neonatal intensive care unit, and organ failure (17, 25) . Generally, our review of literature showed that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and their newborns had less problems than would be anticipated for those with SARS-CoV-1 infection. Although the findings should be interpreted with percaution because of the small sample size, the results are mostly in line with the findings by Zhu and colleagues (24) that was done on ten newborn who were born to mothers with COVID-19 pneumonia. Also, the clinical manifastations reported in pregnant women with positive COVID-19 are similar to those reported for non-pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and relatively good clinical outcomes have been reported for COVID-19 infection in pregnant women compared with SARS-CoV-1 infection (26, 27) .

The rapid spread of this virus across the world in only 2 months highlights the transmissibility of this family of viruses and the significant morbidity and mortality that they can cause. We highlight the current state of knowledge of coronavirus biology while answering questions concerning the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.","text_body":"U ntil the very end of 2019, there were six coronaviruses known to cause disease in humans. Four of these result in little more than a common cold and are endemic around the world. The viruses known as human coronavirus (hCoV)-229E, hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-OC43 are of little concern at a global public health level. The other two, however, have caused more widespread concern. In 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in the human population. In a matter of months, this virus from a bat that transmitted via a palm civet to infect a human in the Guangdong province of China infected over 8,000 people, killing roughly 10% (1) . In 2003, SARS-CoV infections stopped, and the virus has not been seen since. A second epidemic coronavirus, known as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in 2012. Like the SARS-CoV outbreak, MERS-CoV started with a patient suffering pneumonia and came from a zoonotic event (this time from a bat via a camel to a human) (1) . However, MERS-CoV has shown far more limited human-to-human transmission than SARS-CoV. Since 2012, there have been roughly 2,500 cases of MERS-CoV, mostly confined to regions of the Middle East. While case numbers are low for MERS-CoV, there is a high case fatality ratio (CFR) of approximately 35%, making this virus one of the deadliest human pathogens. Coronaviruses that infect humans all appear to have respiratory transmission, making them pathogens of pandemic potential. The end of 2019 saw the emergence of a novel human coronavirus that is rapidly spreading around the global and has a higher degree of lethality than the endemic coronaviruses, though not to the level of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. The virus was initially named 2019-nCoV but is now termed SARS-CoV-2 and causes the disease COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). At the time of writing, there have been over 115,000 cases and over 4,000 deaths.\nThe first case of COVID-19 was reported to the WHO by Chinese authorities on 31 December 2019 as a result of a patient suffering pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. Over the following days, more patients were suspected to be suffering the same disease, and by 9 January, a novel coronavirus had been detected and the sequence was published online shortly thereafter (2). The 2 months since emergence of SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated the rapid pace at which a virus can spread and which science can develop. After an initial lag phase, cases of COVID-19 followed a closely exponential curve. The vast majority of cases are, at the time of writing, still from mainland China. However, over 100 other countries have reported cases. Most cases outside China have been associated with travel to that country, but more clusters of cases are now being detected without travel history. In this article, we will discuss what has already been learned about the virus and will then outline 10 key questions and directions of study for this novel coronavirus.\nSARS-CoV-2 virology. The novel virus is in the Coronaviridae family and therefore shares common features of this family. Coronaviruses have large (\u03f330-kb) singlestranded, positive-sense RNA genomes. The genome can be roughly divided into a 5= two-thirds and a 3= third. The first two-thirds of the genome code for two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab from ORF1a and ORF1b) which are proteolytically cleaved into the nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to -16) that are essential for production of new viral genetic material. The remainder of the genome codes for the structural proteins and carries the accessory genes that produce virions and alter the host response, respectively (1) .\nAs the naming may suggest, the newly emerged coronavirus is closely related to SARS-CoV, sharing roughly 80% identity at a nucleotide level. The closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a virus found in bats known as RaTG13-2013 (96% identity), suggesting that, similarly to SARS-CoV, the virus entered the human population from a spillover event either directly from a bat or through an animal intermediate (3). Early studies on SARS-CoV-2 have shown further similarities with its namesake virus in that the spike protein utilizes ACE2 as its cell surface receptor (3, 4). ACE2 is found on ciliated epithelial cells of the human lungs, and this receptor utilization influences the tropism of these viruses.\nBased on the speed at which the outbreak of COVID-19 has developed, SARS-CoV-2 appears to spread easily in the human population. Many health care workers have been infected, and more clusters of cases are being detected with each passing day. The reproductive number (R 0 ) of the virus is currently thought to be around 3 (5), again suggesting the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission that appears to be through respiratory droplets and potentially a fecal-oral route (6) .\nWhile much can be gleaned from our general understanding of coronavirus biology and some of the early studies on SARS-CoV-2, many pertinent questions exist, for which we will outline 10 here.\n(i) What is the animal reservoir\/intermediate host?\nThe bat virus termed RaTG13-2013 has 96% identity with SARS-CoV-2 (3), strongly pointing toward a shared common ancestor and suggesting that the novel human pathogen originated in bats. When the zoonoses first occurred remains an interesting question. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV also have common ancestry with viruses found in bats. Both of these viruses had an intermediate host for transmission into humans, these being palm civets and camels for SARS-and MERS-CoV, respectively (1). There has been a suggestion that pangolins may be the intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 (7), but this remains to be established. Knowing the intermediate host is an important step for understanding how SARS-CoV-2 became a human virus and how to potentially curtail further spillover events. Knowing that MERS-CoV transmits to humans via dromedary camels has allowed for the development of a camel vaccine to potentially limit spread to humans (8, 9) . Approval for novel vaccines in animal hosts is far easier than in humans. Moreover, knowing the intermediate host allows for measures to be taken to limit human contact with the animal (e.g., not selling meat from these animals in wet food markets), which can again help reduce the chances of future spillover events. However, with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 being so extensive, whether these measures would be effective at limiting human cases of COVID-19 may be unlikely.\n(ii) What is the true case count (mild symptoms\/asymptomatic carriers) and lethality? Since the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, the case fatality ratio (CFR) has been around 2% to 4%. This is a much lower CFR than those seen for SARS and MERS, which are around 10% and 35%, respectively. However, many people remain in severe conditions in hospitals as a result of COVID-19, which could see the CFR increase. With that said, the true burden of disease in the human population is currently unknown. A recent report on approximately 44,000 Chinese patients showed that 81% develop only mild symptoms, while 14% develop severe symptoms and 5% become critically ill (10) . This study suggests that even among the people with symptoms severe enough to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, there can still be mild symptoms, which may suggest that many other people have symptoms mild enough to not require testing. This would make the true case count far larger and, by extension, the CFR lower. Early estimates suggested that the true case count may be as much as 10 times higher than was being reported (11) . Establishing the true disease burden in the human population will take time and retrospective serological survey and is a secondary aspect in relation to controlling the current disease outbreak. But it remains an interesting question to be determined moving forward.\n(iii) What comorbidities are associated with severe disease outcome and how do these affect viral pathogenesis? As more cases of COVID-19 occur, it is becoming established that the most severe cases and mortality are associated with underlying health conditions. The most common associated comorbidities are pulmonary disease, diabetes, and old age (10) . Interesting questions as to how these comorbidities impact viral pathogenesis are open for investigation. More severe SARS cases were also associated with age, and work in mice has demonstrated this (12) (13) (14) . Severe MERS is associated with diabetes and other underlying health conditions (15, 16) , and again, work in mice has shown that diabetes can impact the immune response to infection, leading to increased pathogenesis (17) . It will be interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is similarly impacted.\n(iv) Can spread of SARS-CoV-2 be contained\/will the virus persist in the human population? Four of the seven human coronaviruses are endemic around the world but cause little more than the common cold. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 is a global epidemic, with the potential to be considered a pandemic. In one scenario, this outbreak may be contained, and the virus never seen again, like SARS-CoV. Alternatively, the virus may become an endemic virus with seasonality like influenza and the other human coronaviruses. However, it is too early to know whether SARS-CoV-2 spread will be affected by changing weather conditions. Nearly all cases of COVID-19 have been in China, where it is winter; whether cases will decrease as temperatures increase in the Northern Hemisphere, as is seen for influenza, remains to be seen.\n(v) What in vitro and in vivo systems can be used for research? A very important question for understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection is what systems can be used for study. Early studies on SARS-CoV-2 determined that the cellular receptor for the virus is ACE2, similarly to SARS-CoV (3). This knowledge helps to develop an understanding of susceptibility of certain in vitro cell lines to infection with the novel virus. The likelihood is that if cells were not permissive for growth of SARS-CoV, they probably will not support growth of SARS-CoV-2. As more labs around the world start researching the new virus, a better understanding of the permissive cell lines will be developed, an important step to testing therapeutic options and developing a better understanding of basic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 virology. The more challenging aspect of lab-based research on the novel human coronavirus will be developing small-animal models. The early research on receptor usage suggests the virus is not able to infect cells expressing mouse ACE2 (3), thus making a mouse model potentially challenging. Whether expression of human ACE2 in mouse lungs using adenovirus or mouse adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 can develop appropriate models, as was done for SARS-CoV (18) , is a pressing question. Whether other small-animal models can be used also needs to be investigated. These models will be essential for thoroughly testing therapeutic candidates and vaccine strategies and understanding the pathology of disease.\n(vi) Can we find therapeutic options? As the case count and death toll of the epidemic continue to increase, it becomes imperative to identify therapeutic options for COVID-19. Once in vitro and in vivo systems have been established, these tests can proceed. Drug repurposing may prove to be the best strategy for quick development of novel therapeutic options. A novel therapeutic being tested is remdesivir (19, 20) , which in combination with chloroquine has been found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 growth in vitro (21) . It was recently announced by the NIH that remdesivir would be entering phase 3 clinical trials in humans. Chloroquine has also been reported to be effective in patients in China (22) . A combination of lopinavir and ritonavir is also under investigation in human cases of COVID-19 in China. Many more people will need to be treated with these drugs to determine true efficacy, but they are promising leads.\n(vii) Can a vaccination strategy be developed? An effective strategy to contain virus spread is vaccination. During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks, much research went into developing vaccine strategies (23) . However, the cessation of the SARS epidemic and the minimal human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV have curtailed the testing of these interventions in humans. With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, a new impetus into development of coronavirus vaccines has been generated. There are several platforms being used to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, including spike subunit, DNA, RNA, whole-virion, and nanoparticle vaccines. Future testing in cells and animal models will determine which is most likely to be successful in humans.\n(viii) What is the host response to SARS-CoV-2 and pathology of COVID-19? After an initial push to look for therapeutic and vaccine options to help treat and prevent COVID-19, it will be important to better understand the host response to infection and the pathology of disease. A prerequisite step will of course be the development of appropriate animal models. Better understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 causes pathology and the way in which the host responds may help direct further therapeutic avenues. Understanding how comorbidities such as diabetes impact the host response to infection will also be important to better understand COVID-19.\n(ix) Why does SARS-CoV-2 appear to spread more rapidly than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV in the human population? Compared to the two other highly pathogenic coronaviruses that have emerged in the 21st century, SARS-CoV-2 appears to spread very well in the human population. Why this is the case will be interesting to understand. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 appear to use the same cell receptor of ACE2, suggesting a similar tropism, yet the novel coronavirus appears to spread much more efficiently simply based on the number of cases and the speed at which they have emerged. Whether proteolytic cleavage sites, such as a furin site in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, influence this will be important to determine for this outbreak and for the next. There are many other coronaviruses that have been found in bats that have potential for spread in the human population (24) (25) (26) . Developing an understanding of the difference in the dynamics of spread between SARS-CoV-2 and the other coronaviruses will provide insights to understand which viruses may pose the most threat for zoonotic transmission and mass spread in the human population, leading to the final question. . . (x) What will be the next coronavirus to enter the human population? The past 18 years have seen the emergence of three novel coronaviruses that have caused significant morbidity and mortality in the human population. Continued surveillance of viruses in animal populations and understanding the factors that influence zoonotic events are essential for attempts to limit future outbreaks.\nConclusion. The year 2020 has started with a rapid, global epidemic of the virus SARS-CoV-2, causing the disease COVID-19. The virus appears to have transmitted to humans in a zoonotic event from bats. There are many questions to investigate regarding all aspects of SARS-CoV-2 virology and epidemiology. These questions range from how the virus emerged to how it spreads and how the disease manifests. But most pressingly as the global outbreak continues to grow, can we develop effective vaccine and therapeutic strategies to treat not only this epidemic but any future coronavirus spillover events?","publish_time_x":"2020-03-18","authors_x":"Weston, Stuart; Frieman, Matthew B.","journal_x":"mSphere","doi_x":"10.1128\/msphere.00203-20","H index_x":19.0,"section":"","total_rank":0.0248138958,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[8234,8510,8608,13311],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":4,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],["contact"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["investigati","investigati"],["model","model","model","model","model","model","model"],["outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak","outbreak"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],["range"],[],["asymptomatic"],["infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti","infecti"],["reproducti"],["route"],["age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],["health","health","health","health"],[],[],[],[],["generat"],["factor"],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"b741ebc747e054216b184b572bbe130bb9d772bd","title_x":"Covid 19 pandemic and gynaecological laparoscopic surgery: knowns and unknowns","abstract_x":"The worldwide impact of COVID 19 continues to be felt as hospitals in all countries reduce elective and nonurgent cases to allow staffing and resources to be deployed elsewhere.

AGPs can create a risk of airborne transmission of infections that are usually only spread by droplet transmission. Due to the high viral load in respiratory secretions, intubation and extubation remain one of the highest risk AGPs (Meng et al., 2020) . The main at-risk healthcare professionals are thus anaesthetists and emergency department clinicians and guidance is available in the wider literature to safeguard these clinicians and reduce transmission risks (Wong et al., 2020) . Many emergency laparoscopic procedures will still be required during this pandemic, however very little is known regarding the risks to the health care professions undertaking these procedures. The aim of this paper is to review all the up to date evidence, including experiences from China and Italy and extrapolated data from previous outbreaks, to guide the safe management of suspected and positive COVID 19 patients when undergoing gynaecological procedures.\nIn laparoscopic surgery, the creation of an artificial pneumoperitoneum may increase the risk of aerosol exposure to the whole operating team. Specific evidence relating to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the peritoneal cavity and thus its transmission during laparoscopic surgery is lacking, but theoretical risks may be extrapolated from previous pandemics and viral infections. For example, prior to COVID 19, previous studies have shown that other pathogens such as activated corynebacterium, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been detected in surgical smoke (Capizzi et al., 1998 , Hensman et al., 1998 , Johnson and Robinson 1991 , Alp et al., 2006 .\nThe presence of HPV DNA has been reported in approximately 40% of smoke plumes following loop excision biopsy of the cervix (Sood et al., 1994 ). An analysis of surgical smoke in HBV positive patients undergoing operative laparoscopic procedures, found the presence of HBV in over 90% of cases (Kwak et al., 2016) . The risk of disease spread therefore theoretically exists with surgical smoke, however actual documented cases are rare with only 4 confirmed cases of HPV transmission documented in the wider literature (Liu et al., 2019) . No cases of HIV or HBV transmission have been documented (Bree et al., 2017) . However the presence of these pathogens are not an absolute contraindications to laparoscopic surgery as long as universal infection control precautions are undertaken (Diettrich and Kaplan 1991, Eubanks et al., 1993) .","publish_time_x":"2020-04-01","authors_x":"Mallick, R; Odejinmi, F; Clark, TJ","journal_x":null,"doi_x":null,"H index_x":null,"section":"Viral transmission in surgically generated smoke and aerosols","total_rank":0.1449275362,"risk_factors":["smoking"],"match_indices":[1840,2006,2110,2328],"smoking_count":4,"has_smoking?":true,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":0,"has_diabetes?":false,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["outbreak"],[],[],["analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[["risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk","risk"],[],[],[],["infecti","infecti","infecti"],[],[],["age"],[],[],["health","health"],[],[],[],[],["generat"],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"b741ebc747e054216b184b572bbe130bb9d772bd","title_x":"Covid 19 pandemic and gynaecological laparoscopic surgery: knowns and unknowns","abstract_x":"The worldwide impact of COVID 19 continues to be felt as hospitals in all countries reduce elective and nonurgent cases to allow staffing and resources to be deployed elsewhere.

These principles should be followed, in suspected or confirmed COVID 19 patients, to reduce the potential transmission risk (Figure 1) . The safety of all members of the team is of the utmost importance and can be facilitated by operating in a safe, structured environment.\n1. Non-surgical treatments should be utilised where possible to reduce the risk of horizontal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus to health care workers, and reduce the need for hospital admission, provided they are a safe alternative.\n2. Patients should be risk assessed for potential SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Consider universal SARS-CoV-2 virology screening in all patients undergoing surgery. Patients testing negative can proceed with the standard laparoscopic technique and routine surgical infection control procedures. the overall risk may be lower with open surgery as an artificial pneumoperitoneum is not created and maintained. During laparoscopic procedures, the risk of aerosol generation is increased during insertion, and particularly removal, of trocars from a pressurised peritoneal cavity. This can result in dispersion of body fluids especially where port sites are contaminated with blood or other human tissues.\nAs this pandemic progresses, the need to continue operating in emergency situations such as ectopic pregnancies on suspected or confirmed COVID 19 patients will increase.\nHypothetical risks of viral transmission must be balanced against the significant benefits of adopting a minimally invasive approach, namely reduced morbidity and mortality, shorter hospital stay and quicker return to daily activities (Snyman et al., 2017 , Aarts et al., 2015 .\nThese advantages have gained even more significance in helping to maintain wider public health, in light of the pressure on health care resources imposed by this pandemic.\nThe evidence so far does not suggest an increased risk of COVID 19 transmission during gynaecological laparoscopic surgery when personal protective equipment (PPE) is used.\nMolecular studies have detected viral RNA in a range of bodily specimens from COVID 19 patients, including upper and lower respiratory tract samples, faeces and blood, indicating the potential presence of infectious virus. SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected in faeces in 29% of cases , presumably thorough transmission from the naso-pharynx with ingestion into the gastrointestinal tract. However, it is less commonly found in blood, with studies reporting viral RNA positive samples in 1-15% of COVID 19 patients , Chen W et al., 2020 , Young et al., 2020 , Chan et al., 2020 , Huang et al., 2020 . The virus has not been found in the female genital tract in women with proven COVID 19, although the data are few , Fan et al., 2020 . Hence operations carried out by other specialities such as ENT and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy are at a higher risk of generating aerosols and have more significant safety concerns (RCS, 2020) . Moreover, bowel surgery may have different implications compared to gynaecological interventions. Thus, there is currently insufficient evidence to support adopting a universal open approach to surgery for gynaecological indications.\nThe Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) along with the British Society for Gynaecological Endoscopists (BSGE) recently released a statement on gynaecological 3. If urgent surgery is required and testing is not possible, manage as suspected COVID 19 with precautions described.\n4. Hospitals should have clear pathways and make theatre allocations to separate a. COVID 19 positive patients b. Clinical emergencies c. Clinically urgent cases d. Trauma patients 5. The laparoscopic procedures should be undertaken by the most experienced surgeon available to ensure full knowledge of safe laparoscopic procedures are followed and to ensure that the procedure is performed in the shortest time possible.\n6. To protect operating staff:\na. Enhanced PPE is mandatory for all theatre personnel (i.e. disposable gloves, disposable fluidresistant gown, filtering face piece class 2 or 3 or N95 respirator and disposable eye protection) b. In order to minimise possible exposure and to guard against depletion of PPE stock, ensure that only staff that are required for the procedure are present in theatre c. Theatre staff need to be versed in self-protection strategies against suction materials and blood contaminated areas in theatres and in laparoscopic suction in line with local protocols 7. To aid artificial ventilation a. Operating pressures should be kept as low as possible b. Minimise the amount of Trendelenburg 8. To prevent and manage aerosol dispersion a. Caution and care should be taken during insufflation b. Special attention should be paid to port sites to prevent explosive dispersion of body fluids both at the insertion\/removal of trocars and specimen retrieval c. Limit the number of incisions where possible, although there should be enough port sites to allow safe and expeditious surgery d. Ensure that incisions are of appropriate size to prevent leakage during the procedure e. Minimise exchange of instruments to minimise leakage f. Caution when using ultrasonic devices as the potential for aerosol generationmay be higher.\ng. Employ electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices in a manner that minimises surgical smoke production with low power settings and avoidance of prolonged activation h. Suction devices, smoke evacuation filters, retrieval devices and swabs should be used to: (1) prevent aerosol transmission: remove smoke, aerosol and the CO 2 pneumoperitoneum during surgery and (2) avoid explosive dispersion of body fluids when removing trocars and retrieving specimens. 9. Only evacuate surgical smoke via the tap on ports when attached to a smoke evacuation filter and \/ or by direct suction using a vacuum suction unit.\n10. Only evacuate the pneumoperitoneum via direct suction using a vacuum suction unit.\n11.

The basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 [12] . The mortality of the 27 included patients infected by 2019-nCoV was 37%, which is much higher than that reported 2% on 4 Feb 2020 [3] . Giving the priority of 2019-nCoV detection to severe cases because of shortness of test kits in our hospital initially and potential false negative results of 2019-nCoV viral RNA detection in mild cases might account for this discrepancy. Consistent with recent reports, our results suggest that 2019-nCoV is more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities as a result of the weaker immune functions of these patients [5, 6] , and 2019-nCoV-associated death is also related to elder age and underlying illnesses, especially hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac disease.\nConsistently with several recent reports regarding to CT findings of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia (NCIP) [13] [14] [15] , our results showed that CT manifestations of NCIP were featured by predominant ground glass opacities (GGO) (67%) mixed with consolidations (30%), mainly peripheral (26%) or combined peripheral and central distributions (74%), bilateral (86%) and lower lung zones (96%) being mostly involved. Merely consolidation, central distribution only, pleural effusions or lymphadenopathy were relatively rarely seen. Initially the CT images might be GGO nodules or patchy GGO mostly peripherally distributed then consolidations and extensive distributions were seen when pneumonia progressed. Consolidation, air bronchogram, extensive distribution as well as multiple involved lung zones were more common in mortality group, suggesting a more severe clinical course for these abnormalities can be pathologically correlated with diffuse alveolar damage and similar conclusions can be drawn in H1N1 pneumonia, H5N1 pneumonia, H7N9 pneumonia and SARS [9, [16] [17] [18] . As members of the same virus family, NCIP shared much common ground with MERS and SARS in CT features. Subpleural and basilar airspace lesions with GGOs and consolidations were conspicuous CT characteristics of all three kinds of virus pneumonia, but pleural effusions are more common in patients who died of MERS [19] [20] [21] [22] . Comprehensively evaluated the CT features of NCIP, we calculated the CT score of each patient. The CT scores were much higher in mortality group compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12 (IQR 11-43), 0.021), P = 0.021) on admission. In mortality group the scores markedly increased in a short time (12 (IQR 5-24.5) vs 20 (IQR 15-46), P = 0.042), suggesting a progressive course of NCIP. Although the CT scores were not diminished, they maintained a relatively stable level for a period of time in survival group (12 (IQR 6-12) vs 12 (IQR 6-15), P = 0.237), suggesting that it might take a long time to recover in chest imaging when NCIP was under controlled. We found an optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 (sensitivity of 85.6% and specificity of 84.5%) to predict mortality. We hope the simple scoring method according to CT scans may help triage patients and screening patients who need more aggressive treatment and closely monitoring. However, the efficacy of such approach to decrease mortality remains to be validated in future studies. Although a definite diagnosis of NCIP cannot be achieved by using imaging features alone for most viral pneumonia imaging patterns share similarity, the CT features summarized above might be helpful in differentiation various pathogens of pneumonia and in triage patients.\nThere were limitations in our study. First it was a retrospective study including only 27 inpatients, while outpatients and suspected but undiagnosed cases for deficiency of detection kits of 2019-nCoV and potential false negative results were ruled out. Second, not all information was collected because a significant part of patients had not rechecked CT scans. Then, it was pulmonologists, although they are experienced, who evaluated CT images. Finally there was a lack of information regarding interobserver agreement, because the study emphasis on the final consensus interpretation rather than independent reading.","publish_time_x":"2020-03-19","authors_x":"Yuan, Mingli; Yin, Wen; Tao, Zhaowu; Tan, Weijun; Hu, Yi","journal_x":"PLoS One","doi_x":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0230548","H index_x":null,"section":"PLOS ONE","total_rank":0.0573630137,"risk_factors":["diabetes"],"match_indices":[2610],"smoking_count":0,"has_smoking?":false,"smoking_in_title":false,"diabetes_count":1,"has_diabetes?":true,"diabetes_in_title":false,"pregnancy_count":0,"has_pregnancy?":false,"pregnancy_in_title":false,"tuberculosis_count":0,"has_tuberculosis?":false,"tuberculosis_in_title":false,"design_x":[[],[],[],[],[],["surviv","surviv","surviv","surviv"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["analysi"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],["retrospective study"],[]],"design_rank":42,"outcomes":[[],[],[],[],[],["reproducti"],[],["age","age","age","age","age","age"],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]],"outcome_rank":19,"section_rank":5,"H index_y":null,"abstract_y":null,"authors_y":null,"design_y":null,"doi_y":null,"full_text_x":null,"is_covid_related":null,"journal_y":null,"publish_time_y":null,"relevant_section":null,"risk_factor":null,"title_y":null,"full_text_y":null,"scibert_summary":null},{"doc_id":"92ab5b61b296652be2d16d5b29918ead488e5915","title_x":"Correspondence to: An evidence-based framework for priority clinical research questions for COVID-19","abstract_x":"Background On 31 December, 2019, the World Health Organization China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology. Since then, there have been over 75 000 cases globally of the 2019 novel coronavirus , 2000 deaths, and over 14 000 cases recovered. Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action. In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak.\n Methods Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting. Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed. In February 2020, available information on COVID19 was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review.\n From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control\/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. For COVID19, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled.\n Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for COVID-19, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols. Databased on internationally standardised protocols will inform clinical practice real-time.","text_body":"navirus presentation resembles that of SARS: a viral pneumonia with fever, cough, dyspnoea, and fatigue.

Chen One report of pregnant patients demonstrated similar symptomology to non-pregnant patients. They also established that there was no evidence of vertical transmission to the child [11] . In the only study of infants with COVID-19, Wei et al. reported fever and upper respiratory symptoms common among nine infants. All infants were infected via family clusters [12] . Finally, radiological studies attempted to characterise the course of disease in chest imaging. Pan et al. report peak lung involvement at 10 days on CT studies [13] . Of note is a case series by Xie et al. that reported ground glass opacity in five patients with initial negative RT-PCR findings but suspected COVID-19. They were later confirmed to be infected [14] .\nOverall, clinical characterisation studies commonly found bilateral involvement with ground glass opacity, though a range of presentations were reported [8] [9] [10] 15] .\nWhat are the risk factors for death or severe illness?\nWhile risk factors for death and severe illness cannot be firmly established without large groups of patient data and multi-variable adjusted methods, some studies report similar risk factors among cohorts.

In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de S\u00e3o Janu\u00e1rio (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020. Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)\/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay. In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases. The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days. Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation. No fatal cases were noted. The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%). In the \"Severe\" group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C-Reactive protein levels compared to the \"Mild to Moderate\" group (p<0.001). There were positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals in all patients' NPS and stool specimens but negative in all urine specimens. Based on our data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in stool and the possibility of a lag in viral detection in NPS specimens, the assessment of both fecal and respiratory specimen is recommended to enhance diagnostic sensitivity, and also to aid discharge decision before the role of viral RNA shedding in stool is clarified.","text_body":"This report includes 10 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. All patients (100%) were admitted to the isolation ward, and none of them required ICU transfer. Their demographic and clinical information are summarized in Table 1 . The median age of the patients was 54 years old (IQR:27-64). Three patients were male (30%) and one was a teenager (age 15 years) ( Table 1) . For the seven imported cases, the median duration from Macau entry to hospital admission was three days (IQR:2-4). Of these 10 patients, five (50%) had one or more coexisting medical conditions, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and hepatitis B infection. The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%) followed by coughing (50%), dyspnea (50%), sore throats (50%), nausea (50%) and myalgia (30%). Less common symptoms included rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, dizziness, and abdominal pain. One patient (patient 6) remained asymptomatic during the whole course. In our cohort, there were 20% mild, 40% moderate, and 40% severe cases based on the criteria stated above. No patient was categorized as \"Critical.\" The MuLBSTA score [6] , which is a model proposed in 2019 for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia and consists of six indices including multi-lobular infiltration, lymphopenia, bacterial co-infection, smoking history, hypertension and age, was calculated.
