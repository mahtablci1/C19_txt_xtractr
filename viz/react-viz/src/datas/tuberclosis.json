All of the patients were smear negative and clinician who performed the procedure was very anxious and wanted to know if they are false positive or not. We convinced her to wait for the results and we screened the unit by using Clean-Trace Surface ATP and Clean-Trace Water ATP tests (3 M, USA) and also obtained samples from bronchoscopes and the environment for smear examination and culture. 6 In our unit automated washing machines are used and high level disinfection is done by orthophthalaldehyde (OPA). ATP levels were in acceptable limits and mycobacteria is not detected in those samples. Five of 6 patients remained culture negative and therapy was not given. Among other culture negative patients, 3 of them were trace positive and we have learned that they have had TB treatment previously. In the other two patients, low level PCR positivitiy in BAL samples was supported by clinical and radiological findings therefore they have received TB treatment. Dorman et al. 5 enrolled 2368 participants for sputum sampling and the study was done at ten reference laboratories in eight countries (South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, India, China, Georgia, Belarus, and Brazil). The sensitivity of Expert Ultra was 63% for the 137 participants with smear-negative and culture-positive sputum. 19 (44%) of 43 participants with a positive Xpert Ultra test but no positive culture had trace and only 2 had M. tuberculosis identified on a follow-up culture .

Inconsistent culture and PCR results is a big challenge for clinicians. False positive results can be related with amplification of dead bacilli from environmental contamination or previous TB treatment. 5 , 7 False positivity is related with endoscopic procedure in our study and despite high level disinfection the surface of the bronchoscope remained positive for mycobacterium DNA.","risk_factor":["sputum","sputum","environmental","race","race","race","race","race","race","race","tubercul","tubercul","tubercul","tubercul","TB","TB","TB"],"design":[],"rank":4,"doi":"10.1016\/j.jinf.2019.11.014","abstract":null,"publish_time":"2020-03-31","authors":"Haixu, Liang; Haibin, Wang; Lili, Ren","journal":"Journal of Infection","text_body":"custom_license"},{"doc_id":"544de0b37a1bfef02405733cf09c673c0fffd7d2","title":"Letters to the Editor Emergence of a novel coronavirus causing respiratory illness from Wuhan, China Declaration of Competing Interest","relevant_section":"Although 33 (4.9%) samples were PCR positive, we could not isolate M. tuberculosis from 11 samples.
